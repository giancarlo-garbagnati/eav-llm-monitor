rivian,Tire replacement. Issues at Costco.,"I’m at about 14K miles on the factory Pirelli 22"" tires on my R1S, and they’re already due for replacement, which I know isn’t surprising, since many of us have experienced how short-lived these OEM tires can be.

Today, I got a quote from America's Tire for a set of Michelin Defenders (22""), which seem to be the most commonly recommended replacement in this group. While I was at Costco, I figured I’d swing by their tire center to see if they’d beat the quote, since America’s Tire mentioned they offer price matching.

But Costco told me they couldn’t install the Michelin Defenders because my door jam label specifies ""HL"" for Heavy Load, meaning I’m limited to tires like the Pirellis that meet that rating.

Has anyone else run into this issue? Were you able to find a workaround or an alternative HL-rated tire?",10,2025-07-11 17:50:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1lxnese/tire_replacement_issues_at_costco/,https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1lxnese/tire_replacement_issues_at_costco/

rivian,Vibration and humming noise from the front end,"I have a late 2022 R1T (11/22 build date) with 37k miles. Rivian SC replaced my front axles and hubs/bearings about a month ago. When I picked it up I started hearing a hollow humming noise from my front end (feels like front left wheel). I've had them look at it last week and they said everything is fine and that it must be my ""aftermarket"" tires (brand new 21"" Michelin Defenders). They seem to be unwilling to diagnose it further unless I put Pirellis back on there. It's mostly noticeable at high speeds but now that I've tuned into it I hear it at lower speed as well. Jumping on the freeway today it has gotten louder, I'll try and record a video clip.

rivian,DC to Austin: Days 2 and 3,"Day 1 DC to Knoxville:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/s/2JNwYhttux

Day 2: Knoxville to Bryant, AK
We stayed over night in downtown Knoxville which was great. A public parking lot down the street from our hotel offered free L2 charging and parking over night was only $2! The best charging deal we saw the whole trip.

Chargers are plentiful in TN, but thin out a lot in AK. We hit Tesla superchargers at the Crossville, TN Bucc-ee’s and the Casey Jones Museum in Jacksonville, TN. Both worked fine (Crossville had reports of broken Superchargers on PlugShare?), but we went a little rogue parking. We also hit up a charger in Nashville in a parking garage near Party Fowl when we went for lunch. The charger was fine, but the parking lot company (Park Happy LLC) uses text to pay and it didn’t work so we got hit with an $80 parking violation. Their website has a prominent link to dispute parking violation fines, so I’m guessing this is a common issue. I certainly didn’t park happy.

Day 3: Bryant, AK to Austin, TX
We intended to charge overnight at the hotel in Bryant, which we picked because it had chargers. This was a mistake. The hotel chargers are from StaynCharge, which is total garbage. StaynCharge required an app (ugh) and preloading $$ (double ugh). The cost per kWH was outrageous ($0.65–triple ugh). Even though I set up auto load and auto load took more of my money twice, the car stopped charging after my original money limit was hit after only 2 hours of charging (UGHHHH). So we woke up to a mostly uncharged car. Only positive is that the app has an option to refund the auto loaded money.

Luckily, we’d kept the charge high through TN (knowing AK was a bit of a dead zone), so we had enough charge to get somewhere with a functioning charger. But it added time to our trip we’d hoped to avoid.

Once we hit Texarkana, things got better. We stopped in Dallas for a late lunch at the White Rock Alehouse & Brewery (be sure to try Dave’s Perfect Pils) then tried to charge up before hitting the road, but had to skip the first charger because it was full. We scooted down the road to a Tesla supercharger. We also hit up the Bucc-ee’s in temple to was the bugs off before arriving in Austin. It did better than expected LOL, though some bugs remain.

Overall, not too bad. I had a bit of charge anxiety about AK, but our style of stopping frequently (and charging whenever we stopped) worked well.

CarRepair,"My Mercedes C300, 2015, Sedan 4 Matic, Sport Trim, recently encountered the P0299 Check Engine Code (Need Genuine Opinions)","My Mercedes C300, 2015 has had the turbo replaced and the CCV kit replaced as well. The turbo itself is under warranty. The car has 294,000KMS on engine. Yes, it’s old, but whatever. 

Moreover, randomly the car will drive fine then if I try to push it harder by accelerating hard on runways, it will enter limp mode without a check engine light. The one time the check engine light did come on, I reset the code. If I turn car off then back on and drive it, it’ll have power again as if it’s fine, however, moment I get aggressive with the gas throttle, it tends to enter limp mode without a check engine light always coming on. I never replaced my boost pressure sensor. I noticed my CCV kit when the mechanic installed has broken the rubber piece inside it, so a buddy of mine tried to seal it for me and used strong adhesive, would this be the issue? I attached the image. 

Any help goes a long way. I do plan on getting it diagnosed professionally, just want to see if anyone has any advice cause most mechanics seem to contradict each other and have no real clue what’s really happening. 

Changed:
-Brand new Mercedes Turbo with manufacture warranty on turbo it self not installation cause got installed at private mechanic shop. 
-Brand new CCV kit. 


Curious:
-why car runs fine most times but when I go into sport plus mode and aggressively accelerate it enters that limp mode stage, and the car loses a lot of power as if no more turbo. 
-car is tuned and has an ECU Stage 2 Tune with careless Armytrix down pipe. 

Thanks all for your advice and feedback in advance!

CarRepair,VW Polo Mk5 2012 (UK) parking sensor issue,"Had this car for 5 and a half years and this is the first time this has happened. Having an issue where the right sensor automatically comes on (max level) when I’m driving or when I’m parked, even though there’s nothing next to me.

Not sure if it’s the front right sensors or the rear right sensors.

It happened randomly 4/5 hours after I got my car washed 6 days ago, and is still happening. It happens at random times. I have to turn my car off then on again for it to stop, then it will happen randomly again. Or sometimes it just stops without me turning my car off, and will then come back on again randomly.

You can see on the dashboard where the sensor indicators are, the left one is on level 1 with an amber colour, but the right one is on max level with flashing red lights.

I’ve wiped all of the sensors with a cloth.

My car doesn’t have a parking sensor off/mute button.

This is what it says in the car handbook:
“Switching the parking distance warning system on and off
• Switching on: Select reverse gear while the ignition is switched on.
• Switching off: Drive forwards faster than approximately 15 km/h (6 - 9 mph).”

I’m driving forwards faster than 10mph and it stays on.

Got it services and oil checked after buying. Mechanic indicated no major faults. The AC wasn't 100% so had it looked at. 
First long trip abt 200km (2 days after buying),car reached destination without issues, but soon after started having a belt slipping kind of noise (originating somewhere around the left wheel area). The sound was present whenever I turned on the car and would soon go away. 
But after 3 or 4 times (short trips, inside residential area, 1 to 2 kms) the power steering turned off, the sound became permanent and the AC started blowing hot air.

Power steering is no longer working, all fluids are present in the right amount, tyre pressure is okay. I'm scared of turning it on now. 
All help appreciated.

Edit: The sound sounded like a belt malfunctioning, some Google searching indicated it might be something called a serpentine belt or a related pulley, which may be a shared component.

MechanicAdvice,Please help tail light issue!,"2006 Kia Spectra – Right Tail Light Keeps Going Out (Electrical Issue?)

I’ve got a 2006 Kia Spectra with about 87k miles. It’s in solid shape overall, but I’ve been dealing with a really frustrating electrical issue. The right tail light keeps going out shortly after it’s replaced.

I’ve taken it to the shop three times. One mechanic said the electrical harness might be going bad — but apparently they don’t make a replacement for this model anymore. Another said it could be my spoiler light pulling too much power, so they disconnected that. But even after that, the tail light keeps going out.

I’m worried about driving around with a light out, but I can’t afford a bunch of pricey electrical work or constant repairs. The car runs fine otherwise, and I’d really like to keep it going without sinking a bunch of money into it.

Is there anything else I should check? Are there workarounds for an old harness like this? Any advice would be really appreciated. I just want a fix that’ll last.

MechanicAdvice,2004 F150 | 5.4L Triton,"My truck has been messed up. It is a 2004 F150 Lariat King Ranch Edition RWD with a 5.4 L Triton engine (I know, these things have issues) with 220k miles.
  
Si far, I have replaced the spark plugs, starter, fuel injectors, ignition coils, fuel filter, fuel pump, MAF sensor, O2 sensors, and smoke tested for any leaks. It has codes for system being too rich and too lean. I have recently had worse issues with it.  
  
Today I had a new issue. You can hear the noise in the video, the entire truck shakes while it does that. I was pulsing the gass in the video so it could be heard better. It barely wants to go from 0-20 and puts off an awful smell when doing so, I dont recognize the smell as I have never had a vehicle this messed up. The low oil pressure warning occasionally kicks on. The truck shut off two times today. I was on my way to my brother's house and the battery light came on and engine shut off. I just started it back and there was no issue. When leaving, I came to a turn and it shut off while I was turning and I did the same thing. I droce it home and just didn't stop for anything and it made it back. I dont really want to start it again without any guidance, as I am not really sure what is wrong.  
  
I can replace things and do fine with mechanic work, but I only know a lot about the things that I have already done. My next plans were to change the cam sensors and egr valve. If that does nothing then I'll bite the bullet and replace the timing chain.  
  
Guidance would be much appreciated. Would I be best off selling the hunk of junk and trying to buy something new? It obviously wont sell for a lot and I can't afford anything that isn’t going to have problems, so I dont want to fully reset since I have already done some work on it. I did not do proper research on the engine before buying the truck, lesson learned.",1,2025-07-11 21:04:09,https://v.redd.it/10v9hivvadcf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1lxr4do/2004_f150_54l_triton/

The vehicle steering pulls and does not return to center. They have done four alignments on the vehicle and still not rectify it.

I truly believe this is not a mechanical issue and more an issue with the electric power steering. I have attached a video of my scanner showing they delivered torque value from the steering control module. Turning the vehicle to the right everything seems OK but when I turn the vehicle to the left, the value skyrockets past the expected range. My local Cadillac dealer says this is perfectly normal, which I somehow can’t believe.

I have tested the battery along with insured connections, and grounds are tight. My last resort would be replacing the power steering rack.

My father has a 2003 Toyota Sienna. Awhile ago the ABS and tir e pressure sensor light came on. He recently took the car to a mechanic and they tried to change a sensor on one of the wheels but that didn't make any difference so they put the old one back on.

MechanicAdvice,2005 Honda CRV vibrates when in drive with foot on break,"I hit a pothole on my passenger side pretty hard, ever since thin my car has been vibrating while in drive with my foot on the break, not constantly but usually comes up at least once every drive. It only happens in drive with foot on the break, not neutral not reverse

When I originally spoke to a mechanic over the phone they said to take it to Les Schwab first because it most likely has something to do with the suspension or wheel since that's where the impact came from, but they said they was no visible damage or anything wrong with the car from that standpoint (Les Schwab I know)

I then pop the hood and see when I switch gears the engine moves forward and backwards - ChatGPT says this is from a passenger side engine mount failure. I take it to a mechanic and they said they inspected and ""the DRIVER side mount is moving the most"" I'm extremely confused here because all signs point to the passenger side mount (car hit impact, forward backward engine movement) could the problem really be the driver side mount? I'm worried they will get me to pay for it, it won't solve the issue then I end up paying for the next mount....

MechanicAdvice,"Need advice on 2011 Equinox LT 2.4 ecotech, exhaust manifold.","Long story short my muffler rusted and had to be replaced.  Shop told me that he thinks the manifold is broken but he is unsure if it is the cat and the manifold since he was looking from the vantage point of the muffler.  Vehicle does have oil consumption issues because, Equinox.  I am not a mechanically inclined per say, but can follow step by step instructions.  It is possible that the hubby and I could buy the manifold and tools that we don't have and manage based off the video that I have seen but would take us a couple of days likely to do.  We do still have a loan on the vehicle, which I plan on having paid off within a year or less, so I figure we have 3 options:

Opt 1-  Try changing it out ourselves.  It looks straight forward but time consuming.  We have been mostly successful at various simple jobs like MAF sensor, solenoids, and PCV stuff on cars and lawn mowers.

Opt 2- Call around and find the best price, eat the 400 to 500 labor cost and hope it isn't the cat as well as.  I don't plan on sinking 4 grand into a car worth 5,000.

  
Opt 3- Not fix it and plunk the money down on the loan to pay it off faster, hope that it doesn't croak beforehand.   

We are planning to get another vehicle once this one is paid, (I am sticking to Toyota and Honda and hell with low mileage) and will just run this one until it dies either way and then scrap it.

MechanicAdvice,"ISSUE – Seat Ibiza 1.2 TDI 2011 – Glow Plug Light Flashing, Power Loss, Occasional Check Engine Light","Hey everyone,
I’m having an ongoing and very annoying issue with my Seat Ibiza 1.2 TDI from 2011 (3-cylinder diesel engine).

Here’s what’s happening:
	•	While driving, the glow plug light starts flashing intermittently
	•	When it happens, the car loses power, starts vibrating, and feels like it’s struggling
	•	Sometimes, the Check Engine Light (CEL) also comes on, but it turns off by itself after restarting the engine a couple of times

Strange part:
	•	If I turn the car off and back on, the issue disappears temporarily
	•	Sometimes it doesn’t happen for weeks, then suddenly it’s back again
	•	The CEL only shows up occasionally, and doesn’t always stay on

What I’ve done so far:
	•	I’ve cleaned the fuel tank (I thought it could be sediment or dirty diesel)
	•	No ECU tuning or modifications
	•	I always fuel up at decent stations

I’ve read it could be:
	•	A DPF (FAP) issue
	•	A bad or clogged EGR valve
	•	A faulty brake pedal sensor (heard this causes flashing glow plug lights on VAG cars)
	•	Or maybe a failing injector

I haven’t done a proper VCDS or OBD scan yet, but I plan to soon.
Has anyone experienced something similar with this engine?
Any idea where I should start looking or what error codes to expect?

Any help would be much appreciated. 🙏

MechanicAdvice,Has my brand new starter motor kicked the bucket?,"Starter motor was getting very tired/ slow on a car that im working on/ trying to get going (Audi Q7, 3.0TDI).   
Replaced with a new starter motor, which turned over fast at first, then started to get tired like the battery was going flat - thing is the battery is new (fully charged) and even with jump cables connected to another car started to barely crank the car. I removed the glow plugs (to make sure it wasn't hydrolocking with fuel) and barely made a difference, even with glow plugs out.  
Now, It barely cranks the car, even though you can turn the car over by hand (with a socket and breaker bar). It also used to crank for ages, but now only does about 2 slow revolutions and gives up. 

I put a multimeter on battery, and the crank voltage drops to 10-11v.   
I then put multimeter on engine ground and starter solenoid contact, and another test to the main positive cable, and volt drops to the same, 10-11v when cranking, which should be more than enough?  
  
Which tells me it has to be the starter motor right?  
I have also lost contact with ECU through OBD and the car seems to have a multitude of electrical issues, but if the start motor is getting full voltage, the crank issue has to be with the starter, right?

I bought a 2013 Dodge Journey from a family friend not too long ago. Ever since i got it, I have had an issue where if i don’t drive my car for a day, the battery will die. I never had any lights show on my dash.

I took it to the mechanic and they told me it was an issue with the alternator and replaced it.
when i went to pick my car up from the mechanic, my car felt more jittery then normal. about 15 minutes into my drive home, my battery light came on. 

I took it for a drive a couple hours later to make sure it was driving ok. Shortly after I started the car I got a message saying something along the lines of “Park Assist System”. I didn’t make it far before both speedometers stopped telling me how fast i was going, my ac stopped working (would turn on and off repeatedly blowing hot air), my windows wouldn’t roll down, and my screen controlling my climate, radio, etc turned off.

Battery reads 13.07v at idle under load (lights, rear defroster, AC, etc.) and a.voltage drop off the alternator of 0.21v.

MechanicAdvice,Bad Torque Converter or Transmission?,"1999 Honda Accord EX 3.0 

I purchased this vehicle for cheap from a friend, and for the past year, they experienced ongoing transmission issues. While driving, the car jerks and struggles to shift smoothly. More recently, I’ve noticed a loud clunk when shifting into any gear with the brake applied (automatic transmission). The impact is sometimes severe enough to stall the engine.

Additionally, there's a noticeable 1 to 1.5-second delay between selecting a gear and the transmission engaging. During this delay, I can hear a grinding sound, somewhat similar to lightly pressing metal against a bench grinder.

Transmission fluid appears to be in good condition with no burnt smell. I'm currently having difficulty sourcing a used transmission, and I'm wondering if this could be an issue with the torque converter instead.

I put in a new Delco upstream O2 sensor (xzz) and changed ignition wires and the coil pack as well as changing the spark plug on cylinder 2. ( Did all of this while out of town and then drove 300 miles back home with no issues.)

I am not getting both lean and Rich codes(p0171 & p0172) as well as the p0406. 

Could this just mean a bad erg valve? Could it cause a all 3 codes...or could these codes indirectly be related to the O2 sensor? I know that sometimes you can unfortunately get a dud but I am just at a loss.

MechanicAdvice,Blown Motor or Bad CPS?,"2015 ram ecodiesel 3.0

About a month ago, I went to pass someone, truck revved high 3500-4500 rpm’s I passed them with ease then quickly lost all power. Motor was still idling but wouldn’t rev. I coasted to a flat spot off the road and and shut the truck off. While waiting for the tow I started it again, it started but idled very rough, I gave it some throttle it barely moved and sounded awful. I shut it off and had it towed. 

Next day I try to start it, cranked normally but no start. I’ve let it sit now about a month, went out and just for fun went to start it, barely cracks now. Got a brand new battery, same thing cranks exactly 2 revolutions then stops. 

Only dtc code it’s throwing is P061C-00. 

With this information is it likely a blown motor or the cps sensor? 

I’m willing to pull trans and change sensor/ring but want to know if there’s a definitive way to tell if it’s the sensor or motor is trashed. I’ve read they’re bad about cracks going bad, worried this is my issue.

MechanicAdvice,"2006 Pontiac Grand Prix GXP, 5.3L LS4 - Intermittent Start/Stall Led to Deep Dive - Found No Bank 2 Fuel Trim, ETC Issues. Need Help! Usually able to fix simple stuff myself but after hours in the garage I am begging for mercy.","Hey everyone, seeking guidance from the community on r/MechanicAdvice! My 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix GXP with the 5.3L LS4 is having intermittent start-and-stall issues. Sometimes it starts and runs correctly. Other times, it cranks, catches briefly, and stalls immediately unless the throttle is used. An OBD-II scanner was used for diagnostics.

Diagnostic Data:

1. **Bank 2 Fuel Trims:** Missing Data
   * No data is received for Bank 2 fuel trims (STFT2 and LTFT2) when monitoring live data. The scanner displays them as a dash that does not change through a drive cycle, although the engine seems to be running on Bank 2 (no noticeable misfires), the computer provides no feedback for it.
2. **Bank 1 Fuel Trims: Negative LTFT**
   * LTFT1: \[-10%\]
   * STFT1: \[0%\] (at idle)
   * I found a hole in the intake boot while trying to diagnose this, and assumed I had solved the issue, but I know a lean condition from a vacuum leak should cause positive fuel trims as the computer adds to compensate. The negative LTFT suggests a rich condition on Bank 1.
3. **Throttle Position Discrepancy**
   * A discrepancy between the ""Commanded Throttle Position"" and the ""Actual Throttle Position"" PIDs on the scanner. With the ignition on (engine off), slowly depressing the accelerator pedal shows the ""Actual"" not smoothly or immediately tracking the ""Commanded."" It sometimes lags or is slightly off. I cleaned the throttle body, but it didn't solve this either.

My goal is to fix this with the tools I have. Featuring my mom's cameraman skills.",1,2025-07-11 15:23:02,https://v.redd.it/qeaed1bmlbcf1,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1lxk837/2006_pontiac_grand_prix_gxp_53l_ls4_intermittent/

MechanicAdvice,Any guesses on what the problem could be?,"Howdy y’all. A few months ago I purchased a 2016 Hyundai Veloster R-spec with a 1.6l 4cyl engine sitting at 76k miles. I know, I should have done my research before buying a Hyundai, it was my first time buying a car and what’s done is done. 
Recently I went on a trip out of town, and after about 90 minutes of driving, as I was on the highway my AC cut off. I didn’t know this was a warning sign and kept driving, and 15 minutes later the car wouldn’t get any gas. It shifted gears fine, but the rpms dropped to zero and it wouldn’t accelerate. I had to roll off the highway, and once I stopped the car it turned off and wouldn’t turn back on. The lights come on but the car makes a kind of wheezing/whirring noise.
This issue came out of nowhere, when I bought the car there was proper maintenance history and no damage, and I have only put 2,600 additional miles on the vehicle. My check engine light did turn on about a month ago, but the DTC was P0299 and at the time I couldn’t spend any money on resolving it.
I got the car towed to a mechanic who said my engine is “completely burnt up and in need of replacement. They quoted me a minimum 8k (not including labor) for a used engine with 90k miles. This is extremely suspicious to me and I will be visiting another mechanic for a second opinion, but I thought I would see if anyone has a clue about what this could mean before I pay for another tow.

MechanicAdvice,ABS and VSC on 07 Camry!!,"ok reddit i need your help!!

i drive a 2007 Camry xle, its in pretty good condition, no accidents, new battery,  relatively new breaks and sparks, clean v6 engine at only 100k miles. and its been **pretty much** fine accept earlier today. 

after idling for maybe 5 mins i turned my car off and sat there for a another 5 or so, and then tried to start my car to leave and it barely cranked but no flip, all the dash lights came on for a second and then just the abs and vsc light stayed on and the warning screen said "" check vsc system"" . its and push to start if that helps at all. the ac got a little louder before i turned the car off but i didn't think it was concerning. i tried a second time and the breaks got stiff. so i called for a jump and it was fine after that. its done this and something similar twice before. 

once a little less than 2 and a half months ago, i was dropping my sister off and same thing i sat in the parking lot for a second, probably only 1 or 2 mins and then turned the car off. then when i went to start it it cranked for a second and then died, same lights came on. i tried a second time that time as well, the dash flickered on and off like it didn't even have enough power for that, or just couldn't fully turn the lights on and then died. i jumped it, started fine, lights went off, i tested the battery at it was just over 12v, and thats all she wrote.

  
until about two weeks ago. i was driving my mom and we pulled off on the side of the road for directions. same thing. i sat there for about 2 mins but this time i only got a ding, like your seatbelt ding, but only once. i looked at the dash and didn't see anything, then 30 seconds maybe a minuet later same ding and the vsc light just flashed, maybe 5-10 seconds if that then the light disappeared. it did it 2 more times while we were figuring out what to do and then we just headed home. no issues driving or anything, i think we had the ac on again but neither of us remember. after that no issue until today.

  
my abs and vsc systems work fine, ive recently had to slam my breaks and i felt the abs kick on. all my fluids are good, oil is still good, gas cap clicks and is tight, temps and rpm are fine. haven't checked the fuses or any of my censors but nothing else has trouble. i really have no idea what it could be.

MechanicAdvice,2013 Elantra GL 1.8L: Crank with no start when hot,"Yay! More Elantra issues!

I have a 2013 Elantra 1.8L (126XXX km)  that within the last two weeks has taken to the following:

1. On a cold start, it will crank, start, then immediately the engine cuts out (stalls?). This is intermittent. Usually when it happens, it will crank, fire, and start as normal on the second go.
2. On a warm-hot start (ie, drive for 15-20+min, then stop the engine and restart) it will crank and crank and crank and crank and not fire. If I let the engine sit for 5-10 minutes, it'll usually fire up fine again.

  
I have scoured the web for causes, and so far I have changed the spark plugs (unrelated, but I was going to do them anyway) and changed the crankshaft position sensor. Once I changed the crank sensor, the problem went away for a couple days and now it's back.

My thoughts: We're getting air, fuel, and spark. When I turn the key to acc, I can hear the buzz of the fuel pump priming. When it is cranking and not firing, I tried turning the key on and off of acc to prime the fuel pump further, but that did not help. Spark, well, I just changed the plugs. Air, I just cleaned out the engine air filter and noticed some carbon around the throttle body, so cleaning that is on my to-do, but I don't suspect that it's causing this. When the car runs, there's no hesitation or lag; I can redline it fine and it never seems to hesitate as though it was starved for one of the three. This said, I think it may be a synchronization issue between engine and computer (ie, crank / cam sensor is borked therefore computer is not letting the injectors fire because it thinks the cam isn't clocked correctly?)

  
After changing the crank sensor, it idles a lot better - it would 'hiccup' (?) when warm and idling, going from \~800 to \~1200 RPM and then settling back down to \~800. Now it idles around \~650 and doesn't fluctuate significantly. Off topic but my gas mileage went down from \~8 to \~7 L/100km after changing the crank sensor and the spark plugs. Nice!

  
My next steps (in order of doing the easiest shit first) is changing the cam sensor, and then maybe changing the fuel pump + filter assembly. I'm not sold on it being a fuel delivery issue though.

  
What are your thoughts? I am so microscopically close to selling this goddamn car as I've already had to get the lower block replace due to the piston slap issues that they have..

MechanicAdvice,Mechanic sent me off with 2 misfiring cylinders and a quest…,"I was driving my way out of Florida yesterday when my 2000 Chevy Express 2500 5.0L V8 check engine light started blinking and I could feel misfiring. I crawled over to the nearest mechanic a few miles off of I-95 and was lucky that a shop was willing to take me in immediately and help me get back on the road. OBD2 scanner showed 4 misfiring cylinders and their diagnosis was to replace the spark plugs and wires. A few hours and $400 later, 2 cylinders are still misfiring. 

He told me to go to the nearest auto part store, get some Cataclean, continue my trip and run through the rest of my tank like a demon, top off with high octane fuel and Lucas Deep Clean, and my problems will magically resolve. 

I’m in Atlanta now, 500 miles later, still misfiring, and am worried about my catalytic converter. How do y’all feel about this mechanics advice and what should I do now? Misfiring is worse at idling and low speeds, I seem to have an issue with air/fuel ratio (running rich possibly), he mentioned something about the oxygen sensors and fuel injectors on his computer.

MechanicAdvice,Help needed for car rookie,"Hi everyone, a few issues have surfaced with my car the past few days (2013 Ford KA). I first noticed a whistling/screeching noise when driving at speed down the motorway. It’s intermittent and only seems to happen when on fast roads. Then as I was driving home today I was idling in traffic and the whole car started to rumble, it sort of felt like the fan was working overtime. It may have been because I was overly aware but it felt like I was struggling to get my speed up as well as some slight juddering in lower gears. I thought it might be the spark plugs but can’t see how that links to the earlier issue of the screeching noise. 
It has also been SUPER hot this past week so I’m going to get some coolant tomorrow in case the tank is running dry as I thought that might be causing it.

So we have a 2012 Ford Dodge grand caravan with error code P0733 and the only issue is that we lose so nearly all speed going into 3rd gear. There were other codes but we've resolved those.

We've done basically everything but replace the entire transmission, changed the solenoid, opened up the new solenoid since one of the springs inside were stuck and made sure the lil ball thingies were free and even opened up the old solenoid to see there wasn't anything wrong. 

Also went ahead and changed all the sensors and changed the oil multiple times. All the wires were tested and working. We haven't fully taken the transmission out as we currently don't have the space to do that, but this is our next step and would to at least get an idea of what to do/look for once we get to that point.

MechanicAdvice,2002 Grand Prix GTP tranny issue,"Car shifts ok between each gear. But when I get on the highway and I’m cruising between 50-60mph the car wants to get to fourth gear and quickly lower the RPM (overdrive maybe). When I give it a little gas to accelerate to either pass someone or just to keep up with traffic the car wants to buck because there’s load on the transmission, like something is slipping and re-engaging. So I notice that if I want to get faster or accelerate at a greater pace I have to let off the gas, in which the RPMs will slightly increase by a couple hundred. Then I can lean back into the throttle and accelerate as normal. Is this a torque converter or TCC solenoid failure? I have no DTC codes lit up. I haven’t hooked up my scanner to see for any pending codes either. There’s a Trans go shift kit I put in like 7 years ago, which is also the last time I did a pan drop and filter change on the tranny fluid.

MechanicAdvice,Replacing Starter on Jeep Liberty - a beginner activity?,"Hi all, 

Haven't gotten down to my car yet AAA diagnosed my car issue last night as needing a new starter. Only thing though is that I am in an area where the cost is going to be pretty high and I am not doing too hot on my budget this month. My car is a 2009 Jeep Liberty (limited, not sport) and I do have a hobbyist car friend that  offered to lend us any of the tools we would need. 

I found this [video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TblVNXyUIbw)that makes it seem like an easier job than other JL years, especially when moving the drive shaft over to the passenger side instead of removing the complete thing. 

My question here is am I right in thinking that a beginner could do this? I would take my time of course, take lots of photos of how each step looked, etc. But in terms of getting those bolts off the drive shaft, is it as easy as it looks?

MechanicAdvice,2008 Buick Allure CX - worth repairing or giving up?,"Good afternoon! I have a 2008 Buick Allure CX. I have run into an issue with it today and, after looking at the cost of a repair, I'm wondering if it's worth going through with the repair or writing it off and going for a new car. (TLDR at the bottom)

Car context: It's got maybe 260k kilometres on it (160k miles). my dad is a mechanic, so lots of little fixes haven't had much cost to me. The repairs I can remember him doing are that he had to run new power steering lines, my ABS/traction system sensors were replaced, lots of weird brake issues involving the ABS/traction system. 

Aside from what he's done, the repairs I've had are having my driver door handle replaced (it came straight off the door), the locking mechanism in my front passenger door replaced (at which point the mechanic told me this was going to be an issue with the car forever that I'd have to keep getting fixed). My exhaust has failed many times in different places (Canadian), the last of which having my entire resonator and part of my catalytic converter entirely rebuilt for around $700.

 I have had to replace turn signal bulbs more frequently than I'd like - basically yearly if not more often, and I'm not driving like crazy or anything. My brake issue with the ABS has just come back, and my dad lives five hours away so it's not easy to get it fixed. My oil light no longer resets, my seatbelt sensors don't work, the rear passenger door gets stuck open, the whole car is rusty and dented. 

This morning the car didn't start, and talking with a mechanic friend, it sounds like the starter is the issue. The battery is maybe three years old if not less. Lights and radio come on when I turn the key, electronic locks work, car clicks and doesn't turn over when trying to start. I'm going to try and jump it tonight, but if it doesn't start I'll get it towed to the mechanic.

I've called the mechanic and replacing the starter + labour will be $700 at the very least but probably $950, and that's on top of tow costs. Also, if I bring it in now, I think they'll want to fix my brake issue as well ... so it will probably end up being more than $1k.

 In good condition the car is estimated to be worth maybe $2k, but it's not in good condition. I am honestly done with it - I have to drive 5 hours to visit my parents, it's 4 hours to the nearest major city - I don't always trust that the car will last for long drives. It's miserable to drive in the winter which is not great for Canada. I just got a permanent job where I'm making comfortable money. I don't think I'd have any trouble making car payments and I would love a new car with new features that feels reliable. 

My friends - and probably my dad when I talk to him about this - all think that this is probably where I should call it for this car. I just don't know if I'm giving up too easily. I can afford a $1k fix but it would not be a comfortable expense. The car is incredibly hard to repair because it's built in the worst way imaginable and it's hard to get parts. I'm a handy person but the effort required to even replace a headlight was unbelievable. 

TLDR: the car has needed repairs in the last year alone that total over what the car would be worth, some of which are recurring issues. It has 260k kilometres/160k miles. It doesn't feel safe to drive for long distances. I have a new potential repair bill for $900, and I'm in the best spot possible to buy a new (or used?) car. Everyone around me thinks it's in my best interest to call it and just get a new car - which I would be on board for for reliability and new features - but I don't know if I'm giving up on this car too early. I'm just kind of done with it all and don't want to keep sinking money into a car that I don't feel safe driving, but I'm worried this is an impulsive decision.

Any thoughts? Thanks in advance. :)

MechanicAdvice,Ford Ranger steering wheel and pedals locked up while driving,"I drive a 2006 Ford Ranger XLT 3.0L engine. After driving for about an hour, I took a left onto a steep driveway when my wheel suddenly became incredibly difficult to turn and my gas/brakes locked up — as in I couldn’t seem to press down on either of them. After restarting the car three times I was finally able to press the gas for long enough to move my car to a safe parking spot before the problem arose again. I noticed that the check engine, battery, and oil pressure lights all came on at the same time when this happened.

I got the car towed to a nearby mechanics only to be told by them that they took the car for a test drive and it was driving just fine. No warning lights besides an EVAP light (PO457 iirc). I have been avoiding driving the truck too much since then, but today I took it to get alternator and starter testing done. Didn’t have an issue driving and was told that everything looked fine.

Anyone have similar experiences or thoughts about what the issue might be?

Additional context if it’s helpful:

* EVAP light was on the truck when I first bought it (around Sept 2024), I have replaced the gas cap but the light unfortunately returned.
* End of 2024 the fuel gauge suddenly died while I was driving. Took it to a mechanic and got the fuel pump replaced, haven’t had the same issue since then. The EVAP code also went away at the time only to come back about a month or two ago.
* Car has a rough idle.
* A few days before this incident, the check engine light came on only to go away after a day.
* The car occasionally has an issue where I can’t accelerate past a certain speed and it will get all jerky. Issue goes away turning off the car and starting it up again.
* Fluid levels are all good and the car is not due for an oil change.",1,2025-07-11 11:14:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1lxe4fc/ford_ranger_steering_wheel_and_pedals_locked_up/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1lxe4fc/ford_ranger_steering_wheel_and_pedals_locked_up/

 When I’m on the interstate doing 60–70 mph and need to pass someone or climb a hill, it feels like the truck just doesn’t want to go. I end up flooring the gas pedal and it still struggles to accelerate. Same thing when going up mountains—just feels underpowered. I’ve brought this up to two different shops over the years, but both said they couldn’t find anything wrong.

A while back, the original engine locked up and I had a used one swapped in (with about the same mileage). My dad knows the people who did the work, so I don’t think I got they for over on me. But even with the replacement engine, the same issue continues.

Now recently, I noticed a new problem: when I try to fill the tank, the pump cuts off at 3/4. I hadn’t realized it before because I usually just filled about halfway, but now it won’t top off at all.

Could these two issues be connected somehow? Or are they separate problems? Any ideas what could be going on?

MechanicAdvice,What did I do to my car?,"Please try to refrain from bashing me like yesterday. I know I sound like an idiot, but I don’t need to be reminded. A lot of this lacks its actual terminology, but please try to bear with me. Thank you to anyone willing enough to give me some advice!

I spent all day yesterday tinkering with my car. A Honda civic 2006 LX

To start things off, it’s leaking coolant. (Cool, great, I know I need to get it fixed, but it’s hard to find a mechanic that won’t try to scam a young woman out here.)

And it’s also started running hot. That’s where my problem lies.

Well as I said, it’s leaking coolant and I had been “topping it off” to my knowledge. Not knowing that topping it off meant to actually fill it to the brim. (As I said, I am an idiot. I don’t need to be reminded.)

At some point my check engine light came on. Showing codes for my ‘temperature thermostat.’ But eventually turned off.

So with that knowledge and believing I had coolant in my car I figured, “it must obviously be something else.”

So I looked into it, and learned that I could check just by feeling these two pumps and making sure they’re both hot. (Hot-lukewarm, hot-cold, both cold etc.) You probably know what I’m talking about better than I do.

Both pumps were hot.

I’d been using a YouTube video, and the whole time the guy is telling me to watch my hands for the radiator fan located right next to my pumps.

I have two, one being my ac fan and the other my radiator fan. My ac fan would spin, obviously when I turned my ac on, but the other would not.

This is where things get kind of confusing.

So I looked into it, and obviously it could be a number of things. I went with the two easier things. One being checking for a blown fuse and the other being a faulty relay.

I bought a test light. All the fuses were fine.

And then I checked the relays. Switching the ac fan relay and the radiator fan relay.

Lo and behold, the radiator fan starts spinning when the ac is on!

So now I believe I’m getting somewhere, and I take myself up to AutoZone and buy what I believe is the correct piece.

Spoiler alert, it was the wrong piece, but I inevitably decided to try it anyways. (A different relay for a different location. I’m not exactly sure what it’d been for.) don’t ask me why, it all just made sense in my head.

And suddenly both of my fans are spinning, but only with the ac on.

Cars still running hot though, and I’ve been to autozone about 3 different times only to find that they don’t carry the piece that I’m looking for. (Totally fine, I ordered it from Amazon.)

So in conclusion I decided to try again another day. Putting everything back in its original place.

You’d think we’d be coming full circle here. That my ac fan would be running with the ac turned on.

WRONG!! My radiator fan is still spinning when I turn my ac on. >:/

I’ve switched the relays back and forth multiple times.

I looked into it, I rechecked my fuses, and now one of them isn’t lighting up. The 30 amp(?) green one(?) (Don’t ask me.) So I ordered that too.

I have no idea what I did. I’m trying my best here.

My cousin ended up putting coolant in it, and it’s thankfully not running hot. (At the moment.)

Again, I know I need to get the leak fixed. I know that’s my main issue.

But I’m really searching for an explanation on what I did, and why it’s not going back to normal. ",2,2025-07-11 09:51:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1lxbzhh/what_did_i_do_to_my_car/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1lxbzhh/what_did_i_do_to_my_car/
MechanicAdvice,Just bought a 2016 Subaru Legacy and the transmission went. Need to sell ASAP,"Just two months ago I purchased a 2016 Subaru Legacy with around 130k miles for a little over 6 grand, got a pre purchase inspection and everything and was told it just needed new brakes and a few other repairs. It was my first car and was super excited. About 2 weeks ago I was driving it up a hill and a bunch of dash lights popped up including check engine- took it back to my mechanic and was told the error codes ran as a transmission problem and to get rid of/sell the car ASAP. Called Subaru and was told that the code meant no good, and my transmission was most likely shot. I should have known since the cvt transmissions in Subaru's are known to have issues. 

My mechanic wiped the codes so all the dash lights are gone, and was told to drive it very carefully so they don't pop up again. To anyone who'd get in the car, it would appear fine. It's just not worth putting in a whole new transmission for what I paid for the car. Its sitting in my front yard and I need to find a way to get rid of it ASAP before the lights pop up again and it sits undriven any longer. I'd like to try to get the most money back out of it (I know I won't be getting as much as I paid). What should I do?

Only when I accelerate as it tries to start, a problem since new, but was shifting a little harder and I figured hey, maybe they can do an adjustment, like the old days band adjustment or something.

They take the vehicle for a drive. Mechanic reports he cannot replicate any issue. They do a fluid check. And recommend  TRANNY REPLACEMENT for $11,000!

They claim small metal particles on a magnet mean replace.  They show me video and photo that just looks like used fluid. Perfectly working tranny but needs replacement. Huh?  You cannot just change the clutch pack or whatever worn part?

I say hell no. Just change the fluid. They change fluid, truck works like a dream. No hard shifting.  I start to wonder, did they even do the 45,000 mile maintenance I brought it in for at 47K? I had them pull records. It says 45,000 maintenance -BASIC. I do some googling, and I am reading about ""might change fluid if req""! The document shows no 10X $$$ for the fluid or anything. Anyone know what a 45,000 mile -BASIC is for a Silverado 1500? The manual says to replace tranny fluid & filter.   

What do mechanics think of all this? Is it normal to call for a complete replacement based on a fluid check? Would a complete replacement even be the recommended move under any circumstance with a well working transmission?

I have replaced a couple parts in hopes it fixes the issue(and some for maintanence) as per a friends suggestion but to no luck, parts I replaced was:

PCV
PCV elbow and hose
Cleaned and regasketed the iac valve
Cleaned maf sensor
Changed spark plugs
Changed plug wires
New rad cap(was holding no pressure).


Started looking around for vaccum leaks and found one which I'm guessing was the pcv hose which I replaced the clamp on but is still suffering from high fuel trims so now I'm rather stuck as that did deal with the audible vaccum leak but is still having trouble.

Also after those fixes I did try clearing the code two or three days ago which has yet to come back after 27 miles of easy and hard driving but is still asking for 99.2% fuel trim (friend also suggested I take off the negative cable for half hour to see if it has any effect on fuel trim, going to try after I post this), will attach a video I took if it helps and will be curious to hear what you guys think is going on.

This is for my 2017 Ford F-150 Lariat 3.5L Ecoboost which is at 171k miles.

I've always tried to take good care of my vehicle, but now I'm looking at a possible nightmare scenario of having my only vehicle out of commission, while having to wait two weeks before an opening at the transmission shop (with a $120/day rental), before having to probably have my tranmission rebuilt.

I recalled that - 4 years ago - I had taken my vehicle in to Valvoline for an oil change (we were in the process of moving, so I didn't DIY oil changes for a year or two). The guy at Valvoline indicated that, since I was at >80k miles, a transfer case fluid change was recommended. I believed him and accepted the $79.99 charge. 

Since then, I noticed that my truck was overheating on long inclines (not always, just occasionally) and burning through coolant (quite frequently). There are no signs of coolant in my engine oil, and two pressure tests have shown no leaks in my cooling system. I also pre-emptively replaced my thermostat, and have been more recently considering servicing the turbos (I believe it's likely to be a turbo coolant line leak). But I'm starting to wonder if the transfer case fluid replacement might actually be the cause of the overheating?

When I revisited my service records from 2021, it showed that 12 **units** of Valvoline MaxLife Automatic Transmission Fluid were used for the transfer case fluid change. I am aware that my transmission uses Mercon *ULV* and my transfer case fluid uses Mercon *LV*. What puzzled me was that **12 pints** of ATF was applied to my transfer case, which only holds **1.5 qt**, while my transmission holds **13.1 qt** (according to the manual).

I called Valvoline and spoke to the manager and he said that **12 pints** of ATF was used because they flushed the transfer case before filling it, resulting in wastage (i.e.: more units of fluid used than mere filling). I do not believe this to be standard procedure for a transfer case fluid replacement, since a drain-and-fill process seems to be standard.

What I am worried about is that, perhaps, they had drained my transmission and not my transfer case, and then filled it back with **12 qts** of Valvoline MaxLife ATF, which is not Mercon *ULV*\-rated (only Mercon *LV*), resulting in my transmission's gradual death. Throughout this time, I had never received a check engine light, so I was wondering: Is it possible that the incorrect fluid or process was used? Or am I way off base? What can I do at this point? I am open to accepting that, at 171k miles, my transmission has simply reached the end of its lifespan, but wanted to be certain that there isn't something afoul.

I spoke to the service technician at my current service center and he said that, if an incorrect fluid was used, I would've seen issues within weeks, and certainly not 4 years after. Perhaps what has transpired is simply normal wear-and-tear?",1,2025-07-11 08:29:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1lx9voa/transmission_issues_from_incorrect_fluid_2017/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1lx9voa/transmission_issues_from_incorrect_fluid_2017/

MechanicAdvice,2017 Audi A6 - Sudden Complete Coolant Loss (Twice) - No Warning Signs While Driving,"Vehicle: 2017 Audi A6

Issue: This has happened twice now, 2 months apart. I drive normally with no temperature warnings, no low coolant alerts, no performance issues. Park the car, everything seems fine. Next morning I start the car and get a low coolant warning - check the reservoir and it’s completely empty.

Timeline:
	•	First time: Filled reservoir, car ran perfectly for 2 months with stable coolant levels
	•	Second time: Same exact scenario - drove fine, parked overnight, woke up to empty coolant
Key details:
	•	No gradual coolant loss - I check levels regularly and it stays full until suddenly it’s completely gone
	•	No visible puddles under the car
	•	No overheating while driving
	•	No white smoke from exhaust
	•	No performance issues
	•	Coolant loss appears to happen after parking/shutdown, not while driving

What could cause sudden, complete coolant loss overnight with no warning signs during operation? Looking for potential diagnoses before I take it to a shop. The fact that it’s happened twice with the identical pattern has me concerned about a specific failure mode.

Thanks in advance for any insights!",1,2025-07-11 06:58:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1lx7lul/2017_audi_a6_sudden_complete_coolant_loss_twice/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1lx7lul/2017_audi_a6_sudden_complete_coolant_loss_twice/
MechanicAdvice,MINI Strut Mounts (repeat failure),"Hello, I have a 2004 MINI Cooper S JCW. I bought it a few months ago and it needed a total suspension refresh. My shop replaced the front control arm bushings and I replaced all of the original struts with Koni Special Actives, along with new OEM bumpstops, spring pads, strut mounts, etc. 

The strut towers were slightly mushroomed so I hammered them back into shape and installed reinforcement plates on top. Then my shop aligned the car. With less than 50 miles on the new setup, the mounts showed evidence of failure, with the rubber stretching out and the bearing bulging upward. Those were Lemforder mounts (supposedly OEM supplier). 

Long story short, I’ve now tried three sets of mounts (two sets of aftermarket ECS “heavy duty” mounts after the Lemforder failure), new aftermarket springs (stock height) in addition to the original coil springs, and a second set of Koni struts. The result has been the same each time, with the stretched, bulging mounts. The dust caps are starting to push up through the opening of the strut towers. I know I have assembled everything in the correct order and torqued to spec. 

I am also getting a slight vibration through the steering wheel above 60mph, and hearing a “pop” over small bumps, below 20mph - I think mainly from the right side. It sounds more like a metal flexing sound than a clunk. I haven’t gotten a chance to check things like the tie rod ends yet, and have new sway bar end links on order, although I didn’t notice any play last time I had it apart. 

What could I be missing here with these strut mounts? It’s understandable for the rubber to flex upward slightly, and these mounts are known to eventually have a clean break in the rubber around the bearing, but they should not look like this. My last resort is to install all metal camber plates but I question if that’s a bandaid fix for an underlying issue.

MechanicAdvice,Mazda 6 GH (2010) pedal and stereing wheel slight wobble/shaking and squealing when braking,"Hello, I recently started experiencing the mentioned symptoms on my Mazda 6. I took it to a mechanic and they measured rotors and pads and found nothing too weird, almost asked me why am I even here.

I told them to go ahead and replace front pads and rotors (back rotors and pads are newer and definitely in no need of replacement) just to see if things will improve and they marignally have improved, not completely though. Since we didn’t have time to go into detail as I basically filled in a short timeframe in their schedule,  there was no detailed investigation as we determined I’ll monitor what’s happening and decide from there.

What else could cause these issues? Only other thing that comes to my mind are tyres since these are midrange summer tyres which are 4 year old (2 years on the car rotated with winter tyres).  Car otherwise drives great and brakes fine (in terms of braking power).

MechanicAdvice,2017 Volvo S60 T5 Inscription started having trouble with A/C this summer,"Hi all! I have a 2017 Volvo S60 that I love, it drives really nice and the only other major problem I've had since I got it was the music went out but that wasn't a terrible fix (RDAR LOOP). So, the weather started getting into the 80's-90's where I live and of course my AC stops blowing cool air. I took it to my local Volvo dealership because I had my brake pads scheduled there anyway and asked if they could take a look at that as well, they said they did a dye test and found that my condenser has a leak and quoted me $2000 to fix. Out of my budget unless it's an absolute necessity so I took it to my local garage to see if he had any ideas, he claimed that they could not have performed a dye test without recharging the freon which he also claims they did not do, and he said it was a schrader valve that he replaced and recharged my system and charged me $250. About 2 weeks go by and my cool air completely stops again so now I've been driving around just using the fan trying to figure out between my local mechanic what to do, and with my extended warranty (I believe they cover the ac condenser I just have to check in with the dealership). Basically what I'm asking is if anyone has any advice, if some things that I've been told/work that's been done so far doesn't really add up? I'm assuming the warranty would be the best route to go with the dealership, but not sure if I should even bother taking it back to my local mechanic to see what he wants to do next.

MechanicAdvice,2008 Buick Allure CX - worth repairing or giving up?,"Good afternoon! I have a 2008 Buick Allure CX. I have run into an issue with it today and, after looking at the cost of a repair, I'm wondering if it's worth going through with the repair or writing it off and going for a new car. (TLDR at the bottom)

Car context: It's got maybe 260k kilometres on it (160k miles). my dad is a mechanic, so lots of little fixes haven't had much cost to me. The repairs I can remember him doing are that he had to run new power steering lines, my ABS/traction system sensors were replaced, lots of weird brake issues involving the ABS/traction system. 

Aside from what he's done, the repairs I've had are having my driver door handle replaced (it came straight off the door), the locking mechanism in my front passenger door replaced (at which point the mechanic told me this was going to be an issue with the car forever that I'd have to keep getting fixed). My exhaust has failed many times in different places (Canadian), the last of which having my entire resonator and part of my catalytic converter entirely rebuilt for around $700.

 I have had to replace turn signal bulbs more frequently than I'd like - basically yearly if not more often, and I'm not driving like crazy or anything. My brake issue with the ABS has just come back, and my dad lives five hours away so it's not easy to get it fixed. My oil light no longer resets, my seatbelt sensors don't work, the rear passenger door gets stuck open, the whole car is rusty and dented. 

This morning the car didn't start, and talking with a mechanic friend, it sounds like the starter is the issue. The battery is maybe three years old if not less. Lights and radio come on when I turn the key, electronic locks work, car clicks and doesn't turn over when trying to start. I'm going to try and jump it tonight, but if it doesn't start I'll get it towed to the mechanic.

I've called the mechanic and replacing the starter + labour will be $700 at the very least but probably $950, and that's on top of tow costs. Also, if I bring it in now, I think they'll want to fix my brake issue as well ... so it will probably end up being more than $1k.

 In good condition the car is estimated to be worth maybe $2k, but it's not in good condition. I am honestly done with it - I have to drive 5 hours to visit my parents, it's 4 hours to the nearest major city - I don't always trust that the car will last for long drives. It's miserable to drive in the winter which is not great for Canada. I just got a permanent job where I'm making comfortable money. I don't think I'd have any trouble making car payments and I would love a new car with new features that feels reliable. 

My friends - and probably my dad when I talk to him about this - all think that this is probably where I should call it for this car. I just don't know if I'm giving up too easily. I can afford a $1k fix but it would not be a comfortable expense. The car is incredibly hard to repair because it's built in the worst way imaginable and it's hard to get parts. I'm a handy person but the effort required to even replace a headlight was unbelievable. 

TLDR: the car has needed repairs in the last year alone that total over what the car would be worth, some of which are recurring issues. It has 260k kilometres/160k miles. It doesn't feel safe to drive for long distances. I have a new potential repair bill for $900, and I'm in the best spot possible to buy a new (or used?) car. Everyone around me thinks it's in my best interest to call it and just get a new car - which I would be on board for for reliability and new features - but I don't know if I'm giving up on this car too early. I'm just kind of done with it all and don't want to keep sinking money into a car that I don't feel safe driving, but I'm worried this is an impulsive decision.

Any thoughts? Thanks in advance. :)

MechanicAdvice,Water in the passenger footwell!,"Hello everyone! I don’t usually post on Reddit, but I think i need some personalized help here. I have a 2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i with ~59,000 miles on it. Whenever I turn the AC on in the car, a TON of water leaks out from under the dashboard on the passenger side. It works fine for about 5 minutes, but then something in there makes a sort of whirring/squeaking/choking(?) noise before the leaking starts. I am not quite sure what to do or where to start, but I included a video of the leakage in action. The air is still cold, and it still blows the air well, but it creates a faucet down below that is soaking my carpet!

Something is definitely wrong with the AC, but I’ve never fixed a car myself beyond changing the oil, so I am a bit lost on what exactly is wrong and what I need to do to fix it.

As far as what I’ve tried already: I tried to get the AC evaporator hose off because a quick google search said to check that for any blockages first, but I can’t seem to get it off on the side that connects to the evaporator. When I pulled it out through the hole in the firewall (where it exits the car to drip onto the road) some water came out of that bottom end while i was finagling it around. If water is coming out of that hose, surely there isn’t a blockage, right? I tried for a solid half hour to detach the hose at the top, lubricated it and everything, but it won’t budge.

Normally I would just ask my dad for help, but he is old and sick and I want to get good at figuring these things out by myself for when he isn’t here anymore. He would also likely tell me not to bother fixing it because running the AC is a frivolous waste of gas, but I just bought this car in April and I’ll be damned if I can’t get my money’s worth on all the features!!

Do you think something needs to be replaced, or is there a blockage somewhere that needs to be unclogged? I am not sure where to even start on this. Any advice would be appreciated, and I’d be happy to answer any clarifying questions.

MechanicAdvice,2010 VW Electrical Problem,"I’m having issues with my 2010 Volkswagen Jetta 2.5L MFI DOHC 5cyl, sometimes it won’t start at all, and I get the battery light on the dash. I’ve already replaced the battery, and my current solution is disconnecting the battery for like 15-20 minutes, reconnecting it and then it starts. I can’t really find the cause of the issue, most of the time it happens when i’ve idled the car for a bit, other times I think it’s because the A/C is on max setting for a prolonged period of time, but I haven’t found the exact thing causing the issue. Does anyone know how I can locate the exact issue? or if it’s a common issue that I can quickly fix?

MechanicAdvice,2003 Silverado - Loss of Power at Speed &  Can’t Fill Past 3/4 Tank,"I’ve got a 2003 Chevy Silverado 4.3L that’s been acting up for a few years now. It sat unused for a while—only really got driven in the summer for lake trips—but even before that, I started noticing something off.

 When I’m on the interstate doing 60–70 mph and need to pass someone or climb a hill, it feels like the truck just doesn’t want to go. I end up flooring the gas pedal and it still struggles to accelerate. Same thing when going up mountains—just feels underpowered. I’ve brought this up to two different shops over the years, but both said they couldn’t find anything wrong.

A while back, the original engine locked up and I had a used one swapped in (with about the same mileage). My dad knows the people who did the work, so I don’t think I got they for over on me. But even with the replacement engine, the same issue continues.

Now recently, I noticed a new problem: when I try to fill the tank, the pump cuts off at 3/4. I hadn’t realized it before because I usually just filled about halfway, but now it won’t top off at all.

Could these two issues be connected somehow? Or are they separate problems? Any ideas what could be going on?

MechanicAdvice,What did I do to my car?,"Please try to refrain from bashing me like yesterday. I know I sound like an idiot, but I don’t need to be reminded. A lot of this lacks its actual terminology, but please try to bear with me. Thank you to anyone willing enough to give me some advice!

I spent all day yesterday tinkering with my car. A Honda civic 2006 LX

To start things off, it’s leaking coolant. (Cool, great, I know I need to get it fixed, but it’s hard to find a mechanic that won’t try to scam a young woman out here.)

And it’s also started running hot. That’s where my problem lies.

Well as I said, it’s leaking coolant and I had been “topping it off” to my knowledge. Not knowing that topping it off meant to actually fill it to the brim. (As I said, I am an idiot. I don’t need to be reminded.)

At some point my check engine light came on. Showing codes for my ‘temperature thermostat.’ But eventually turned off.

So with that knowledge and believing I had coolant in my car I figured, “it must obviously be something else.”

So I looked into it, and learned that I could check just by feeling these two pumps and making sure they’re both hot. (Hot-lukewarm, hot-cold, both cold etc.) You probably know what I’m talking about better than I do.

Both pumps were hot.

I’d been using a YouTube video, and the whole time the guy is telling me to watch my hands for the radiator fan located right next to my pumps.

I have two, one being my ac fan and the other my radiator fan. My ac fan would spin, obviously when I turned my ac on, but the other would not.

This is where things get kind of confusing.

So I looked into it, and obviously it could be a number of things. I went with the two easier things. One being checking for a blown fuse and the other being a faulty relay.

I bought a test light. All the fuses were fine.

And then I checked the relays. Switching the ac fan relay and the radiator fan relay.

Lo and behold, the radiator fan starts spinning when the ac is on!

So now I believe I’m getting somewhere, and I take myself up to AutoZone and buy what I believe is the correct piece.

Spoiler alert, it was the wrong piece, but I inevitably decided to try it anyways. (A different relay for a different location. I’m not exactly sure what it’d been for.) don’t ask me why, it all just made sense in my head.

And suddenly both of my fans are spinning, but only with the ac on.

Cars still running hot though, and I’ve been to autozone about 3 different times only to find that they don’t carry the piece that I’m looking for. (Totally fine, I ordered it from Amazon.)

So in conclusion I decided to try again another day. Putting everything back in its original place.

You’d think we’d be coming full circle here. That my ac fan would be running with the ac turned on.

WRONG!! My radiator fan is still spinning when I turn my ac on. >:/

I’ve switched the relays back and forth multiple times.

I looked into it, I rechecked my fuses, and now one of them isn’t lighting up. The 30 amp(?) green one(?) (Don’t ask me.) So I ordered that too.

I have no idea what I did. I’m trying my best here.

My cousin ended up putting coolant in it, and it’s thankfully not running hot. (At the moment.)

Again, I know I need to get the leak fixed. I know that’s my main issue.

But I’m really searching for an explanation on what I did, and why it’s not going back to normal. ",2,2025-07-11 09:51:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1lxbzhh/what_did_i_do_to_my_car/,https://www.reddit.com/r/MechanicAdvice/comments/1lxbzhh/what_did_i_do_to_my_car/
MechanicAdvice,2012 honda civic LX not starting after replacing battery.,"so my civic started throwing up a bunch a codes, ABS, VSA, PS, BRAKE, etc. figured it was the battery because i knew it needed to be replaced, so i replaced it. it started after replacing it and was still coding when driven after so i assume the alternator, but now it won’t start again. i’m still assuming alternator since battery looks like it’s not being charged, but i’m gonna try to diagnose once i’m home from work. would love any advice or insight on it, i have a warranty but im not sure how much they’d charge for an alternator.
