Icon Question
So didn’t see this exact icon in the manual. Could have missed it in the 400+ pages. The 12V battery icon looks different in the manual but ChatGPT thinks that is what it is. I did a hard reset and it went away.  But now worried the 12V is going bad (Rivian proactively replaced it in May after 18 months of having no issues).  Thoughts?"

Tire replacement. Issues at Costco.
I’m at about 14K miles on the factory Pirelli 22"" tires on my R1S, and they’re already due for replacement, which I know isn’t surprising, since many of us have experienced how short-lived these OEM tires can be.

Today, I got a quote from America's Tire for a set of Michelin Defenders (22""), which seem to be the most commonly recommended replacement in this group. While I was at Costco, I figured I’d swing by their tire center to see if they’d beat the quote, since America’s Tire mentioned they offer price matching.

But Costco told me they couldn’t install the Michelin Defenders because my door jam label specifies ""HL"" for Heavy Load, meaning I’m limited to tires like the Pirellis that meet that rating.

Has anyone else run into this issue? Were you able to find a workaround or an alternative HL-rated tire?"

Tesla charger issues?

Vibration and humming noise from the front end
I have a late 2022 R1T (11/22 build date) with 37k miles. Rivian SC replaced my front axles and hubs/bearings about a month ago. When I picked it up I started hearing a hollow humming noise from my front end (feels like front left wheel). I've had them look at it last week and they said everything is fine and that it must be my ""aftermarket"" tires (brand new 21"" Michelin Defenders). They seem to be unwilling to diagnose it further unless I put Pirellis back on there. It's mostly noticeable at high speeds but now that I've tuned into it I hear it at lower speed as well. Jumping on the freeway today it has gotten louder, I'll try and record a video clip.

Has anybody had an issue like this before?"

Left side Prox Sensors
I have recently been getting the left side prox sensor going off every time I make a left turn at low speed. This wasn’t an issue till recently, maybe after the last update. Happens at about 15mph or less with about half left steer to full left steer. Video to detail. Anyone else have this issue and a solution. Or is this bug in the software. I have washed the truck 3 times and it continues to happen dirty or clean. It’s absolutely annoying.

DC to Austin: Days 2 and 3
Day 1 DC to Knoxville:
https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/s/2JNwYhttux

Day 2: Knoxville to Bryant, AK
We stayed over night in downtown Knoxville which was great. A public parking lot down the street from our hotel offered free L2 charging and parking over night was only $2! The best charging deal we saw the whole trip.

Chargers are plentiful in TN, but thin out a lot in AK. We hit Tesla superchargers at the Crossville, TN Bucc-ee’s and the Casey Jones Museum in Jacksonville, TN. Both worked fine (Crossville had reports of broken Superchargers on PlugShare?), but we went a little rogue parking. We also hit up a charger in Nashville in a parking garage near Party Fowl when we went for lunch. The charger was fine, but the parking lot company (Park Happy LLC) uses text to pay and it didn’t work so we got hit with an $80 parking violation. Their website has a prominent link to dispute parking violation fines, so I’m guessing this is a common issue. I certainly didn’t park happy.

Day 3: Bryant, AK to Austin, TX
We intended to charge overnight at the hotel in Bryant, which we picked because it had chargers. This was a mistake. The hotel chargers are from StaynCharge, which is total garbage. StaynCharge required an app (ugh) and preloading $$ (double ugh). The cost per kWH was outrageous ($0.65–triple ugh). Even though I set up auto load and auto load took more of my money twice, the car stopped charging after my original money limit was hit after only 2 hours of charging (UGHHHH). So we woke up to a mostly uncharged car. Only positive is that the app has an option to refund the auto loaded money.

Luckily, we’d kept the charge high through TN (knowing AK was a bit of a dead zone), so we had enough charge to get somewhere with a functioning charger. But it added time to our trip we’d hoped to avoid.

Once we hit Texarkana, things got better. We stopped in Dallas for a late lunch at the White Rock Alehouse & Brewery (be sure to try Dave’s Perfect Pils) then tried to charge up before hitting the road, but had to skip the first charger because it was full. We scooted down the road to a Tesla supercharger. We also hit up the Bucc-ee’s in temple to was the bugs off before arriving in Austin. It did better than expected LOL, though some bugs remain.

Overall, not too bad. I had a bit of charge anxiety about AK, but our style of stopping frequently (and charging whenever we stopped) worked well.

Can we talk about route planning in the app?
So I have a longer trip coming up and I decide to use the app so i can decide on a realistic departure SOC... and somehow the app says that I can travel 112 miles, while only losing 88 miles of range (with no charging stop, checked twice). 

Sooo.. I send the trip to the truck, and it has added a charging stop and when i remove the charge stop to mafch what the app says, I show an arrival range that is a full 31 miles less than what the app says. 

Now, coming from Tesla, I expect (and have seen) software issues, but is it too much to expect the app to be able to do basic arithmetic? "

Dog Mode Availability
I’m not trying to generate a contentious debate here about the use of dog mode. However, I am curious to know if there is a reason more EV manufacturers don’t offer a dog mode similar to Tesla and Rivian? We have a Mercedes Benz EQE SUV and have to use a hack to keep climate control on. It works but not nearly as convenient or reliable actual dog mode. Mercedes Benz software engineers seemingly lied when telling its customer base that dog mode would be implemented in 2025, but now claim they will not offer it. I assume dog mode can’t be a regulatory issue in the U.S. given the availability in Tesla and Rivian. "

This is mostly directed to WI EV owners, but feel free to share if your state has a similar issue
I started a petition to ask WI lawmakers to reduce the registration fee for EVs. Although I understand that the state needs the taxes associated with fuel to cover road maintenance and stuff, I feel that charging an EV owner 3x as much a regular vehicle owner is punitive and does not encourage EV ownership. If your state has different policies, feel free to share it here as it could give good ideas to WI legislators. Thank you all.

My Mercedes C300, 2015, Sedan 4 Matic, Sport Trim, recently encountered the P0299 Check Engine Code (Need Genuine Opinions)
My Mercedes C300, 2015 has had the turbo replaced and the CCV kit replaced as well. The turbo itself is under warranty. The car has 294,000KMS on engine. Yes, it’s old, but whatever. 

Moreover, randomly the car will drive fine then if I try to push it harder by accelerating hard on runways, it will enter limp mode without a check engine light. The one time the check engine light did come on, I reset the code. If I turn car off then back on and drive it, it’ll have power again as if it’s fine, however, moment I get aggressive with the gas throttle, it tends to enter limp mode without a check engine light always coming on. I never replaced my boost pressure sensor. I noticed my CCV kit when the mechanic installed has broken the rubber piece inside it, so a buddy of mine tried to seal it for me and used strong adhesive, would this be the issue? I attached the image. 

Any help goes a long way. I do plan on getting it diagnosed professionally, just want to see if anyone has any advice cause most mechanics seem to contradict each other and have no real clue what’s really happening. 

Changed:
-Brand new Mercedes Turbo with manufacture warranty on turbo it self not installation cause got installed at private mechanic shop. 
-Brand new CCV kit. 


Curious:
-why car runs fine most times but when I go into sport plus mode and aggressively accelerate it enters that limp mode stage, and the car loses a lot of power as if no more turbo. 
-car is tuned and has an ECU Stage 2 Tune with careless Armytrix down pipe. 

Thanks all for your advice and feedback in advance!

VW Polo Mk5 2012 (UK) parking sensor issue
Had this car for 5 and a half years and this is the first time this has happened. Having an issue where the right sensor automatically comes on (max level) when I’m driving or when I’m parked, even though there’s nothing next to me.

Not sure if it’s the front right sensors or the rear right sensors.

It happened randomly 4/5 hours after I got my car washed 6 days ago, and is still happening. It happens at random times. I have to turn my car off then on again for it to stop, then it will happen randomly again. Or sometimes it just stops without me turning my car off, and will then come back on again randomly.

You can see on the dashboard where the sensor indicators are, the left one is on level 1 with an amber colour, but the right one is on max level with flashing red lights.

I’ve wiped all of the sensors with a cloth.

My car doesn’t have a parking sensor off/mute button.

This is what it says in the car handbook:
“Switching the parking distance warning system on and off
• Switching on: Select reverse gear while the ignition is switched on.
• Switching off: Drive forwards faster than approximately 15 km/h (6 - 9 mph).”

I’m driving forwards faster than 10mph and it stays on.

Any ideas?! Thanks."

Nissan Maxima 2010. AC / POWER STEERING TROUBLE
Hey guys. 

Bought a used Nissan Maxima 2010 recently. 
Got it services and oil checked after buying. Mechanic indicated no major faults. The AC wasn't 100% so had it looked at. 
First long trip abt 200km (2 days after buying),car reached destination without issues, but soon after started having a belt slipping kind of noise (originating somewhere around the left wheel area). The sound was present whenever I turned on the car and would soon go away. 
But after 3 or 4 times (short trips, inside residential area, 1 to 2 kms) the power steering turned off, the sound became permanent and the AC started blowing hot air. 

What do you think can be the issue? 
Power steering is no longer working, all fluids are present in the right amount, tyre pressure is okay. I'm scared of turning it on now. 
All help appreciated.

Edit: The sound sounded like a belt malfunctioning, some Google searching indicated it might be something called a serpentine belt or a related pulley, which may be a shared component. What do you guys think? "

My car is sounding normal and then it just has this weird noise all of a sudden on a off. It comes and goes on its own but I do know that it’s speed dependent. If assume it’s not a belt related issue because of it being a speed dependent issue. It doesn’t change with the rpm’s or when I’m taking turns. It also goes away whenever I’m going maybe less than 20 mph. It just gets worse\faster when I’m going faster.

Please help tail light issue!
2006 Kia Spectra – Right Tail Light Keeps Going Out (Electrical Issue?)

I’ve got a 2006 Kia Spectra with about 87k miles. It’s in solid shape overall, but I’ve been dealing with a really frustrating electrical issue. The right tail light keeps going out shortly after it’s replaced.

I’ve taken it to the shop three times. One mechanic said the electrical harness might be going bad — but apparently they don’t make a replacement for this model anymore. Another said it could be my spoiler light pulling too much power, so they disconnected that. But even after that, the tail light keeps going out.

I’m worried about driving around with a light out, but I can’t afford a bunch of pricey electrical work or constant repairs. The car runs fine otherwise, and I’d really like to keep it going without sinking a bunch of money into it.

Is there anything else I should check? Are there workarounds for an old harness like this? Any advice would be really appreciated. I just want a fix that’ll last.

2004 F150 | 5.4L Triton
My truck has been messed up. It is a 2004 F150 Lariat King Ranch Edition RWD with a 5.4 L Triton engine (I know, these things have issues) with 220k miles.
  
Si far, I have replaced the spark plugs, starter, fuel injectors, ignition coils, fuel filter, fuel pump, MAF sensor, O2 sensors, and smoke tested for any leaks. It has codes for system being too rich and too lean. I have recently had worse issues with it.  
  
Today I had a new issue. You can hear the noise in the video, the entire truck shakes while it does that. I was pulsing the gass in the video so it could be heard better. It barely wants to go from 0-20 and puts off an awful smell when doing so, I dont recognize the smell as I have never had a vehicle this messed up. The low oil pressure warning occasionally kicks on. The truck shut off two times today. I was on my way to my brother's house and the battery light came on and engine shut off. I just started it back and there was no issue. When leaving, I came to a turn and it shut off while I was turning and I did the same thing. I droce it home and just didn't stop for anything and it made it back. I dont really want to start it again without any guidance, as I am not really sure what is wrong.  
  
I can replace things and do fine with mechanic work, but I only know a lot about the things that I have already done. My next plans were to change the cam sensors and egr valve. If that does nothing then I'll bite the bullet and replace the timing chain.  
  
Guidance would be much appreciated. Would I be best off selling the hunk of junk and trying to buy something new? It obviously wont sell for a lot and I can't afford anything that isn’t going to have problems, so I dont want to fully reset since I have already done some work on it.

2017 Cadillac Escalade Steering Issue
Looking for some help with my 2017 Cadillac Escalade. I’m on my fourth trip to the local dealer and they cannot rectify the issue.

The vehicle steering pulls and does not return to center. They have done four alignments on the vehicle and still not rectify it.

I truly believe this is not a mechanical issue and more an issue with the electric power steering. I have attached a video of my scanner showing they delivered torque value from the steering control module. Turning the vehicle to the right everything seems OK but when I turn the vehicle to the left, the value skyrockets past the expected range. My local Cadillac dealer says this is perfectly normal, which I somehow can’t believe.

I have tested the battery along with insured connections, and grounds are tight. My last resort would be replacing the power steering rack.

Hello,

My father has a 2003 Toyota Sienna. Awhile ago the ABS and tir e pressure sensor light came on. He recently took the car to a mechanic and they tried to change a sensor on one of the wheels but that didn't make any difference so they put the old one back on. They told him their computer says the car is going 60mph while the car was in park and he needs to take it to a dealer to get looked at since they didn't know how to fix that.

2005 Honda CRV vibrates when in drive with foot on break
I hit a pothole on my passenger side pretty hard, ever since thin my car has been vibrating while in drive with my foot on the break, not constantly but usually comes up at least once every drive. It only happens in drive with foot on the break, not neutral not reverse

When I originally spoke to a mechanic over the phone they said to take it to Les Schwab first because it most likely has something to do with the suspension or wheel since that's where the impact came from, but they said they was no visible damage or anything wrong with the car from that standpoint (Les Schwab I know)

I then pop the hood and see when I switch gears the engine moves forward and backwards - ChatGPT says this is from a passenger side engine mount failure. I take it to a mechanic and they said they inspected and ""the DRIVER side mount is moving the most"" I'm extremely confused here because all signs point to the passenger side mount (car hit impact, forward backward engine movement) could the problem really be the driver side mount? I'm worried they will get me to pay for it, it won't solve the issue then I end up paying for the next mount....

Need advice on 2011 Equinox LT 2.4 ecotech, exhaust manifold.
Long story short my muffler rusted and had to be replaced.  Shop told me that he thinks the manifold is broken but he is unsure if it is the cat and the manifold since he was looking from the vantage point of the muffler.  Vehicle does have oil consumption issues because, Equinox.  I am not a mechanically inclined per say, but can follow step by step instructions.  It is possible that the hubby and I could buy the manifold and tools that we don't have and manage based off the video that I have seen but would take us a couple of days likely to do.  We do still have a loan on the vehicle, which I plan on having paid off within a year or less, so I figure we have 3 options:

Opt 1-  Try changing it out ourselves.  It looks straight forward but time consuming.  We have been mostly successful at various simple jobs like MAF sensor, solenoids, and PCV stuff on cars and lawn mowers.

Opt 2- Call around and find the best price, eat the 400 to 500 labor cost and hope it isn't the cat as well as.  I don't plan on sinking 4 grand into a car worth 5,000.

  
Opt 3- Not fix it and plunk the money down on the loan to pay it off faster, hope that it doesn't croak beforehand.   

We are planning to get another vehicle once this one is paid, (I am sticking to Toyota and Honda and hell with low mileage) and will just run this one until it dies either way and then scrap it.  Not trading that crappy engine in to be sold to another person.  I would just like to be in a better spot financially before we do.   What is my best option?  Roughly how long have I got?"

Choke light and stall out
I have an 82 Firebird TransAm MSE with a 305 carburetor. After driving on the highway and coming to a complete stop my choke like comes on and I stall out. Is this a problem with my fuel pump? Or could this just be a tuning issue? I originally thought my fuel lines were dirty so I used one of the fuel cleaners and it was ok for a day or two, and after that back to stalling out. "

ISSUE – Seat Ibiza 1.2 TDI 2011 – Glow Plug Light Flashing, Power Loss, Occasional Check Engine Light
Hey everyone,
I’m having an ongoing and very annoying issue with my Seat Ibiza 1.2 TDI from 2011 (3-cylinder diesel engine).

Here’s what’s happening:
	•	While driving, the glow plug light starts flashing intermittently
	•	When it happens, the car loses power, starts vibrating, and feels like it’s struggling
	•	Sometimes, the Check Engine Light (CEL) also comes on, but it turns off by itself after restarting the engine a couple of times

Strange part:
	•	If I turn the car off and back on, the issue disappears temporarily
	•	Sometimes it doesn’t happen for weeks, then suddenly it’s back again
	•	The CEL only shows up occasionally, and doesn’t always stay on

What I’ve done so far:
	•	I’ve cleaned the fuel tank (I thought it could be sediment or dirty diesel)
	•	No ECU tuning or modifications
	•	I always fuel up at decent stations

I’ve read it could be:
	•	A DPF (FAP) issue
	•	A bad or clogged EGR valve
	•	A faulty brake pedal sensor (heard this causes flashing glow plug lights on VAG cars)
	•	Or maybe a failing injector

I haven’t done a proper VCDS or OBD scan yet, but I plan to soon.
Has anyone experienced something similar with this engine?
Any idea where I should start looking or what error codes to expect?

Any help would be much appreciated. 🙏

Has my brand new starter motor kicked the bucket?
Starter motor was getting very tired/ slow on a car that im working on/ trying to get going (Audi Q7, 3.0TDI).   
Replaced with a new starter motor, which turned over fast at first, then started to get tired like the battery was going flat - thing is the battery is new (fully charged) and even with jump cables connected to another car started to barely crank the car. I removed the glow plugs (to make sure it wasn't hydrolocking with fuel) and barely made a difference, even with glow plugs out.  
Now, It barely cranks the car, even though you can turn the car over by hand (with a socket and breaker bar). It also used to crank for ages, but now only does about 2 slow revolutions and gives up. 

I put a multimeter on battery, and the crank voltage drops to 10-11v.   
I then put multimeter on engine ground and starter solenoid contact, and another test to the main positive cable, and volt drops to the same, 10-11v when cranking, which should be more than enough?  
  
Which tells me it has to be the starter motor right?  
I have also lost contact with ECU through OBD and the car seems to have a multitude of electrical issues, but if the start motor is getting full voltage, the crank issue has to be with the starter, right?  


Thanks in advance for any replies"

Is it my battery or my alternator
I drive a 2014 jeep Cherokee latitude. I don’t know much about cars. On my way home my battery light came on. My voltage on the dashboard was below ten.

Alternator issues?? Need help
Hi, I know absolutely nothing about cars and really need some help figuring this out.

I bought a 2013 Dodge Journey from a family friend not too long ago. Ever since i got it, I have had an issue where if i don’t drive my car for a day, the battery will die. I never had any lights show on my dash.

I took it to the mechanic and they told me it was an issue with the alternator and replaced it.
when i went to pick my car up from the mechanic, my car felt more jittery then normal. about 15 minutes into my drive home, my battery light came on. 

I took it for a drive a couple hours later to make sure it was driving ok. Shortly after I started the car I got a message saying something along the lines of “Park Assist System”. I didn’t make it far before both speedometers stopped telling me how fast i was going, my ac stopped working (would turn on and off repeatedly blowing hot air), my windows wouldn’t roll down, and my screen controlling my climate, radio, etc turned off. My car also sounded louder than normal.

Does anyone have any ideas on what the issue could be? I’m going to attempt to take it back in on monday, but i’d like to be prepared on what might be wrong. Thank you so much!"

2013 Honda Civic EX EPS Issues
Hi all first time reddit user and post.

I'm not a professional mechanic but dangerous, so most repairs I can handle in my own garage. 

I have a 2013 Honda Civic EX 1.8L with an EPS failure (by that I mean it's very difficult to steer and I have the EPS light on in the dash). 
 
Troubleshooting I've done includes checking the motor side and module side wiring for wear, corrosion, etc. with no findings. Battery connections are good with no corrosio. Note that the battery is new within the last 2 months.  Battery holds approx. 12 volts with the car off. Battery reads 13.07v at idle under load (lights, rear defroster, AC, etc.) and a.voltage drop off the alternator of 0.21v. 

I don't want to sink money on an alternator or new module without additional advice so I'm here in reddit. I'm also open to other troubleshooting steps.to help identify the root cause and part that needs replaced. 

Thanks in advance!"

Far from knowledgeable, is this serious?
Hi,

I recently started to hear a sort of clicking/chittering when turning. Had a look to see if anything was obvious to see this (Google says tie rod?) leaking fluid from a tear in the black rubber!

I'll be taking it to an mechanic as soon as possible, but given we're going into a weekend and then I'd have to get a time it could be a week or so before it's fixed.

Is it something serious to the extent the car shouldn't be driven? I rely really heavily on it but I drive my kids in this and don't want to put them in danger if it's a serious, do not drive this, sort of issue.

As I'm sure if obvious I'm all but clueless about this and paranoia is setting in!

I’m not sure what else to do or how to fix this issue
I drive a 2015 Hyundai Elantra and the car for the most part runs just fine especially on freeways but if it’s stopped(usually at intersections or red lights) it’ll stall and then the car won’t move even if I press the brake and gas so I have to turn the entire car off and restart it then when it turns car on it’ll start shaking and even when I press the gas it’ll barely run until I pull over and give it time to reset. 
The car also “breaks down” at random times and is unpredictable when it’ll do it
More info if needed: when the car is stalled the check engine light, battery warning light, and the engine oil warning light turns on. But when I restart the car all of the lights turn off. The check engine stayed on longer other day but then eventually turned off a couple hours later. 
I’ve taken it to oreillys for a battery and engine light test and they both came up with good signs. I’ve also taken the car to two different mechanics who ran diagnostics on the car but both found nothing wrong with it. There was a recall on the car but I have also taken it to the dealership to get it fixed. 
Like the title says I’m not sure what else to do and where else to take especially since it is seemingly fine. "

Bad Torque Converter or Transmission?
1999 Honda Accord EX 3.0 

I purchased this vehicle for cheap from a friend, and for the past year, they experienced ongoing transmission issues. While driving, the car jerks and struggles to shift smoothly. More recently, I’ve noticed a loud clunk when shifting into any gear with the brake applied (automatic transmission). The impact is sometimes severe enough to stall the engine.

Additionally, there's a noticeable 1 to 1.5-second delay between selecting a gear and the transmission engaging. During this delay, I can hear a grinding sound, somewhat similar to lightly pressing metal against a bench grinder.

Transmission fluid appears to be in good condition with no burnt smell. I'm currently having difficulty sourcing a used transmission, and I'm wondering if this could be an issue with the torque converter instead.

Any insight or guidance would be greatly appreciated. Thank you in advance for your help"

Steering rack - what should I expect in terms of work and cost?
My 2005 Scion xB (manual) has been making an ugly noise when I turn sharply to the right (does not happen to the left). Took it to my mechanic who said it was an issue with the steering rack. My mechanic doesn’t do those services, so he referred me to Les Schwab.

Mechanic didn’t give me a lot of details so I don’t know exactly what’s wrong with the rack, if it needs replacement vs. repair, or which component(s) would need repair. I worry that if I go in not knowing much I may get upsold and spend more money than necessary, or at the very least I’ll not be prepared for the cost.

Can anyone offer info regarding what I should expect here? Does my description of the problem help at all in figuring out what repairs I might need or what kind of cost I’m looking at? Aside from the noise, there is no stiffness or uneven steering behavior."

Town and county '05 3.8L
I have a town and country and it was misfiring in cylinder 2 (p0302) and was also showing code (p0135).
I put in a new Delco upstream O2 sensor (xzz) and changed ignition wires and the coil pack as well as changing the spark plug on cylinder 2. ( Did all of this while out of town and then drove 300 miles back home with no issues.)

I am not getting both lean and Rich codes(p0171 & p0172) as well as the p0406. 

Could this just mean a bad erg valve? Could it cause a all 3 codes...or could these codes indirectly be related to the O2 sensor? I know that sometimes you can unfortunately get a dud but I am just at a loss.

Blown Motor or Bad CPS?
2015 ram ecodiesel 3.0

About a month ago, I went to pass someone, truck revved high 3500-4500 rpm’s I passed them with ease then quickly lost all power. Motor was still idling but wouldn’t rev. I coasted to a flat spot off the road and and shut the truck off. While waiting for the tow I started it again, it started but idled very rough, I gave it some throttle it barely moved and sounded awful. I shut it off and had it towed. 

Next day I try to start it, cranked normally but no start. I’ve let it sit now about a month, went out and just for fun went to start it, barely cracks now. Got a brand new battery, same thing cranks exactly 2 revolutions then stops. 

Only dtc code it’s throwing is P061C-00. 

With this information is it likely a blown motor or the cps sensor? 

I’m willing to pull trans and change sensor/ring but want to know if there’s a definitive way to tell if it’s the sensor or motor is trashed. I’ve read they’re bad about cracks going bad, worried this is my issue. "

2006 Pontiac Grand Prix GXP, 5.3L LS4 - Intermittent Start/Stall Led to Deep Dive - Found No Bank 2 Fuel Trim, ETC Issues. Need Help! Usually able to fix simple stuff myself but after hours in the garage I am begging for mercy.
Hey everyone, seeking guidance from the community on r/MechanicAdvice! My 2006 Pontiac Grand Prix GXP with the 5.3L LS4 is having intermittent start-and-stall issues. Sometimes it starts and runs correctly. Other times, it cranks, catches briefly, and stalls immediately unless the throttle is used. An OBD-II scanner was used for diagnostics.

Diagnostic Data:

1. **Bank 2 Fuel Trims:** Missing Data
   * No data is received for Bank 2 fuel trims (STFT2 and LTFT2) when monitoring live data. The scanner displays them as a dash that does not change through a drive cycle, although the engine seems to be running on Bank 2 (no noticeable misfires), the computer provides no feedback for it.
2. **Bank 1 Fuel Trims: Negative LTFT**
   * LTFT1: \[-10%\]
   * STFT1: \[0%\] (at idle)
   * I found a hole in the intake boot while trying to diagnose this, and assumed I had solved the issue, but I know a lean condition from a vacuum leak should cause positive fuel trims as the computer adds to compensate. The negative LTFT suggests a rich condition on Bank 1.
3. **Throttle Position Discrepancy**
   * A discrepancy between the ""Commanded Throttle Position"" and the ""Actual Throttle Position"" PIDs on the scanner. With the ignition on (engine off), slowly depressing the accelerator pedal shows the ""Actual"" not smoothly or immediately tracking the ""Commanded."" It sometimes lags or is slightly off. I cleaned the throttle body, but it didn't solve this either.

My goal is to fix this with the tools I have. Featuring my mom's cameraman skills."

Any guesses on what the problem could be?
Howdy y’all. A few months ago I purchased a 2016 Hyundai Veloster R-spec with a 1.6l 4cyl engine sitting at 76k miles. I know, I should have done my research before buying a Hyundai, it was my first time buying a car and what’s done is done. 
Recently I went on a trip out of town, and after about 90 minutes of driving, as I was on the highway my AC cut off. I didn’t know this was a warning sign and kept driving, and 15 minutes later the car wouldn’t get any gas. It shifted gears fine, but the rpms dropped to zero and it wouldn’t accelerate. I had to roll off the highway, and once I stopped the car it turned off and wouldn’t turn back on. The lights come on but the car makes a kind of wheezing/whirring noise.
This issue came out of nowhere, when I bought the car there was proper maintenance history and no damage, and I have only put 2,600 additional miles on the vehicle. My check engine light did turn on about a month ago, but the DTC was P0299 and at the time I couldn’t spend any money on resolving it.
I got the car towed to a mechanic who said my engine is “completely burnt up and in need of replacement. They quoted me a minimum 8k (not including labor) for a used engine with 90k miles. This is extremely suspicious to me and I will be visiting another mechanic for a second opinion, but I thought I would see if anyone has a clue about what this could mean before I pay for another tow.

ABS and VSC on 07 Camry!!
ok reddit i need your help!!

i drive a 2007 Camry xle, its in pretty good condition, no accidents, new battery,  relatively new breaks and sparks, clean v6 engine at only 100k miles. and its been **pretty much** fine accept earlier today. 

after idling for maybe 5 mins i turned my car off and sat there for a another 5 or so, and then tried to start my car to leave and it barely cranked but no flip, all the dash lights came on for a second and then just the abs and vsc light stayed on and the warning screen said "" check vsc system"" . its and push to start if that helps at all. the ac got a little louder before i turned the car off but i didn't think it was concerning. i tried a second time and the breaks got stiff. so i called for a jump and it was fine after that. its done this and something similar twice before. 

once a little less than 2 and a half months ago, i was dropping my sister off and same thing i sat in the parking lot for a second, probably only 1 or 2 mins and then turned the car off. then when i went to start it it cranked for a second and then died, same lights came on. i tried a second time that time as well, the dash flickered on and off like it didn't even have enough power for that, or just couldn't fully turn the lights on and then died. i jumped it, started fine, lights went off, i tested the battery at it was just over 12v, and thats all she wrote.

  
until about two weeks ago. i was driving my mom and we pulled off on the side of the road for directions. same thing. i sat there for about 2 mins but this time i only got a ding, like your seatbelt ding, but only once. i looked at the dash and didn't see anything, then 30 seconds maybe a minuet later same ding and the vsc light just flashed, maybe 5-10 seconds if that then the light disappeared. it did it 2 more times while we were figuring out what to do and then we just headed home. no issues driving or anything, i think we had the ac on again but neither of us remember. after that no issue until today.

  
my abs and vsc systems work fine, ive recently had to slam my breaks and i felt the abs kick on. all my fluids are good, oil is still good, gas cap clicks and is tight, temps and rpm are fine. haven't checked the fuses or any of my censors but nothing else has trouble. i really have no idea what it could be.

2013 Elantra GL 1.8L: Crank with no start when hot
Yay! More Elantra issues!

I have a 2013 Elantra 1.8L (126XXX km)  that within the last two weeks has taken to the following:

1. On a cold start, it will crank, start, then immediately the engine cuts out (stalls?). This is intermittent. Usually when it happens, it will crank, fire, and start as normal on the second go.
2. On a warm-hot start (ie, drive for 15-20+min, then stop the engine and restart) it will crank and crank and crank and crank and not fire. If I let the engine sit for 5-10 minutes, it'll usually fire up fine again.

  
I have scoured the web for causes, and so far I have changed the spark plugs (unrelated, but I was going to do them anyway) and changed the crankshaft position sensor. Once I changed the crank sensor, the problem went away for a couple days and now it's back.

My thoughts: We're getting air, fuel, and spark. When I turn the key to acc, I can hear the buzz of the fuel pump priming. When it is cranking and not firing, I tried turning the key on and off of acc to prime the fuel pump further, but that did not help. Spark, well, I just changed the plugs. Air, I just cleaned out the engine air filter and noticed some carbon around the throttle body, so cleaning that is on my to-do, but I don't suspect that it's causing this. When the car runs, there's no hesitation or lag; I can redline it fine and it never seems to hesitate as though it was starved for one of the three. This said, I think it may be a synchronization issue between engine and computer (ie, crank / cam sensor is borked therefore computer is not letting the injectors fire because it thinks the cam isn't clocked correctly?)

  
After changing the crank sensor, it idles a lot better - it would 'hiccup' (?) when warm and idling, going from \~800 to \~1200 RPM and then settling back down to \~800. Now it idles around \~650 and doesn't fluctuate significantly. Off topic but my gas mileage went down from \~8 to \~7 L/100km after changing the crank sensor and the spark plugs. Nice!

  
My next steps (in order of doing the easiest shit first) is changing the cam sensor, and then maybe changing the fuel pump + filter assembly. I'm not sold on it being a fuel delivery issue though.

  
What are your thoughts? I am so microscopically close to selling this goddamn car as I've already had to get the lower block replace due to the piston slap issues that they have..

Hyundai Tucson 2021- Brake Pads
Hello Experts!

I am at 58k miles on my hyundai tucson 2021. And perfectly no issues as of  now but whenever I go to brake plus or Midas or any other corporate chain store, they intend me to change the Brake pads & Rotors and gives me a quote of $1200 bucks. So I have decided to change them myself.

Im shopping on Rockauto for brakepads but I only find front pads from Akebono but the rear are not available. Is it still ok to get front pads from Akebono and Rear pads from Bosch? Would that be ok or is it recommended to be from same brand for both axles?"

Mechanic sent me off with 2 misfiring cylinders and a quest…
I was driving my way out of Florida yesterday when my 2000 Chevy Express 2500 5.0L V8 check engine light started blinking and I could feel misfiring. I crawled over to the nearest mechanic a few miles off of I-95 and was lucky that a shop was willing to take me in immediately and help me get back on the road. OBD2 scanner showed 4 misfiring cylinders and their diagnosis was to replace the spark plugs and wires. A few hours and $400 later, 2 cylinders are still misfiring. 

He told me to go to the nearest auto part store, get some Cataclean, continue my trip and run through the rest of my tank like a demon, top off with high octane fuel and Lucas Deep Clean, and my problems will magically resolve. 

I’m in Atlanta now, 500 miles later, still misfiring, and am worried about my catalytic converter. How do y’all feel about this mechanics advice and what should I do now? Misfiring is worse at idling and low speeds, I seem to have an issue with air/fuel ratio (running rich possibly), he mentioned something about the oxygen sensors and fuel injectors on his computer. I’m supposed to be in Ohio by Wednesday and it’s now the weekend… thanks"

Help needed for car rookie
Hi everyone, a few issues have surfaced with my car the past few days (2013 Ford KA). I first noticed a whistling/screeching noise when driving at speed down the motorway. It’s intermittent and only seems to happen when on fast roads. Then as I was driving home today I was idling in traffic and the whole car started to rumble, it sort of felt like the fan was working overtime. It may have been because I was overly aware but it felt like I was struggling to get my speed up as well as some slight juddering in lower gears. I thought it might be the spark plugs but can’t see how that links to the earlier issue of the screeching noise. 
It has also been SUPER hot this past week so I’m going to get some coolant tomorrow in case the tank is running dry as I thought that might be causing it. 
If anyone has any ideas it would be super appreciated, I guess I’ll try and get to a mechanic next week but know it will be hard to diagnose without any warning lights! "

Is it possible for a strut to be un fixable?
My 2013 Chevy impala LTZ driver rear strut broke. I took it to a mechanic and they said it’s completely broken and the area it attaches to the car is rusted out. I asked if they could fix it and they told me it was unfixable. I’ve never heard of a strut being unfixable and that because of the broken strut I shouldn’t drive it. I should also note that they do sell vehicles there as well. Is this issue truly not fixable or were they just trying to freak me out to get me to possible buy one of their vehicles?"

At my wit's end with this 62te
So to preface, this is a project I'm helping with, and it's been going on for a bit longer than expected. So we have a 2012 Ford Dodge grand caravan with error code P0733 and the only issue is that we lose so nearly all speed going into 3rd gear. There were other codes but we've resolved those.

We've done basically everything but replace the entire transmission, changed the solenoid, opened up the new solenoid since one of the springs inside were stuck and made sure the lil ball thingies were free and even opened up the old solenoid to see there wasn't anything wrong. 

Also went ahead and changed all the sensors and changed the oil multiple times. All the wires were tested and working. We haven't fully taken the transmission out as we currently don't have the space to do that, but this is our next step and would to at least get an idea of what to do/look for once we get to that point. (I honestly want to just cut our losses, but not my choice to make.) If it turns out we need a new transmission, that'll be the straw that broke the camel's back n we finally get rid of this car lol."

2002 Grand Prix GTP tranny issue
Car shifts ok between each gear. But when I get on the highway and I’m cruising between 50-60mph the car wants to get to fourth gear and quickly lower the RPM (overdrive maybe). When I give it a little gas to accelerate to either pass someone or just to keep up with traffic the car wants to buck because there’s load on the transmission, like something is slipping and re-engaging. So I notice that if I want to get faster or accelerate at a greater pace I have to let off the gas, in which the RPMs will slightly increase by a couple hundred. Then I can lean back into the throttle and accelerate as normal. Is this a torque converter or TCC solenoid failure? I have no DTC codes lit up. I haven’t hooked up my scanner to see for any pending codes either. There’s a Trans go shift kit I put in like 7 years ago, which is also the last time I did a pan drop and filter change on the tranny fluid.

I was reading on the Triple Edge performance website about the 4T65E trannies and common problems and none of them explain what I’m experiencing. 

Thanks in advance for any help. "

Replacing Starter on Jeep Liberty - a beginner activity?
Hi all, 

Haven't gotten down to my car yet AAA diagnosed my car issue last night as needing a new starter. Only thing though is that I am in an area where the cost is going to be pretty high and I am not doing too hot on my budget this month. My car is a 2009 Jeep Liberty (limited, not sport) and I do have a hobbyist car friend that  offered to lend us any of the tools we would need. 

I found this [video ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=TblVNXyUIbw)that makes it seem like an easier job than other JL years, especially when moving the drive shaft over to the passenger side instead of removing the complete thing. 

My question here is am I right in thinking that a beginner could do this? I would take my time of course, take lots of photos of how each step looked, etc. But in terms of getting those bolts off the drive shaft, is it as easy as it looks? Any advice on getting everything back together? Are there questions that I might not be asking myself that would be helpful in this project (whether helping me get it done or giving me info on why not to do it). "

2008 Buick Allure CX - worth repairing or giving up?
Good afternoon! I have a 2008 Buick Allure CX. I have run into an issue with it today and, after looking at the cost of a repair, I'm wondering if it's worth going through with the repair or writing it off and going for a new car. (TLDR at the bottom)

Car context: It's got maybe 260k kilometres on it (160k miles). my dad is a mechanic, so lots of little fixes haven't had much cost to me. The repairs I can remember him doing are that he had to run new power steering lines, my ABS/traction system sensors were replaced, lots of weird brake issues involving the ABS/traction system. 

Aside from what he's done, the repairs I've had are having my driver door handle replaced (it came straight off the door), the locking mechanism in my front passenger door replaced (at which point the mechanic told me this was going to be an issue with the car forever that I'd have to keep getting fixed). My exhaust has failed many times in different places (Canadian), the last of which having my entire resonator and part of my catalytic converter entirely rebuilt for around $700.

 I have had to replace turn signal bulbs more frequently than I'd like - basically yearly if not more often, and I'm not driving like crazy or anything. My brake issue with the ABS has just come back, and my dad lives five hours away so it's not easy to get it fixed. My oil light no longer resets, my seatbelt sensors don't work, the rear passenger door gets stuck open, the whole car is rusty and dented. 

This morning the car didn't start, and talking with a mechanic friend, it sounds like the starter is the issue. The battery is maybe three years old if not less. Lights and radio come on when I turn the key, electronic locks work, car clicks and doesn't turn over when trying to start. I'm going to try and jump it tonight, but if it doesn't start I'll get it towed to the mechanic.

I've called the mechanic and replacing the starter + labour will be $700 at the very least but probably $950, and that's on top of tow costs. Also, if I bring it in now, I think they'll want to fix my brake issue as well ... so it will probably end up being more than $1k.

 In good condition the car is estimated to be worth maybe $2k, but it's not in good condition. I am honestly done with it - I have to drive 5 hours to visit my parents, it's 4 hours to the nearest major city - I don't always trust that the car will last for long drives. It's miserable to drive in the winter which is not great for Canada. I just got a permanent job where I'm making comfortable money. I don't think I'd have any trouble making car payments and I would love a new car with new features that feels reliable. 

My friends - and probably my dad when I talk to him about this - all think that this is probably where I should call it for this car. I just don't know if I'm giving up too easily. I can afford a $1k fix but it would not be a comfortable expense. The car is incredibly hard to repair because it's built in the worst way imaginable and it's hard to get parts. I'm a handy person but the effort required to even replace a headlight was unbelievable. 

TLDR: the car has needed repairs in the last year alone that total over what the car would be worth, some of which are recurring issues. It has 260k kilometres/160k miles. It doesn't feel safe to drive for long distances. I have a new potential repair bill for $900, and I'm in the best spot possible to buy a new (or used?) car. Everyone around me thinks it's in my best interest to call it and just get a new car - which I would be on board for for reliability and new features - but I don't know if I'm giving up on this car too early. I'm just kind of done with it all and don't want to keep sinking money into a car that I don't feel safe driving, but I'm worried this is an impulsive decision.

Any thoughts? Thanks in advance. :)

Anyone know what this sound could be?
Hey guys,
I’m having an issue with my car and I’m not sure what’s going on. In the video, you can hear a weird sound, kind of like it’s sucking air or liquid, or maybe struggling to pull fuel — honestly, I’m not sure.

The car turns on, but that sound stays on the whole time it’s running.

Ford Ranger steering wheel and pedals locked up while driving
I drive a 2006 Ford Ranger XLT 3.0L engine. After driving for about an hour, I took a left onto a steep driveway when my wheel suddenly became incredibly difficult to turn and my gas/brakes locked up — as in I couldn’t seem to press down on either of them. After restarting the car three times I was finally able to press the gas for long enough to move my car to a safe parking spot before the problem arose again. I noticed that the check engine, battery, and oil pressure lights all came on at the same time when this happened.

I got the car towed to a nearby mechanics only to be told by them that they took the car for a test drive and it was driving just fine. No warning lights besides an EVAP light (PO457 iirc). I have been avoiding driving the truck too much since then, but today I took it to get alternator and starter testing done. Didn’t have an issue driving and was told that everything looked fine.

Anyone have similar experiences or thoughts about what the issue might be?

Additional context if it’s helpful:

* EVAP light was on the truck when I first bought it (around Sept 2024), I have replaced the gas cap but the light unfortunately returned.
* End of 2024 the fuel gauge suddenly died while I was driving. Took it to a mechanic and got the fuel pump replaced, haven’t had the same issue since then. The EVAP code also went away at the time only to come back about a month or two ago.
* Car has a rough idle.
* A few days before this incident, the check engine light came on only to go away after a day.
* The car occasionally has an issue where I can’t accelerate past a certain speed and it will get all jerky. Issue goes away turning off the car and starting it up again.
* Fluid levels are all good and the car is not due for an oil change."

Oil cooler?
Dumb question but I have a first Gen Honda pilot. Yea the ones with the horrific transmission issues. 

My curiosity makes me ask. So the solution or the generally accepted one is a oil cooler. Does the transmission die due to heat itself or the oil cooking and turning into something else? As in assuming I just used like AMS OIL atf or something, changed it every oil change. Every 7500 would this basically be the same as having a oil cooler? Or would this be even superior to that?

Like how does heat actually kill a transmission? Assuming it's not so much heat it turns to slag?"

2003 Silverado - Loss of Power at Speed &  Can’t Fill Past 3/4 Tank
I’ve got a 2003 Chevy Silverado 4.3L that’s been acting up for a few years now. It sat unused for a while—only really got driven in the summer for lake trips—but even before that, I started noticing something off.

 When I’m on the interstate doing 60–70 mph and need to pass someone or climb a hill, it feels like the truck just doesn’t want to go. I end up flooring the gas pedal and it still struggles to accelerate. Same thing when going up mountains—just feels underpowered. I’ve brought this up to two different shops over the years, but both said they couldn’t find anything wrong.

A while back, the original engine locked up and I had a used one swapped in (with about the same mileage). My dad knows the people who did the work, so I don’t think I got they for over on me. But even with the replacement engine, the same issue continues.

Now recently, I noticed a new problem: when I try to fill the tank, the pump cuts off at 3/4. I hadn’t realized it before because I usually just filled about halfway, but now it won’t top off at all.

Could these two issues be connected somehow? Or are they separate problems? Any ideas what could be going on?

Broken spark plug
Hey guys, 

So I've got a 2015 Nissan Altima with a 2.5L and I've got 2 issues.

The engine is leaking oil somewhere and it eventually drops onto the accessory belt which then sprays it everywhere making it very hard to trace. My intuition is telling me head gasket, valve cover seal, or timing cover seal 

While inspecting everything tough I had a spark sheer off right below the hex. The plug threads are still fully engaged and I assume heavily rusted, and at the bottom of a tube making easy access impossible. Do I have any promising options or an I looking at removing the head and accessing it from the other side?

Kia sportage 2015 awd- power window
Hey everyone,

I have a 2015 Kia Sportage, and I’m having trouble with the power windows. The passenger-side front window is currently rolled down and won’t go back up. The switch on the passenger side works but only for rolling down, and the driver-side master switch can only roll the window down—not up.

Before this issue, I didn’t notice any unusual sounds or electrical issues. Also, the rear windows work fine when using the switches in the back seats, but they won’t roll up when I try to control them from the driver’s switch.

Does anyone have an idea of what might be causing this? I'm hoping it’s something I can fix myself before taking it to a mechanic.

Undiagnosed low and rough idle only when warm, EGR valve recently replaced but same check engine code
Basically the title. My mechanic doesn’t know what the issue is, and car had no issues when they test drove it. 

6 months ago while on a trip out of town we nearly got stranded as the car had troubles starting, had to give lots of gas to get it going. Shop diagnosed an EGR valve issue. Got that part replaced.

Last week, while on a similar trip out of town, car refuses to start, tried gassing it, nothing. Then on the fourth try just barely got it to start up. Car threatened to stall on me the whole way home at every red light (rpm’s would drop to 800 and the whole car would shake). Check engine light on. 

Of course, next day the car is acting perfectly for the shop guys. Weirdly the code was for the EGR valve again. But they test drove each day for 5 days and no issue. They cleared the code and are giving it back to me.

What did I do to my car?
Please try to refrain from bashing me like yesterday. I know I sound like an idiot, but I don’t need to be reminded. A lot of this lacks its actual terminology, but please try to bear with me. Thank you to anyone willing enough to give me some advice!

I spent all day yesterday tinkering with my car. A Honda civic 2006 LX

To start things off, it’s leaking coolant. (Cool, great, I know I need to get it fixed, but it’s hard to find a mechanic that won’t try to scam a young woman out here.)

And it’s also started running hot. That’s where my problem lies.

Well as I said, it’s leaking coolant and I had been “topping it off” to my knowledge. Not knowing that topping it off meant to actually fill it to the brim. (As I said, I am an idiot. I don’t need to be reminded.)

At some point my check engine light came on. Showing codes for my ‘temperature thermostat.’ But eventually turned off.

So with that knowledge and believing I had coolant in my car I figured, “it must obviously be something else.”

So I looked into it, and learned that I could check just by feeling these two pumps and making sure they’re both hot. (Hot-lukewarm, hot-cold, both cold etc.) You probably know what I’m talking about better than I do.

Both pumps were hot.

I’d been using a YouTube video, and the whole time the guy is telling me to watch my hands for the radiator fan located right next to my pumps.

I have two, one being my ac fan and the other my radiator fan. My ac fan would spin, obviously when I turned my ac on, but the other would not.

This is where things get kind of confusing.

So I looked into it, and obviously it could be a number of things. I went with the two easier things. One being checking for a blown fuse and the other being a faulty relay.

I bought a test light. All the fuses were fine.

And then I checked the relays. Switching the ac fan relay and the radiator fan relay.

Lo and behold, the radiator fan starts spinning when the ac is on!

So now I believe I’m getting somewhere, and I take myself up to AutoZone and buy what I believe is the correct piece.

Spoiler alert, it was the wrong piece, but I inevitably decided to try it anyways. (A different relay for a different location. I’m not exactly sure what it’d been for.) don’t ask me why, it all just made sense in my head.

And suddenly both of my fans are spinning, but only with the ac on.

Cars still running hot though, and I’ve been to autozone about 3 different times only to find that they don’t carry the piece that I’m looking for. (Totally fine, I ordered it from Amazon.)

So in conclusion I decided to try again another day. Putting everything back in its original place.

You’d think we’d be coming full circle here. That my ac fan would be running with the ac turned on.

WRONG!! My radiator fan is still spinning when I turn my ac on. >:/

I’ve switched the relays back and forth multiple times.

I looked into it, I rechecked my fuses, and now one of them isn’t lighting up. The 30 amp(?) green one(?) (Don’t ask me.) So I ordered that too.

I have no idea what I did. I’m trying my best here.

My cousin ended up putting coolant in it, and it’s thankfully not running hot. (At the moment.)

Again, I know I need to get the leak fixed. I know that’s my main issue.

But I’m really searching for an explanation on what I did, and why it’s not going back to normal. "

Just bought a 2016 Subaru Legacy and the transmission went. Need to sell ASAP
Just two months ago I purchased a 2016 Subaru Legacy with around 130k miles for a little over 6 grand, got a pre purchase inspection and everything and was told it just needed new brakes and a few other repairs. It was my first car and was super excited. About 2 weeks ago I was driving it up a hill and a bunch of dash lights popped up including check engine- took it back to my mechanic and was told the error codes ran as a transmission problem and to get rid of/sell the car ASAP. Called Subaru and was told that the code meant no good, and my transmission was most likely shot. I should have known since the cvt transmissions in Subaru's are known to have issues. 

My mechanic wiped the codes so all the dash lights are gone, and was told to drive it very carefully so they don't pop up again. To anyone who'd get in the car, it would appear fine. It's just not worth putting in a whole new transmission for what I paid for the car. Its sitting in my front yard and I need to find a way to get rid of it ASAP before the lights pop up again and it sits undriven any longer. I'd like to try to get the most money back out of it (I know I won't be getting as much as I paid). What should I do?

2003 Honda Odyssey rear doors/hatch auto lock unless a front door is open, how do I disable or fix?
My 2003 Honda Odyssey EX-L has the standard security/alarm system. For the past year and a half, when unlocked with the key fob (different fobs have been used, confirmed not a fob issue) the car will lock itself again within about a minute. If either sliding door or the rear hatch are open, it will still lock, then the alarm will go off once closed. Keys have been locked inside the car numerous times because of this, leaving the alarm blaring.
The only thing that stops it from auto-locking is opening one of the front doors. The front doors can be closed again and it will stop it from auto locking.
This has been incredibly frustrating when running to the car to grab something out of the back and not getting it closed back up in time.

Is there a way to disable the auto locking, or fix whatever is not recognizing that sliding doors or rear hatch are open?"

2018 Silverado. Chevy recommends tranny replacement! No issues!
I took my 2018 Silverado 1500 LTZ 70,800 miles, in for a checkup because the hard shift from auto stop seemed to be getting a little worse.  Only when I accelerate as it tries to start, a problem since new, but was shifting a little harder and I figured hey, maybe they can do an adjustment, like the old days band adjustment or something.

They take the vehicle for a drive. Mechanic reports he cannot replicate any issue. They do a fluid check. And recommend  TRANNY REPLACEMENT for $11,000!

They claim small metal particles on a magnet mean replace.  They show me video and photo that just looks like used fluid. Perfectly working tranny but needs replacement. Huh?  You cannot just change the clutch pack or whatever worn part?

I say hell no. Just change the fluid. They change fluid, truck works like a dream. No hard shifting.  I start to wonder, did they even do the 45,000 mile maintenance I brought it in for at 47K? I had them pull records. It says 45,000 maintenance -BASIC. I do some googling, and I am reading about ""might change fluid if req""! The document shows no 10X $$$ for the fluid or anything. Anyone know what a 45,000 mile -BASIC is for a Silverado 1500? The manual says to replace tranny fluid & filter.   

What do mechanics think of all this? Is it normal to call for a complete replacement based on a fluid check? Would a complete replacement even be the recommended move under any circumstance with a well working transmission?

P0171 Lean code, STFT B1S2 99.2%
Decided to come to you guys to see if you can make heads or tails of my current situation, posted it on the FEOA forums(ford escort owners association) but with no luck yet:

For starters my car is a '98 ford escort ZX2 with the 2.0 DOHC I4 that I got last month and was enjoying till it started having issues sticking at 3000rpm but hasn't done since, but the current issues at hand instead trying to fix that is a P0171 code and the B1S2 STFT being 99.2% while also feeling like its stumbling at idle if you turn off the ac which I use to just keep the rpm's up at 900-1200 but if you don't it will sit at 700 before eventually dipping lower and lower until it dies.

I have replaced a couple parts in hopes it fixes the issue(and some for maintanence) as per a friends suggestion but to no luck, parts I replaced was:

PCV
PCV elbow and hose
Cleaned and regasketed the iac valve
Cleaned maf sensor
Changed spark plugs
Changed plug wires
New rad cap(was holding no pressure).


Started looking around for vaccum leaks and found one which I'm guessing was the pcv hose which I replaced the clamp on but is still suffering from high fuel trims so now I'm rather stuck as that did deal with the audible vaccum leak but is still having trouble.

Also after those fixes I did try clearing the code two or three days ago which has yet to come back after 27 miles of easy and hard driving but is still asking for 99.2% fuel trim (friend also suggested I take off the negative cable for half hour to see if it has any effect on fuel trim, going to try after I post this), will attach a video I took if it helps and will be curious to hear what you guys think is going on. Thanks."

Transmission Issues from Incorrect Fluid? - 2017 Ford F-150 Lariat 3.5L Ecoboost - 171k Miles
Hello! I am looking for some advice from y'all. I recently started finding that my transmission was slipping during gear changes, and it rapidly turned into revving without acceleration, while I was on the road. I managed to limp to a service shop nearby, where I was told that I would have to take my truck into a transmission shop for servicing because the transmission oil (while still full, smelled burned/awful). This is for my 2017 Ford F-150 Lariat 3.5L Ecoboost which is at 171k miles.

I've always tried to take good care of my vehicle, but now I'm looking at a possible nightmare scenario of having my only vehicle out of commission, while having to wait two weeks before an opening at the transmission shop (with a $120/day rental), before having to probably have my tranmission rebuilt.

I recalled that - 4 years ago - I had taken my vehicle in to Valvoline for an oil change (we were in the process of moving, so I didn't DIY oil changes for a year or two). The guy at Valvoline indicated that, since I was at >80k miles, a transfer case fluid change was recommended. I believed him and accepted the $79.99 charge. 

Since then, I noticed that my truck was overheating on long inclines (not always, just occasionally) and burning through coolant (quite frequently). There are no signs of coolant in my engine oil, and two pressure tests have shown no leaks in my cooling system. I also pre-emptively replaced my thermostat, and have been more recently considering servicing the turbos (I believe it's likely to be a turbo coolant line leak). But I'm starting to wonder if the transfer case fluid replacement might actually be the cause of the overheating?

When I revisited my service records from 2021, it showed that 12 **units** of Valvoline MaxLife Automatic Transmission Fluid were used for the transfer case fluid change. I am aware that my transmission uses Mercon *ULV* and my transfer case fluid uses Mercon *LV*. What puzzled me was that **12 pints** of ATF was applied to my transfer case, which only holds **1.5 qt**, while my transmission holds **13.1 qt** (according to the manual).

I called Valvoline and spoke to the manager and he said that **12 pints** of ATF was used because they flushed the transfer case before filling it, resulting in wastage (i.e.: more units of fluid used than mere filling). I do not believe this to be standard procedure for a transfer case fluid replacement, since a drain-and-fill process seems to be standard.

What I am worried about is that, perhaps, they had drained my transmission and not my transfer case, and then filled it back with **12 qts** of Valvoline MaxLife ATF, which is not Mercon *ULV*\-rated (only Mercon *LV*), resulting in my transmission's gradual death. Throughout this time, I had never received a check engine light, so I was wondering: Is it possible that the incorrect fluid or process was used? Or am I way off base? What can I do at this point? I am open to accepting that, at 171k miles, my transmission has simply reached the end of its lifespan, but wanted to be certain that there isn't something afoul.

I spoke to the service technician at my current service center and he said that, if an incorrect fluid was used, I would've seen issues within weeks, and certainly not 4 years after. Perhaps what has transpired is simply normal wear-and-tear?"

Based Off These Pics, What Do You Think Is Leaking?
2004 Hyundai Sonata, 4 cylinder. Noticed oil (or what appears to be oil) accumulated and saturated on the passenger side of my engine bay while I was changing out my spark plugs and ignition coils. 

My valve cover gasket is still in good shape, and the leak appears to be coming from one of these pipes/hoses on the side. With all the build-up, I couldn't distinguish the source. 

I haven't had any issues driving her lately. And I cleaned off the build-up to the best of my ability after taking these (especially off of that wire at the bottom).

2017 Audi A6 - Sudden Complete Coolant Loss (Twice) - No Warning Signs While Driving
Vehicle: 2017 Audi A6

Issue: This has happened twice now, 2 months apart. I drive normally with no temperature warnings, no low coolant alerts, no performance issues. Park the car, everything seems fine. Next morning I start the car and get a low coolant warning - check the reservoir and it’s completely empty.

Timeline:
	•	First time: Filled reservoir, car ran perfectly for 2 months with stable coolant levels
	•	Second time: Same exact scenario - drove fine, parked overnight, woke up to empty coolant
Key details:
	•	No gradual coolant loss - I check levels regularly and it stays full until suddenly it’s completely gone
	•	No visible puddles under the car
	•	No overheating while driving
	•	No white smoke from exhaust
	•	No performance issues
	•	Coolant loss appears to happen after parking/shutdown, not while driving

What could cause sudden, complete coolant loss overnight with no warning signs during operation? Looking for potential diagnoses before I take it to a shop. The fact that it’s happened twice with the identical pattern has me concerned about a specific failure mode.

Thanks in advance for any insights!"

MINI Strut Mounts (repeat failure)
Hello, I have a 2004 MINI Cooper S JCW. I bought it a few months ago and it needed a total suspension refresh. My shop replaced the front control arm bushings and I replaced all of the original struts with Koni Special Actives, along with new OEM bumpstops, spring pads, strut mounts, etc. 

The strut towers were slightly mushroomed so I hammered them back into shape and installed reinforcement plates on top. Then my shop aligned the car. With less than 50 miles on the new setup, the mounts showed evidence of failure, with the rubber stretching out and the bearing bulging upward. Those were Lemforder mounts (supposedly OEM supplier). 

Long story short, I’ve now tried three sets of mounts (two sets of aftermarket ECS “heavy duty” mounts after the Lemforder failure), new aftermarket springs (stock height) in addition to the original coil springs, and a second set of Koni struts. The result has been the same each time, with the stretched, bulging mounts. The dust caps are starting to push up through the opening of the strut towers. I know I have assembled everything in the correct order and torqued to spec. 

I am also getting a slight vibration through the steering wheel above 60mph, and hearing a “pop” over small bumps, below 20mph - I think mainly from the right side. It sounds more like a metal flexing sound than a clunk. I haven’t gotten a chance to check things like the tie rod ends yet, and have new sway bar end links on order, although I didn’t notice any play last time I had it apart. 

What could I be missing here with these strut mounts? It’s understandable for the rubber to flex upward slightly, and these mounts are known to eventually have a clean break in the rubber around the bearing, but they should not look like this. My last resort is to install all metal camber plates but I question if that’s a bandaid fix for an underlying issue. "

Mazda 6 GH (2010) pedal and stereing wheel slight wobble/shaking and squealing when braking
Hello, I recently started experiencing the mentioned symptoms on my Mazda 6. I took it to a mechanic and they measured rotors and pads and found nothing too weird, almost asked me why am I even here.

I told them to go ahead and replace front pads and rotors (back rotors and pads are newer and definitely in no need of replacement) just to see if things will improve and they marignally have improved, not completely though. Since we didn’t have time to go into detail as I basically filled in a short timeframe in their schedule,  there was no detailed investigation as we determined I’ll monitor what’s happening and decide from there.

What else could cause these issues? Only other thing that comes to my mind are tyres since these are midrange summer tyres which are 4 year old (2 years on the car rotated with winter tyres).  Car otherwise drives great and brakes fine (in terms of braking power).

Any and all advices and recommendations are appreciated.

2017 Volvo S60 T5 Inscription started having trouble with A/C this summer
Hi all! I have a 2017 Volvo S60 that I love, it drives really nice and the only other major problem I've had since I got it was the music went out but that wasn't a terrible fix (RDAR LOOP). So, the weather started getting into the 80's-90's where I live and of course my AC stops blowing cool air. I took it to my local Volvo dealership because I had my brake pads scheduled there anyway and asked if they could take a look at that as well, they said they did a dye test and found that my condenser has a leak and quoted me $2000 to fix. Out of my budget unless it's an absolute necessity so I took it to my local garage to see if he had any ideas, he claimed that they could not have performed a dye test without recharging the freon which he also claims they did not do, and he said it was a schrader valve that he replaced and recharged my system and charged me $250. About 2 weeks go by and my cool air completely stops again so now I've been driving around just using the fan trying to figure out between my local mechanic what to do, and with my extended warranty (I believe they cover the ac condenser I just have to check in with the dealership). Basically what I'm asking is if anyone has any advice, if some things that I've been told/work that's been done so far doesn't really add up? I'm assuming the warranty would be the best route to go with the dealership, but not sure if I should even bother taking it back to my local mechanic to see what he wants to do next. Thank you for any advice, this has been driving me insane and I have trouble knowing who to fully trust and who's trying to take advantage of me, albeit a bit overtly cautious."

1999 Hyundai Sonata 2.5 EPFGW G6BV V6 engine
I drove 90 km from seller home i parked it outside then i started it up again and moved the car inside, in the morning when i was supposed to go take a picture of it, it didnt start, (crank motor cranks, gas pump works because i untightened the commonrail and turned key over and it spilled gas, i checked one plug it was alright, air filter is new i also checked all fuses and changed two burnt out ones under the steering wheel next to the pedals, i charged the battery and tried to start with the charger on as well,) HOWEVER unlike the night before, in the morning when it started and ran for approx 2-3 seconds before it died the guages didnt move at all and thats not usual i hear the engine combust fuel but the guages dont show the engine spinning, its day 2 now, I spent day one trying to unplug clean and replug all the different cables i could access in the engine bay. The car almost always starts running for like a second or two before it gets cut by something. The day i was driving it home it was raining but no unusual noises could be heard and it always started up first try without any delay which lead me to assume its one of two things either the immobilizer wasnt coded with the reserve key which the original owner never used and therefore the car somehow just locked up and now doesnt even wanna start with the original key or the rpm sensor got bitten though by an animal at midnight and so now the ecu kills the engine cuz it doesnt know rpms, PLEASE HELP ME god or anyone else PLEASEE i bought it drove 90 km from the seller home and no problems, it waited over night and now it doesnt run for more than 2 seconds ( sometimes a little more sometimes a little less ) depends on which key i use, M-Masterkey doesnt let it run for as long as the S-Secondary key which the original owner always used. I dont know what to do im 18 and my parents told me dont buy old car its gonna have problems, but i never expected it to have problems this fast or this instantly...[Video of starting with S - Secondary key](https://youtu.be/Duq0WmlvZwA?si=Id2uBTb8tjR7hPuM)"

2008 Buick Allure CX - worth repairing or giving up?
Good afternoon! I have a 2008 Buick Allure CX. I have run into an issue with it today and, after looking at the cost of a repair, I'm wondering if it's worth going through with the repair or writing it off and going for a new car. (TLDR at the bottom)

Car context: It's got maybe 260k kilometres on it (160k miles). my dad is a mechanic, so lots of little fixes haven't had much cost to me. The repairs I can remember him doing are that he had to run new power steering lines, my ABS/traction system sensors were replaced, lots of weird brake issues involving the ABS/traction system. 

Aside from what he's done, the repairs I've had are having my driver door handle replaced (it came straight off the door), the locking mechanism in my front passenger door replaced (at which point the mechanic told me this was going to be an issue with the car forever that I'd have to keep getting fixed). My exhaust has failed many times in different places (Canadian), the last of which having my entire resonator and part of my catalytic converter entirely rebuilt for around $700.

 I have had to replace turn signal bulbs more frequently than I'd like - basically yearly if not more often, and I'm not driving like crazy or anything. My brake issue with the ABS has just come back, and my dad lives five hours away so it's not easy to get it fixed. My oil light no longer resets, my seatbelt sensors don't work, the rear passenger door gets stuck open, the whole car is rusty and dented. 

This morning the car didn't start, and talking with a mechanic friend, it sounds like the starter is the issue. The battery is maybe three years old if not less. Lights and radio come on when I turn the key, electronic locks work, car clicks and doesn't turn over when trying to start. I'm going to try and jump it tonight, but if it doesn't start I'll get it towed to the mechanic.

I've called the mechanic and replacing the starter + labour will be $700 at the very least but probably $950, and that's on top of tow costs. Also, if I bring it in now, I think they'll want to fix my brake issue as well ... so it will probably end up being more than $1k.

 In good condition the car is estimated to be worth maybe $2k, but it's not in good condition. I am honestly done with it - I have to drive 5 hours to visit my parents, it's 4 hours to the nearest major city - I don't always trust that the car will last for long drives. It's miserable to drive in the winter which is not great for Canada. I just got a permanent job where I'm making comfortable money. I don't think I'd have any trouble making car payments and I would love a new car with new features that feels reliable. 

My friends - and probably my dad when I talk to him about this - all think that this is probably where I should call it for this car. I just don't know if I'm giving up too easily. I can afford a $1k fix but it would not be a comfortable expense. The car is incredibly hard to repair because it's built in the worst way imaginable and it's hard to get parts. I'm a handy person but the effort required to even replace a headlight was unbelievable. 

TLDR: the car has needed repairs in the last year alone that total over what the car would be worth, some of which are recurring issues. It has 260k kilometres/160k miles. It doesn't feel safe to drive for long distances. I have a new potential repair bill for $900, and I'm in the best spot possible to buy a new (or used?) car. Everyone around me thinks it's in my best interest to call it and just get a new car - which I would be on board for for reliability and new features - but I don't know if I'm giving up on this car too early. I'm just kind of done with it all and don't want to keep sinking money into a car that I don't feel safe driving, but I'm worried this is an impulsive decision.

Any thoughts? Thanks in advance. :)

I’m not sure what else to do or how to fix this issue
I drive a 2015 Hyundai Elantra and the car for the most part runs just fine especially on freeways but if it’s stopped(usually at intersections or red lights) it’ll stall and then the car won’t move even if I press the brake and gas so I have to turn the entire car off and restart it then when it turns car on it’ll start shaking and even when I press the gas it’ll barely run until I pull over and give it time to reset. 
The car also “breaks down” at random times and is unpredictable when it’ll do it
More info if needed: when the car is stalled the check engine light, battery warning light, and the engine oil warning light turns on. But when I restart the car all of the lights turn off. The check engine stayed on longer other day but then eventually turned off a couple hours later. 
I’ve taken it to oreillys for a battery and engine light test and they both came up with good signs. I’ve also taken the car to two different mechanics who ran diagnostics on the car but both found nothing wrong with it. There was a recall on the car but I have also taken it to the dealership to get it fixed. 
Like the title says I’m not sure what else to do and where else to take especially since it is seemingly fine. "

Water in the passenger footwell!
Hello everyone! I don’t usually post on Reddit, but I think i need some personalized help here. I have a 2016 Subaru Forester 2.5i with ~59,000 miles on it. Whenever I turn the AC on in the car, a TON of water leaks out from under the dashboard on the passenger side. It works fine for about 5 minutes, but then something in there makes a sort of whirring/squeaking/choking(?) noise before the leaking starts. I am not quite sure what to do or where to start, but I included a video of the leakage in action. The air is still cold, and it still blows the air well, but it creates a faucet down below that is soaking my carpet!

Something is definitely wrong with the AC, but I’ve never fixed a car myself beyond changing the oil, so I am a bit lost on what exactly is wrong and what I need to do to fix it.

As far as what I’ve tried already: I tried to get the AC evaporator hose off because a quick google search said to check that for any blockages first, but I can’t seem to get it off on the side that connects to the evaporator. When I pulled it out through the hole in the firewall (where it exits the car to drip onto the road) some water came out of that bottom end while i was finagling it around. If water is coming out of that hose, surely there isn’t a blockage, right? I tried for a solid half hour to detach the hose at the top, lubricated it and everything, but it won’t budge.

Normally I would just ask my dad for help, but he is old and sick and I want to get good at figuring these things out by myself for when he isn’t here anymore. He would also likely tell me not to bother fixing it because running the AC is a frivolous waste of gas, but I just bought this car in April and I’ll be damned if I can’t get my money’s worth on all the features!!

Do you think something needs to be replaced, or is there a blockage somewhere that needs to be unclogged? I am not sure where to even start on this. Any advice would be appreciated, and I’d be happy to answer any clarifying questions. Thank you!!"

2003 Silverado - Loss of Power at Speed &  Can’t Fill Past 3/4 Tank
I’ve got a 2003 Chevy Silverado 4.3L that’s been acting up for a few years now. It sat unused for a while—only really got driven in the summer for lake trips—but even before that, I started noticing something off.

 When I’m on the interstate doing 60–70 mph and need to pass someone or climb a hill, it feels like the truck just doesn’t want to go. I end up flooring the gas pedal and it still struggles to accelerate. Same thing when going up mountains—just feels underpowered. I’ve brought this up to two different shops over the years, but both said they couldn’t find anything wrong.

A while back, the original engine locked up and I had a used one swapped in (with about the same mileage). My dad knows the people who did the work, so I don’t think I got they for over on me. But even with the replacement engine, the same issue continues.

Now recently, I noticed a new problem: when I try to fill the tank, the pump cuts off at 3/4. I hadn’t realized it before because I usually just filled about halfway, but now it won’t top off at all.

Could these two issues be connected somehow? Or are they separate problems? Any ideas what could be going on?

What did I do to my car?
Please try to refrain from bashing me like yesterday. I know I sound like an idiot, but I don’t need to be reminded. A lot of this lacks its actual terminology, but please try to bear with me. Thank you to anyone willing enough to give me some advice!

I spent all day yesterday tinkering with my car. A Honda civic 2006 LX

To start things off, it’s leaking coolant. (Cool, great, I know I need to get it fixed, but it’s hard to find a mechanic that won’t try to scam a young woman out here.)

And it’s also started running hot. That’s where my problem lies.

Well as I said, it’s leaking coolant and I had been “topping it off” to my knowledge. Not knowing that topping it off meant to actually fill it to the brim. (As I said, I am an idiot. I don’t need to be reminded.)

At some point my check engine light came on. Showing codes for my ‘temperature thermostat.’ But eventually turned off.

So with that knowledge and believing I had coolant in my car I figured, “it must obviously be something else.”

So I looked into it, and learned that I could check just by feeling these two pumps and making sure they’re both hot. (Hot-lukewarm, hot-cold, both cold etc.) You probably know what I’m talking about better than I do.

Both pumps were hot.

I’d been using a YouTube video, and the whole time the guy is telling me to watch my hands for the radiator fan located right next to my pumps.

I have two, one being my ac fan and the other my radiator fan. My ac fan would spin, obviously when I turned my ac on, but the other would not.

This is where things get kind of confusing.

So I looked into it, and obviously it could be a number of things. I went with the two easier things. One being checking for a blown fuse and the other being a faulty relay.

I bought a test light. All the fuses were fine.

And then I checked the relays. Switching the ac fan relay and the radiator fan relay.

Lo and behold, the radiator fan starts spinning when the ac is on!

So now I believe I’m getting somewhere, and I take myself up to AutoZone and buy what I believe is the correct piece.

Spoiler alert, it was the wrong piece, but I inevitably decided to try it anyways. (A different relay for a different location. I’m not exactly sure what it’d been for.) don’t ask me why, it all just made sense in my head.

And suddenly both of my fans are spinning, but only with the ac on.

Cars still running hot though, and I’ve been to autozone about 3 different times only to find that they don’t carry the piece that I’m looking for. (Totally fine, I ordered it from Amazon.)

So in conclusion I decided to try again another day. Putting everything back in its original place.

You’d think we’d be coming full circle here. That my ac fan would be running with the ac turned on.

WRONG!! My radiator fan is still spinning when I turn my ac on. >:/

I’ve switched the relays back and forth multiple times.

I looked into it, I rechecked my fuses, and now one of them isn’t lighting up. The 30 amp(?) green one(?) (Don’t ask me.) So I ordered that too.

I have no idea what I did. I’m trying my best here.

My cousin ended up putting coolant in it, and it’s thankfully not running hot. (At the moment.)

Again, I know I need to get the leak fixed. I know that’s my main issue.

But I’m really searching for an explanation on what I did, and why it’s not going back to normal. "

2012 honda civic LX not starting after replacing battery.
so my civic started throwing up a bunch a codes, ABS, VSA, PS, BRAKE, etc. figured it was the battery because i knew it needed to be replaced, so i replaced it. it started after replacing it and was still coding when driven after so i assume the alternator, but now it won’t start again. i’m still assuming alternator since battery looks like it’s not being charged, but i’m gonna try to diagnose once i’m home from work. would love any advice or insight on it, i have a warranty but im not sure how much they’d charge for an alternator.

I did something… finally broke down and getting the sub swapped out.
I feel like I have to preface this rant by saying that I love my ‘23 R1S. But the Achilles heel of this vehicle for me has always been the subpar audio performance. I have tried to love. Trying a multitude of EQ settings, media stream settings, audio fade positions and despite trying, I just cannot get this audio system to hit right. I find that I’m compensating for the lack of low end punch and definition by increasing the volume and the low end response from the speakers as the subwoofer is just not cutting it and I’m afraid I will end up causing damage to the speakers chasing after something that the car can’t do.  

So it’s come to this. I pulled the trigger and set up for a sub swap. Going with the JL 10 inch sub and amplifier combo as that has been verified to work in the existing location.  I can’t wait to hear and hopefully feel the difference! I know not everyone will share with this experience and I’m glad the audio works for those folks. But for me it just makes the driving experience sub par. No pun intended. 
Rant over, thank you. "

The Unluckiest EV owner in the World.
Just wanted to share with the world my crazy and non representative EV truck experience of the last 2.5 years. 

In December 2022 I took delivery of a R1T Quad in Rivian blue. It was my dream car, I got the early order pricing and I was thrilled with it. 

It was not my first EV, I came from an early build Model Y but it was a huge upgrade. It reminded me of my old blue Tacoma but offering the performance, tech, and comfort that I never thought I could afford. 

Sadly it kept going into service. Roughly every 2-3 months it would spend between 11-23 days in service at a time. Everything from rattles, squeaks, leaking hydraulics, leaking air suspension, replacing rear both drive units, etc. Despite all this I stuck with it, it met my States requirements as a lemon in my first year of ownership but I just toughed it out. My fiancée was running out of patience with my truck as every service trip required me driving over an hour one way just to drive an enterprise rental for two weeks. 

The final straw came as I got to take a once in a lifetime month long road trip across the West. I drove from the East coast to Colorado and all over Utah. I got to do some amazing off roading, camping, and hiking. Sadly, during that trip I noticed a bad musty smell. I figured it might be the evaporator coils, something many Tesla owners are familiar with. Not a big deal but annoying. The smell kept getting worse though. Finally on a stop where I pulled out the floor mats to clean them I noticed the drivers floor was soaked and probably had mold growing. The AC was draining into the cabin. The mold was especially concerning because I am allergic to indoor molds, but at least I figured out why I was sick for most of the trip. I tried to get the truck into the Denver service center and then the Colorado Springs service center. Colorado Springs was able to get me in but they said it would likely take 14 days to repair because they would have to replace the entire heater core along with removing most of the carpeting and sanitizing underneath it. I decided at that point to return back to the East coast, have my regular service center fix it and then try and continue the second half of the trip. 

When I was about 400 miles away from home at a charging stop in Ohio I happened to notice my rear tire treads seemed low, which was weird because I put fresh tires in before I left on the trip. Upon inspection I found both rear tires treads were completely worn down to the metal cords on the inner part of both tires. 

I decided to slightly air down the tires and basically try to limp home at 50 mph. I made it about 70 miles from home when one of those tires failed and I had the truck towed to Rivian from the side of the highway. I have a full size spare but the other tire was close to failure as well. This was the straw that broke the camels back. The truck recently had an alignment done, I had done off roading but nothing that should result in a severe misalignment to cause this. Rivian had replaced both rear drive units before I left on the trip but I am not sure if the tire exploding was related to that. What troubled me more was that if I hadn’t had glanced at my rear tires I would have never known there was a problem. The tire could have exploded with me going full speed down the highway. There was no steering wheel shake or other tell. 

At that point I asked Rivian to buy the truck back. It kicked off a long process that went back forth but finally we came to an agreement despite the truck being too old for the formal lemon process. 

I decided I still wanted an EV truck. I was not going to get a Cybertruck because my fiancée would leave me and I did not want all the negative attention, plus at the time they were over $100k. I decided to go with a Ford Lightning because it was a simpler suspension set up, and I just figured it would be more reliable and easier to access service. I did the dealership dance and got a killer deal. I drove the Lightning for about few days and then noticed after dropping off some pavers and mulch for my Mom that the front of the roof between the windshield and the moon roof had deep scratches and dents. I figured out immediately this damage must’ve come from the car carrier. I picked up the truck at night and despite using a two page delivery checklist from the Lightning forums I missed the damage. The dealer did offer to fix it in their body shop for free. I was annoyed, I did not want a brand new truck that had body work off the bat but they weren’t going to take it back. I brought it in for them to repair. 

Two weeks into that repair I got a notification in the Ford App that were was a battery/powertrain malfunction. I hoped this was just a glitch or a result of the dealer having to disable the HV system while doing body work. Sadly their service department then confirmed it was indeed a bad battery module. They would have to drop the pack and replace the module. I took that as a sign and requested a buyback. Ford initially refused but I sent a frustrated email to the Ford CEOs public email about the dealer and the entire experience. To Fords credit a member of the executive office reached out to me and took over the buy back case personally. She got it done and that was that with the Lightning. 

At this point I made a decision that many would say is crazy. I went back to Rivian. I just loved the brand and there is truly nothing like the truck. I knew my truck was a lemon and hoped lightning would not strike twice. I ended up leasing a Tri Max R1T in Rivian Blue. Now 5 months into ownership its getting ready for its second service trip. Alignment problems, rattles, sound system rattles/resonance. 

I still have to drive over an hour but at least this time I got a loaner. An early VIN R1T. Worked flawlessly for the 11 days I had it…

I truly do not think my experience is representative but maybe the universe is telling me I shouldn’t drive an EV truck. "

Leased 2 Rivians in March. Both are in the service center. It’s been hell.
So, my wife and I leased 2 Rivians to take advantage of the $200 off per month lease. I got the T, she got the S. My T broke down in the middle of the interstate with less than 350 miles on it. It’s been in the shop since early April, and they had to replace the 12v battery, ac compressor, and the pyrofuse(?) Not sure what that one is, but their target pickup date is next Wednesday. Their initial diagnosis was that they needed to replace the high voltage battery, but that’s been ruled out for now.

When the T was in the center, they set me up with a rental. It was horrible. I got a loaner after complaining that I can’t drive the rental because I needed a truck for work. So since, I’ve been driving the T loaner, and the card key is a nightmare to use.

Then I found some blue/green liquid under my wife’s S in the garage floor after she took it out for work. So I searched online and found stories where the car had to be towed to be serviced at the center. So I made a service claim and sent pictures. Lo and behold, they sent a tow truck to pick it up. No estimated date yet. And no loaner.

Now we are regretting getting Rivians. Even after this whole thing gets fixed, still leaves a bad taste. 

I know cars can have problems and finding it out now rather than a year out is better, but not being able to drive my car that I’m paying for a month now is frustrating. 

Are we just bad luck or is this pretty common for new Rivians?"

AC not blowing cold from right hand side front vents
Allow me to preface my questions by saying that on pick up the AC broke before i even left the lot. Apparently a hose was damaged and leaked, causing the whole system to fail.

  
Now the issue is that the vents on the passenger side just seem to blow external air instead of cold air. We have tried syncing and unsyncing, cranking the cold temp all the way down on her side, both sides, etc. Nada. Worked great the first few days. Has anyone seen this issue or is there anything dumb we might be doing wrong?

  
Also tried a reset with the hazard warning and still same problem. Any tips or tricks or hints appreciated."

Rivian broke down during demo ride
So I have my R2 reservation from March of 24. Took the wife to demo drive the R1S to check it out and get our feet wet into Rivian. Not even 2 miles into the drive the vehicle took a shit. All power was lost, electrical warning message, pull over, while a loud grinding / breaking noise from the rear end went on. Coasted to a parking lot and called the 800 number. Had to wait a good amount of time before someone answered and they had us reset the vehicle. Still no go. They contacted the local dealership to come pick us up. 

I’m not sure how I feel about this. While we want an electric vehicle, having the demo vehicle take a shit on us was probably the worst first impression you can get.  Not being able to connect directly with our dealership is always not my favorite thing. Is this a one off or….? We are close to a dealer but don’t want a vehicle that’s being paid for having to be wrenched on all the time. "

Driver Side Signal Light Glitch - Service Request Narrowly Avoided
Today I was washing my truck, and for this i had car wash mode enabled.  (not sure if the mode itself was a required element of me triggering this gltich), or not.

Posting this in hopes it helps someone one day

After the car wash (upon parking the truck), the truck gave a message of  Headlight System Not Working, Service it Soon.  I cant remember if the truck was out of car wash mode or still in car wash mode when i received this warning (although i am pretty sure i had disabled car wash mode by the time i saw the message) .  Worth noting that while washing the truck and while it was in car wash mode,  I dropped the tailgate, and raised it.  

I drove home (about 2 kms)  not knowing full extent of what wasn't working,  upon arriving at home, found that 

\- front driver signal would not work  
\- rear driver signal would not work

\- four ways didn't work on driver side only (expectedly so based on above) 

\- the mirror signal **was working**

\-driver headlamp would stay on even if lights were shutoff (until the truck went into sleep mode) 



I performed a full restart of the truck, same symptoms after restart.   I then broke down and issued a service ticket, only to find my options were , have it flat towed to service center,  (ottawa - montreal), drive it to montreal with malfunctional light system,  (not sure why they would even suggest this as an option), or wait for a big enough backlog in my area, to warrant them sending a mobile service unit (they estimated it would be 3-4 weeks before that occured.  ).  Kind of absurd for a vehicle that isn't legally road worthy. 

I then removed the front trunk panels, and raised the front tub some to look for any wiring harnesses that might be loose ,none were, or if they were, pushing them snug all over again , did nothing. 

After putting the truck back together,  and still having same issue, and on the precipice of giving up,/dreading someone towing my truck 2 hours away...., I'm not sure what exactly made me think, well why not try **lowering the tailgate , and raising it again, which happily and very surprisingly cleared the glitch.**   (mostly because i had opened it and closed while doing the car wash) 

Crazy that dropping the tailgate and shutting it again, cleared whatever my truck was suffering that disabled control of the left front and back signals.  Also annoying that i did that easy step, after the hard step of disassembling the frunk panels and such. 

Hopefully this helps someone , and ideally before they tear apart the front trunk trunk area, looking for possible loose wiring harness ;),   or having Rivian flat bed tow your truck to a service center. "

Excited to take delivery… but a bit nervous
Last week, I got the notification that my R1S Dual Standard was ready for pickup on Tuesday. I was really excited. My wife and I had sold our secondary car in preparation for delivery, getting ready to put the money down toward the R1S. Then, I received a text on Monday saying, “Hey, we heard a weird noise in the back with the suspension, and we think there might be a problem.”

At that point, after just finishing all the payments and finance papers, I was like, “Okay, when will it be ready?” They replied, “Wednesday, if it’s as simple to fix as we think it is!”

I was still really excited for Wednesday. But then I noticed they had scheduled me for 9:30 AM, which was impossible for me to make. So, I rescheduled to 3:45 PM on Wednesday. Then, tonight, I get another text: “Hey, we fixed that part, but now there’s another part that broke. We need to order it from Illinois, and it may take a week, but we don’t think it’ll take that long.”

Now, I’m starting to feel a little nervous. It’s a brand new car that just left the factory, and it’s already having back-to-back issues. I’m worried I might be getting a lemon. Am I overthinking this? or is anyone else seeing it from my perspective?"

R1s battery crap out part 2
Wife’s 2025 R1s 12 volt battery was replaced and “fixed” by Rivian earlier this week. They assured us the issue was a freak incident and won’t be an issue moving forward. Today, we’re moving across state from Reno to Southern California with our lives packed away in our cars as we caravan down. Long story short, her car broke down twice today and will now be left in Hesperia for Rivian to pick up and fix again. We were luckily able to get a uhaul at 655pm, 5 minutes before closing. We just got back to her car, unloaded and loaded up the uhaul. I hope this is the last time I see this lemon of a R1s. We will be canceling our lease ASAP and won’t return to Rivian as customers anytime soon. Incredibly disappointed in a company that we purchased from and invested in. Hope all of your experiences are better than ours."

How does the service towing work?
Broke down while at my parents and had to leave my R1S there. Guessing it is a busted CV axle. I won’t be present for the tow, does Rivian send them the towing guide etc? Is it a company local to where the service center is or do they find someone at the location where the car is at?"

Meet StormRider! My early Christmas gift! 
Finally, after months of contemplating, I pulled it off! Huge thanks to this incredible community for the support!

Picked up my R1S StormBlue Tri-motor from Rivian San Jose. Shoutout and job well done, amazing Rivian San Jose team! They made every step of the purchase process as smooth as possible. Also, big thanks to Rivian Costa Mesa, Van Nuys, and Pasadena for showing me all inside out of the R1S. (Yes, I took 5-test drives up and down California before finally deciding to go with the R1S Tri-motor.)

The purchase process was smooth. I got one from inventory which matched the exact specification of what I wanted. So I was able to secure a $3000 ICE discount. I was worried after reading hundreds of comments about customers running into issues on pick-up day or within a few hundred miles. I was going to drive it 200 miles to my home right after pick-up with family in the car, so that made me even more worried.

I texted the list of most common issues I came across on this forum to the delivery team so they could check for it and make sure the vehicle was free of all those major issues. I was sure to reject delivery if any of those issues (cracked windscreen or sunroof, major panel misalignment, non-working AC/heater, or seat heater, misaligned RGB lights, loud noise of heat pump, air suspension issue, or car that is not leveled) were to be found, and it would have ruined my weekend and the trip. They even charged the car to 95% for me so I didn’t have to take a break for charging while driving back home. The car is solidly built. I used the car delivery checklist from here. No panel alignment issues, no paint defects. The car was free of any issues whatsoever. The car had the latest software installed, but the Home Screen was stuck in low frame mode, and you could tell the windmill was moving very slowly. It broke my heart, but the first thing I had to do when I sat in the car was to soft reboot it, and it fixed the issue. Everything else was within my acceptable specs ;-)

On the way home, I took a quick stop to check out the charging at Rivian Adventure Network. Sadly, it wasn't free. So if you have used the referral code to place an order, you will get $750 worth of credit for Rivian Gear Shop and 6 months of free charging at RAN. But it doesn't take effect until 1 week after delivery. You will get a message. I got the credits on the 6th day after taking delivery.

500 miles and over 1 week of being a Rivian owner, I am very happy with my choice. No major issues so far. The new .47 update even made it better. Only one small issue I found is that the rear headliner is sagging in one corner because one of the clips is not fully secured. I booked a mobile service appointment, and sadly, it's 2.5 months out, which I was expecting. That one area Rivian can really improve is either having more service stations or training and allowing third-party service stations to repair their cars.

The car drives amazingly. It’s better than my wife's Tesla MYP. In fact, my wife is in love with Rivian and looking into replacing her MYP with an R2 when it comes out. One thing Rivian is lacking is its software. I was not expecting self drive capability with R1S but it's at least 5-10 years behind Tesla. Even simple highway assist doesn’t work on a lot of highways. ACC is very basic. Lane centering is poor. My 6-year-old BMW has better highway assist, lane centering, auto lane change, and free-hand driving on highways with traffic under 40 miles. Rivian needs to improve big time on it. Other than that, I am enjoying this car big time!

Everyone, have happy holidays and safe travels!

First snow experience with R1T and my choice for snow tires
I took my R1T from the Denver metro area to ski in Summit County, in the high country. I've been driving a Subaru Impreza for years and it does great in the snow. I wasn't sure how the R1T, being at least twice as heavy as the Subaru would do in the snow. The mountains were getting snow overnight and exiting the I70 tunnel at the Continental Divide changed everything, as it often does.  The roads were completely snow-covered and a little slick. In Snow Mode, the R1T was excellent.  

After a great day of skiing fresh powder and heading home, CDOT had closed I70 to the tunnel. The only option to get home was to go over Loveland Pass (12,000 ft elevation). No time like the present to really test out the truck.  The roads had much more snow than in the morning on I70. Near the summit several other cars were getting stuck - just running out of momentum to get up the last mile to the summit.  The truck didn't have any problems at all.  I really like one-pedal driving. Descending down miles of steep roads off the pass, I appreciated one-pedal even more.  I never had to touch the brakes.

Like a lot of users of this sub, I've been looking for snow tires and read all the posts.  After some solid winter driving today I thought I'd share that I bought LT275/65R-20 Firestone Winterforce LT E, and a set of 20"" wheels. I'll run the original 21"" AS Scorpions in the warmer months.  The Firestones do have a bit more road noise but nothing too distracting.  The only time I broke traction today was when I pulled out of the parking lot and stepped on it, in part to see how it would do, so not really a surprise.  Time will tell how well they hold up, but today was a confidence boost for winter driving with the R1T and Firestones."

R1S - First long road trip lessons learned
After owning an R1S G2 for 3 months, I hadn't charged anywhere beyond my L2 garage charger. I wish I'd had a bit more knowledge prior to taking a trip beyond the supposed 270mi range. It was a 200mi trip one way. My passengers and I were not pleased with the experience.  
  
Let me know your thoughts from your first trip beyond the vehicle range. Here are my lessons learned...:

1.) Don't assume the range is consistent. I thought my vehicle had \~270mi range. According to the Rivian infotainment chassis tab, my vehicle averages 2.41mi/kwh. It turns out if it's cold and rainy, that range may be less than advertised. The vehicle averaged about 1.8mi/kwh on this trip with temps in the 40s, raining buckets.  

2.) The Rivian infotainment map offers filters where you can select showing only charging stations meeting the criteria you want such as the charging network, charging rates and user ratings. I was routed to Podunk chargers all over. It was an egg hunt. I didn't know  the filters existed. I'm not sure setting those filters would have routed me to better/faster stations but at least I could have found them on the map. See the filter buttons at the top of the map after clicking on the lightning bolt on the lower right to show the chargers.

3.) Chargers don't always work. I stopped at a couple professional-looking Electrify America stations (via Rivian routing). Most that I tried didn't work. In the worst case it took several minutes for the charger to time out trying to connect to the mothership. In one case, I tried 4 of 20 plugs at the EA station before finding one that worked. It was more like a game of BINGO than a purchase process.

4.) Download the PlugShare smartphone app or similar. This saved me when Rivian maps routed me to a ""1.0"" rated station when an 8.6 rated L3 station was 2mi away. It also provides a second opinion to the Rivian infotainment map.

5.) Last, but not least, purchase a [NACS adapte](https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B0C6MBJC9P/ref=ppx_yo_dt_b_search_asin_title?ie=UTF8&psc=1)r - if you don't already have one. After waiting 3+ months for Rivian to send it, I broke down and purchased one (post disaster road trip). Surprise! ... the Tesla Supercharger network actually works. Per Google, there are \~6,750 Supercharger stations (\~63k plugs) in the U.S., and \~400 RAN charger stations. After charging at two Supercharger stations, both maxed out at \~540mi/hr charge rate, and \~320mi/hr at the low end at \~80% full. The plugs worked on the first try, no BINGO game. BTW, the Rivian infotainment map filter allows showing Tesla chargers.

My recommendation to Rivian - the out of the box experience sucks - at least force the user through the recharge filters (to pop up) when a user profile is routing their first trip beyond the range of the vehicle, perhaps the first 3 times. It defaulted to RAN network only, and any level charging and all/all ratings (the defaults should have shown all only highly rated chargers at or above 150kw IMHO).

Leased R1S, Broke Down on First Day
Does anyone have any advice on what to do on a lease, if the vehicle breaks down/has issues from day 1? I took possession of the vehicle the other morning, and when we took it out the same afternoon, a bunch of warning lights came on and a message saying that the vehicle is shutting down. We called Rivian roadside, and rebooted twice as instructed, but no success. Eventually had it towed to the service center, and got a loaner the next day. The service center is backed up, next appointment available in November, but they agreed to take a look at our vehicle sooner. It’s been a 4 days, but still no updates from their side. This is a 2025 Gen2. It’s been quite frustrating to say the least."

The wait is killing me!
I've delayed my decision for a new car for years, making due with my tiny Subaru BRZ and wife's Model Y in the context of our growing family. My day 1 cybertruck reservation will go unfilled because pricing and quality are terrible (and the wife hates it). I was holding out hope for the Volvo EX90 to launch well, but it is very late, expensive and software stuff will remain incomplete for the next year. The XC90 was another contender, but it seems it won't get it's long-overdue refresh for at least another year.

So I finally broke down and re-considered the R1S when reviews of improved handling started coming out. I test drove one last week, found one in inventory in my spec (standard battery, dual motor, green) and signed a lease. I have a VIN assigned and the sales person told me its sitting in the factory parking lot, waiting for carrier assignment to be transported to my nearest service center (Atlanta).

I'm just venting here because I'm surprised at my own lack of patience after playing the long game for the last 3 years. Apparently there's nothing else to do, and no other information available until it's transported to Atlanta and those folks reach out to schedule delivery. Could be a week. Could be a month."

Issues with my new Gen2 R1S
Just picked up mine two weeks ago, version 2024.19.02. 

I live in Greater Seattle Area, so hopefully my case can be a good reference for people in the same area. AFAIK, until now(10/18/2024) RIVIAN can't sell cars directly in WA. That means buyers are NOT protected by WA lemon law. And based on my experience, illinois lawyers and many nation wide lemon law firms seem not very experienced with RIVIAN brand. Only few firms are willing to continue, but I somehow have trust issue with them too... Plus involving lawyers could make it take much longer and lawyers can push you to sign the agreement you might not like. I recommend filing complaint through BBB autoline.

UPDATE 2024/11/14:

I signed and sent back the agreements on 10/10/2024, and RIVIAN reassured me the whole time that I wouldn’t need to worry about the 10/24/2024 payment. However, they didn’t take any action on the lease account until I pushed them.

In the end, I had to make the last payment (around $650) myself to protect my credit. Chase informed me that they actually quoted the payoff on 10/29/2024. I suspect the number does not match the one in the agreement.

I don't if I can get my last payment back. 


UPDATE 2024/10/18:

Repurchase process was unbeliveably smooth, the repurchasing team responds emails actively. In the week of Oct 7, I signed all the paperwork requested by RIVIAN to transfer ownership. In the end, I lost ~600 USD for 1022 miles on the odometer. And from the work order, it seems RIVIAN still have NO clues on many issues. For example, I still don't know why my suspension and driver stalk are not working. 


When I returned the rental car, the guy from enterprise told me they will charge RIVIAN ~5500 USD for the 3 month Ford Edge rental that surprised me a bit...


In the past two weeks, I am asking about when the lease account will be closed and when can I receive my check. RIVIAN says it will be 7 -10 business days and says it should be done by next payment due (10/24/2024). I hope they can do it on time.

UPDATE 2024/09/30:

Had a phone call with the field manager. It seems they made this phone call just to make sure I want a repurchase rather than replacement.   

And all he can do is to submit another request to the guide team. He can’t answer any question about repurchase, like how refund look like etc. He told me to contact him again if I am not contacted until this Friday.

I am a bit confused why this conversation can’t be made through emails to save time on both side.

UPDATE 2024/09/25:

Missed the phone call from service center since i was out of town. Talked with the field manager through emails to re-schedule a discussion about repurchase next week.

Later I received an email from BBB auto line said the manufacturer has offered a repurchase. I kind of understood it was BBB pushed them to contact me.


UPDATE 2024/09/19:

Sent a buy back request to demands@rivian.com on 09/03, asked them again on 09/09. COMPLETELY IGNORED by RIVIAN. 

I requested an arbitration with BBB. Meanwhile also looking for a lawyer in my case. Washington residents aren’t protected by state law, I have to look for lawyers in Illinois which make it a bit harder.


UPDATE 2024/09/03:

No updates for 1 week. I contacted the customer service again, all I get is ""legal team will contact you as soon as possible."" But how soon? No idea. This makes me talk with a lemon law firm to represent me. I am really tired with Rivian.

UPDATE 2024/08/26:

The vehicle has been in the service center for over 6 weeks(42 calendar days or 30 business days). It should pass the threshold of lemon law(whatever WA or IL). Therefore I contacted the servive center to lemon it first. I am not surprised there is no response because in the past 6 weeks I only got 1 or 2 updates for the USB C issues.

Then I contacted the customer service on the website, the rep promised he sent a legal form internally for me. However I can't get any confirmation like email or document at this moment. All I can do is to wait for repurchaing team to contact me.

UPDATE 2024/07/12:

Rivian towed the vehicle from my house and set up a rental car for me. Signed paperwork that listed 10 issues to be repaired.

UPDATE 2024/07/10:

I haven't get any called yet so I made 2 online chats starting from 2pm ish:

i. The rep told me I will be contacted in 30 minutes from Bellevue Center.

Waiting for an hour, no calls are coming in, so I made a scond chat with them. This counts as a second time rivian broke their promises.

ii. The rep had zero context on the appointments and tried to tell me go to new Seattle service center. After a lot of back and forth, he finally scheduled a tow to Bellevue service center this Friday 9 am and told me there will be 3-4 weeks(or more) for the wait . Afterwards, leadership called me, reassuring tow is coming.


In the meantime, I am contacting legal service for my case.


UPDATE 2024/07/09:

I got a phone call ~9am from rivian. 

The rep was surprised I had to drive vehicle home yesterday.

The rep asked me for more details about each issue I've met. I told him I already gave all of them yesterday and I didn't want to waste time repeating my long list in the phone call. The rep said he would sync up with the team and would come back to me today via text.

The time I wrote down this is 17:31 PDT and I did not receive any update from rivian.

In addition, more bugs are found when I manually turn off auto update in the car (guess what, I can't do it through my phone. As I mentioned before, remote control is a dead function to my experience):

13. Navigation blackscreen, recorded a video and opened another ticket.

14. Proximity locking not working: Recorded a video and opened another ticket.


UPDATE 2024/07/08:

I can’t wait for customer services getting back to me because it seems they never come back based on my purchasing experience. I first tried to make a phone call to them this morning. Unfortunately the phone call was cutoff in the middle due to weak signals. And I really don’t want to wait for another half an hour in line for a human to talk with me. So that I drove the car directly to the service center. The guy helped us is very nice. 

Rivian refused my request to return it since it does not have return policy on lease. 

Then we went through all the issues and I was told for the safety concerns last night it was marked as high priority and they will investigate it on their end remotely, reading logs. Meanwhile, the only option I have is to drive the vehicle back without investigation. I was told I will probably be reached out by the end of this week. Basically they refuse to keep the car onsite or tow it to my house.

In the end, we send this entire list with photos and videos and timestamps to the guide and he forwarded this to the service team. I am supposed to get some answer by the end of the week. I plan to not touching this vehicle again until there is some update.

UPDATE 2024/07/07:

11. In the most recent drive, I got couple of BIG notifications: 

a. driver stalk is not working; 

b. Performance limited right now.

c. Front camera/sensors off.

d. service suspension system soon

e. Speed limit until serviced

I don’t know what hell is going on now. I had to drive 20mph home. I made a phone call to customer services. I did a full restart as suggested then the alerts are gone. However I am really worried to drive it again. Imagine having this issue on a highway is terrible. The lady told me she will call me tomorrow for scheduling the service. Let’s see how it goes.

12. Parking assist audo is always turned off after sleeping.


UPDATE 2024/07/07:

9. USB C ports in the console completely unusable. They magically recovered from the soft reset from 10.

10. All Cameras are unavailable in a recent drive. Soft reset is required and it recovered… However the audio is gone again after this reset.

2024/07/06:

1. External drive disconnection: The issue is there from day one. I tried different drives (new and old) and cables. After several soft resets, I finally set it up. However it kept disconnecting several times and I finally gave up.
2. No audio( even for the turn signals). This happened twice in the past 2 weeks. The second time it happened, a hard reset couldn't help. And it magically recovered after a sleep reset.
3. Motion camera folder is empty: The saved events show up occasionally... Most of time it is empty...
4. Remote climate control: It NEVER works for me. The app always says it has issues.
5. Front radar blocked: This happened once when my wife drove it home and scared her. She said it happened after a fast charging session. A hard reset resolved this issue.
6. Clicking noise from vents ( or may be somewhere else...) that is very annoying from day one.
7. This might not be an issue. When in camp mode, the car keeps unlocking itself makes me unsafe sleep in the car.
8. This might not be an issue either. I don't know how to turn off proximity lock when it is at home. Now it keeps locking and re-locking itself.

With so many issues, I finally decided to submit a request but it says appointments are not available at Bellevue SC...

I don't know what to say. I love this car. It has many outdoor features I like. I am still sort of disappointed with so many bugs and the limited service...."

One Month of Ups and Downs
So it's the end of my first month of ownership and it's been a ride. I can't say it's been great, but let's see if I can be fair about describing my whole new owner experience from start to finish, from demo to despair at having my truck towed back to the service center in shame. Sometimes shit happens and the real story is not necessarily why it happened, but how it was handled. 



This is a roller coaster. Buckle up and keep your arms and legs inside the vehicle at all times. Or don't I guess because this isn't mandated by law in Texas but the disclaimer you signed before going in the gate means you can't sue if this shit goes off the rails.



**TL:DR**

Vehicle: After a very long bout of researching, comparing features with the competition and waiting for years for the correct opportunity, I got what I wanted in an R1T and think they made a great thing. It was on the road for 8 days and 200 miles before suffering a number of failures and towed back to the service center.

Customer Service: Abysmal. I will make no concessions. I just about cancelled the order before it even got here but the service center saved it.

Roadside Assistance: Pretty great honestly.

Service Center (Austin): About as fast attacking the problem as any mechanic I've been to locally and reasonably responsive. Truck was towed in and was looked at within two days of getting there. Spent two weeks so far being worked on for a bad CV boot, a blocked air valve in the air suspension and a cryptic problem with the rear drive unit that an engineer was called in to look at.

**Chapter 1: The Beginning Part At The Beginning**

So I had been planning for quite a long time for the successor to my current truck to be electric. I am a technical person in a technical career from a technical family. Even if I didn't care about the positive impacts of no emissions and charging at home, I have long since come to the conclusion that electric drive trains are inherently superior and This Is The Way. The question has only been when batteries and production economics would converge into a vehicle that I both wanted and could afford. It seemed we were about to arrive in 2020 and then COVID ruined everything. I'd been waiting ever since, very much interested in the coming F-150 Lightning, Silverado EV and to see if this Rivian outfit would get off the ground. 



I won't bother with the House Hunters-esque fake story about how I was jumping between these three options and had to make a decision. You already know I bought a Rivian. Gen 1 2024 R1T a week before the Gen 2 reveal. So why?



The competition was mostly down between the F-150 and the Rivian. The Silverado EV is there in a technical sense, but I wasn't willing to wait 2 more years for them to get through the early adopters, produce trims that cost less than 90k and sort out any first-year production hiccups. Too late to the game. The cybertruck was there in a technical sense too, but even if there was one selling for less than six figures, no. Just no. If the Ramcharger had been a thing 3 years earlier I'd probably have been looking over there too because my work commute would've been all-battery, but they were also too late to the game. I spent weeks and months watching the online Ford and Rivian stores for price changes and constantly comparing builds. Once we hit the Rivian price changes in April/May with the standard+ battery I realized something. If I lined up the HP, battery range and other features on the adventure R1T with a Lightning with an XLT or Lariat trim that had mostly the same things, they cost pretty much the same. The base price of the Rivian was way higher but...it came with a lot more by default. Ford has that big corporate tendency to bundle options together so you wind up spending more money. Getting the large battery on the XLT Ford meant another 15k. Not because that's what the battery cost, but because getting it required another upgrade package over the base model and one that I didn't want. It included 22"" wheels, except what I wanted was the base model's 18"" wheels because I wanted tires with more sidewall. Want leather seats? Platinum trim only, 92k please. And I did want leather seats, because my cloth ones were a bitch to clean with the dust around here. Is that going to motivate me to spend 15k more to 'be a tech titan' as their byline says and get that leather interior as a byproduct? No. Go home. You're drunk. GM at least lets you add that as an option by itself.



While I had a short list of what I wanted, it doesn't really pair up with EV marketing. I am tech-y, but I am not a tech enthusiast. In the car world I might be the equivalent of that sysadmin joke where they cast any IoT device out of their house, use mechanical locks on everything and only ever keep a printer at home next to a loaded gun for whenever it makes the wrong sound. Don't get me wrong, despite the hyperbole it's not about being afraid of tech. It's about maybe knowing all of its shortcomings too well. Automotive IT security for most OEMs is hilariously terrible and invasive data harvesting is endemic now. Seriously. Look at what Nissan does. I don't use most forms of phone integration or on-board navigation for those reasons. That doesn't stop tech stuff from factoring into my purchasing decisions, but it sort of does it in the opposite way. It's actually a turnoff if I'm expected to pay extra for things I don't use. Double turnoff if it's something I actively have to hunt down in its lair in deep in the interface and viscerally disable. I'll outright say L2 driver assistance has no value to me despite the fact every OEM has some form of it, because if I have to sit there 'ready to take control' at any time then I am not a passenger regaining commute time for vital stuff like sleeping or goofing off on the internet. I've read too deeply into the shortcomings of current self-driving programming to trust it. It's extremely easy to become complacent with it, or you can be constantly on your toes questioning if drifting toward the K-rail on that exit ramp is the system trying to kill you. I'd much rather the computer was the one making panicked bleating noises when it sensed the entity at the controls was doing something wrong. Well, when something was actually going wrong and not being a little dramatic because road construction was messing with lane markings, or some car ahead had turned off the road but still had a part of its ass-end in the shoulder as we went by. Adaptive cruise, blind spot monitoring and backup cameras are appreciated, but those things were common two generations ago. I'll even say ventilated seats are sweet. However I despise touchscreens for vehicle controls and it seems that at least for the near term it's both a futurism thing and a way for OEMs to cut costs. Rivians in fact seemed to have a lot of neat but ultimately overengineered widgits like actuating door handles and motorized vents that might be a pain to fix when they break. So you might be asking wtf was I doing buying one instead of an F-150 Lightning work truck? The answer to that is you can't just buy a base Lighting Pro or XLT with a leather interior, the performance motor or the bigger battery pack. You need bundles! Upgrades! 



So who do you think was the worst offender in trying to get more money out of me for features I didn't care about or actively did not want?



The going method with big OEMs seems to be to stuff high trim packages with oodles of widgets like heated mirrors that make it seem like people are getting a lot for the money, while many of them cost bupkis to install at the factory and have an outsized impact on your future maintenance costs when it stops working. There's a reason the highest margin is on high trim vehicles, after all. I was actually pleased the F-150 XLT had infotainment and climate control buttons under the screen. Buttons! In 2024! But the higher trims didn't. For whatever reason tactile buttons are tools of the plebians despite being better. Given my ambivalence about Cool New Tech I probably would have held onto my current truck until the wheels fell off. Except for that one thing: Electric drive train superior. ICE inferior. I'll admit I actually feel some measure of guilt for driving a full-sized 16mpg behemoth and it seemed so petty to continue to do so another 10 years for so trivial a reason as wanting a model with the perfect set of cup holders or whatever. If I did some soul searching though the Fords feel...overpriced. Not necessarily POS on the drivetrain or engineering but I've never felt that what you got out of a Lariat+ trim with largely only interior changes was worth the extra money. Most everything under the hood is still the same. It doesn't get you better paint than the work truck. If you don't know Ford paint, well uh, you'll be perfectly fine never finding out. So anyway, where do you go if you want higher material quality and don't actually care very much about huge numbers of gadgety features common to luxury brands in the 70k+ price range? 



The answer was a bit unintuitive. Regardless of whatever complaints I had, the 'luxury' Rivian seemed to be better value for the money. It was expensive, sure, but from my reading it seemed like Rivian was putting a lot behind its first run of vehicles and eating the cost to lay the foundations for a good reputation. Initial reviews were good and it seemed Rivian was at least trying to hedge against suffering initial huge bad press that would be largely impossible to recover from. I'd heard people complain Rivians were somewhat spartan compared to luxury vehicles in their price range but tended to be well built with high quality materials. The short bed was a nuisance but nobody else was making a 2-door or extended cab version truck in any size with a standard 6.5ft box. What actually pushed me to make a decision was when I was going over the full specs and encountered the scourge of Embiggification. New trucks have been getting progressively wider and taller and longer and it mattered because apparently neither the F-150 or the Silverado EV would fit in my garage. After walking past a shiny new Ram in a random parking lot with the hoodline near shoulder level something...snapped. It got my attention, but not in the good way. You know how something grabs your train of thought and throws it off the rails while saying something like ""The fuck is this?"" while you're trying to get to a restaurant? It wasn't even lifted! I was upset. Incensed. Maybe it was the most egregious example of a trend I'd quietly noticed in all the newest trucks with front ends a mile tall. Who did this? Why?! It was already a pain in the ass to reach the center of the hood when washing! I actually wanted smaller but would've settled for the same size I had. My predecessor truck actually did (barely) fit in the garage along with its sibling SUV, clearing the door by about 2"" if I gingerly push it in neutral until it touches the wall and climb out the passenger side. It's come in handy for a couple hurricanes, hail storms and tornado warnings. I wanted to do my charging indoors and also retain the option to keep the most expensive vehicle I'd ever bought out of the weather as much as possible. The Rivian was actually smaller than any of them. A full foot shorter. A slight bit narrower. Only taller if the suspension was set to max height. And by that I mean it was about the footprint of full sized trucks from three or four model generations ago. Who else was making...mid-sized EV trucks? 



I had resolved that I would never buy the first model year of a new vehicle under any circumstances. However the R1T was on its third year and hopefully the early series production bugs had been worked out and fixed on the line. The refresh was coming and demand for the inventory was probably at a low ebb. Since I wasn't going to buy a first-year Gen 2 (keep to the code!) I thought maybe my time had come. Maybe there'd be deals. To be honest I thought that since Gen 2's primary goal was to cut costs, it was entirely possible it wasn't just the same thing built more efficiently. If any cost concessions impacted durability nobody would find out until the first ones had spent a few years in the wild. That's largely speculation in the absence of any real world data, mind. Also changing that much stuff would doubtlessly create a new series of its own bugs and hiccups that would take a couple years to sort out.



So off I went to Austin to lay hands on one.



**Chapter 2: Reality Is Real and Hate Makes You Stronger**



I had seen a Rivian in the wild exactly once for a few seconds. I never had the opportunity to actually touch one. I'll be straight up, the R1T is a magnificent creature and the internet pictures didn't do it justice. Some people like angles and boxes as has been the trend of the last decade. I like curves. The psuedo side-step box with the wide, arcing fenders struck a particular chord along with the distinctive Rivian front end. Suffice it to say I was a fan. The interior was much better than I expected. The demo model had the black with ash wood. To me it seemed not just comfortable, but polished. Not unsurpassed if you were shopping the out and out luxury brands, but vastly better than the pleather-trimmed cloth I would've been able to get with an equal-priced Lightning. It didn't have a glove box or as many compartments. Didn't care.



Coming from a spring suspension full size truck it's a little hard for me to describe the difference air suspension makes. It's...wonderful. The guide deliberately took me to an area of many speedbumps, put the suspension in soft and dared me to just...hit them without slowing down. The interesting bit is how it damps road vibrations much better and not just bumps. Colour me impressed. Nothing so tall or heavy should corner that well either, but it does. Vastly less noise than anything I'd been used to driving and ultimately a very quiet vehicle. My uh, predecessor truck's base sound system at normal volume was basically inaudible over highway noise so being able to hear shit is great. I know some people are critical but that wasn't much of a sticking point for me. Once again, who else was going to deliver the vehicle that was largely the same AND had a better sound system? For the same-ish money. Also not in three years.



I spent about 2 hours there crawling over the vehicles in the lot, looking at the different colours, interiors and asking technical questions. Overall a great experience. They weren't able to answer ALL my questions because of Texas dealer laws. So I was paired up with a guide who answered the remaining purchasing questions. While I was there I also learned of the May discounts on the vehicles in the inventory. Two days after that test drive I picked one out of the shop and put a deposit down. A forest green dual motor. I wanted the EV credit and had to choose a discounted large battery (wooo sale!) over the performance upgrade.



Aaaand that's where the music stopped. Record scratch. I was under the impression that I had to complete all the purchase tasks in order to schedule delivery. I was also told that delivery had to happen by June 1 to get the sale pricing, leaving me a week and change to get that sorted so it was going to be a time crunch. So I did all the things. The day after Memorial Day I had the truck on my insurance, payment sorted and contracts signed. But as soon as I put that initial deposit down, I was ghosted. Rivian people do answer the main phone line and the chat, but you actually cannot get in contact with anyone who knows what's going on with your purchase directly. You cannot be transferred to them. You have to leave a message and they have to call, email or text you back. Except they...don't. June 1 was approaching, no tasks were outstanding, I had money down and...I had no idea if anything was happening to get things resolved by this Rivian-imposed deadline. After a few days of trying and failing to get anywhere the service center contacted me directly to say my truck had arrived at Austin and I needed to schedule delivery. Cool. Except I missed that call and needed to call them back. Did you know you also can't call the service center directly either? So I had to leave messages again and wait for someone to respond. Naturally two further days of trying resulted in no response. Well OK, surely I could schedule delivery through the Rivian website using the Schedule Delivery button if we were good to go? Also no. Fuck you. And don't call me Shirley. It was honestly the most frustrating experience I'd ever had trying to buy anything. The family was asking if I was sure I wasn't getting scammed. I was so pissed off that I was ready to cancel the order and stop all payments, because if I couldn't get someone to answer the goddam phone in the span of a week for $80 000, how bad was service going to be?



In the end the service center left me a number on which I could call them back directly and I was able to finally schedule delivery. It didn't happen by June 1st, but I would keep the sale price. Cool. Well sorta cool. I had to give up making any modifications to the order because it was too late. I had wanted 20"" wheels because I didn't like the (lack of) options for the 21"" and wanted the extra sidewall. That had been negotiated with my guide the day after the test drive, but went nowhere because after I put the deposit down I couldn't contact anyone who could sell them to me. So I had to accept the 21"" or cancel the order and get a different truck already fitted with the 20s. I grumbled and carried on. The next week a different guide-person contacted me to say there was a problem with the paperwork. Apparently the state of Texas does not consider an Evidence of Insurance document from my insurer to be proof of insurance. While that's ironic in its absurdity, THAT is what finally got a guide to contact me after two weeks of ignored messages and emails. Glowering at the screen was all I could do.



During that same time I ordered some stuff from the Rivian store including a wall charger. I was in the process of getting a 240V service set up in my garage, but a week after I ordered the thing it still hadn't shipped.  I was going to lose my electrician and needed to know when it was going to ship. Days? Weeks? Tried to contact customer service. Same deal. Email, phone, chat. Could never contact anyone who could tell me anything about the order and the guide people never called, texted or emailed back. Think I ran 0 for 7 attempts over 3 days. Wound up cancelling it through the chat agent, who was left to send the sales people a message, installing a 240V plug in the garage and getting a Grizzl-e off Amazon. Except it shipped anyway and sat with me for two weeks before I got a return label, which I had to somewhat unkindly extort by threatening a chargeback. That $800 is still out of pocket.



I didn't even have the truck yet and I was getting a sinking feeling. This was not the way a well-run company operates. Or as my father more diplomatically put it when discussing the situation 'What sort of fucked up shit-show is this?' You can call it being dramatic in the heat of the moment, but I have no kind words for that whole experience. It took all I had to just not be a dick to the people in the call center and chats trying to get through to someone, because it wasn't like it was specifically their fault nobody was ever responding.



**Chapter 3: A Small World With Ice Cream and Rainbows**



A blazing hot weekend it was finally my time. I live a long way from the service center and paid the $1000 to have it delivered to me. Some of you have asked about the Third Party Carrier option and, uh, that's not what I requested but I think that's what I got. A dude with a 60ft trailer with my Rivian and a Cadillac showed up. Dropped it off, did the initial inspection, signed the papers and off he went to make his final stop. I had expected a Rivian rep to be there to do the whole initial setup since that was part of the package but wound up fumbling through the interface over the phone instead. I get the impression what you get with that delivery option depends on how convenient it is for a service center person to go to you. 



I logged a few cosmetic issues. Some little paint defects and a panel alignment issue. I had been led to expect this sort of thing and booked an appointment to get a mobile service guy to eventually fix it. No big deal. I'd read about the busted tonneau cover issue and asked specifically about it when scheduling delivery, because mine had one or was supposed to. The service center had told me my powered tonneau cover wasn't going to come installed and mobile service would fix it later. I'd offered to just take the money back and forget about it, but I was talked back into it by the service center manager because I was apparently getting a fantastic deal with my as-ordered pricing. However when the truck showed up, there it was. I read lots of stories of people still waiting for theirs and I can only imagine if the service centers have any on-hand there's a push to get new vehicles shipping with them installed rather than creating an ever-deepening backlog for mobile service.



After I had spent some hours with the interface and setting everything up, it was time for the inaugural drive. Pile in with visiting family and go cruising around the side streets of small town Texas trying to get used to the regen braking. I pulled up to a stop light. Some dude in a lifted truck rolls up beside, gives me the sign of the horns and I roll down the window. Rivian fuck yeah. Turns out his kid works at the plant in Normal and had a hand in building it somewhere. That sort of poetic cooincidence feels impossible but...it's a small world sometimes. I decide to take it on the highway to a quiet 75mph area and go to a turnaround in the median. Austin traffic meant I couldn't actually do a real test on the demo. Floor it from a rolling stop up to 75. I don't know what sort of goofy grin was plastered on my face at the time, but there was definitely someone saying 'Holy shit'. Maybe SUV and truck people are easy to impress that way, but even a dual motor has almost double the HP and double the torque of any V8 vehicle we've collectively had before. I dunno what people do with 800 HP quads. It's probably fun. Maybe a little suicidal. The trip ends in ice cream. It's delicious. Slap a rainbow on that happy mental image of heading on back home with the afternoon sun behind us. I spend the next week taking it to work as my new daily driver. As the first one any of my coworkers have been able to get close to, naturally there's a lot of interest and gushing over how nice it is.



It was here. I was happy with it. I could forgive the ordeal of the purchasing process.



**Chapter 4: Fuck.** 



At the end of day 8 of ownership while on a run to the store a strange symbol appears on the driver's display. I didn't know what it specifically meant and there's no image of the specific one in the manual, but I know it's a System Failure and that's decidedly not good. I do the soft reset and it clears. Since it's got these up/down arrows I test changing the suspension mode. Service Air Suspension Soon. Uh oh. More symbols pop up. The blind monitoring sensors are down. The emergency braking is out. Cross-traffic whatever warning is down. The parking sensors aren't working. I get it home without incident and call roadside assistance. It's after dark and I still manage to get someone within 5 minutes. They walk me through resetting it both the hard and soft ways. Doesn't work. My air suspension is out and for whatever reason it also knocks out all my exterior sensors if I touch a button to change modes. The sensors work so long as I don't drive anywhere and don't push a suspension button. But on the second reset my key fob stops working too. That's bad. Reset it again. A half hour session ends with roadside assistance committing to get hold of the service center in the morning to see if they can get a mobile tech to go triage it, but in the meantime so long as it's not making scary sounds it should be OK to drive. I make a point to log everything that seems to have a problem under a ticket, including my original cosmetic stuff.

[Probably not good. ](https://preview.redd.it/yllyat3f3lad1.jpg?width=1008&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=01b881fa03bcdc396bf231d95bca4d3a7ffb751b)

I test it on the following day since I'd read that a deep sleep can fix electronic ailments. Starting it up and we're clear! But after driving for a minute it's back. The air suspension is dead, though it's still holding air. After getting it home again I decide to get it up on some ramps and look underneath to see if I can see any loose connections because this doesn't make a lot of sense as a mechanical problem. Except one of my wheels is covered in grease. Inside all over the wheel, flung onto the wheel well, globs sitting on the control arms. Probably coming from the CV joint boot but I can't see where. Call roadside assistance again to tell them there's a new problem. I already know mobile service won't be able to fix that and they naturally confirm that. It's got to go back 250 miles to Austin. There's no questioning when I tell them I'm not driving it with all these things going on and a tow is arranged. The R1T sulks in my garage for the three days it takes for someone to pick it up and away it goes. As the truck leaves my neighborhood the heavens open up and it starts pouring rain. It's a metaphor and also a cosmic insult because I'd washed only a few days before. By hand. With distilled water.

[Well, fuck.](https://preview.redd.it/ww9cf6w73lad1.jpg?width=1104&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=c320f56197aba103d4b73be708a18e2b7caa762d)

The intervening days are spent wondering if I had made an enormous mistake. Rational me makes the argument that statistically most defective parts are going to fail early if they fail at all during the warranty period. You can look it up if you're skeptical, it mostly comes from articles talking about how extended warranty and protection plans for consumer electronics are bullshit. I can forgive a hole in a rubber CV boot as being a dumb simple thing and the rest seemed to be some electronic problem. Buut this was not just a one-thing problem. I had gambled that buying a late-vin Gen 1 meant that it'd be the most reliable Gen 1 possible and I'd be able to get away with mobile service for years before I had to take it to a service center for something major. Certainly not before the San Antonio service center opened up. I'm straight up not sure my whole scheme was well-founded. The mind consumes itself with doubt. How many times would this happen? Would this thing be unmaintanable outside warranty? Aaaaaaaa. Days and days of Aaaaaaa and the occasional person trying to reassure me that it might be these initial things shaking out and nothing more. Even if 1% of trucks have some sort of major problem that's still \~300 of them. Statistically if an arbitrary 5% of R1Ts had one of these problems out of the box, the odds of one with three is 0.0125% and there would be about...four R1Ts like this out of 30-odd thousand. Hard to quantify without data though. There were maybe low double digit horror stories on reddit. Many of those were old ones from 2022 and were probably exactly what I looked to avoid. There was hope. But Aaaaaaaa. Do you know what happens when you overthink everything? Aaaaaaa!



Roadside assistance tells me that the cost of the tow is going to show up as an invoice and be removed after if they diagnose and find a warrantable defect. OK whatever, until they tell me it's $1800. After I tell them I am most definitely not even potentially accepting any tow charges because I've had it for one week, the tune changes. Let's just get that taken care of. I am asked if I need a rental or a loaner and I opt to make a deal that's more convenient for me. Bring my truck back to me so I don't have to take a day off work and drive for 8 hours and I'll make do without a rental. Accepted. Regardless a few days later I still get an email asking me to approve an $1800 estimate through docusign before proceeding with any work. It's that tow charge. Nooooope. After a call to rivian service to ask wtf they tell me they'll sort it out with the service center. The service center calls the next day saying there was a miscommunication. Balance reduced to 0. New work order states a new half shaft/CV joint and a new air compressor. Alright then.



I see the odometer move over the days following its arrival. Communication is intermittent and clumsy but it's somewhat my fault. Unlike the purchasing process when I call I do actually get connected with someone at the service center if it's during its operating hours. But they still have to call me back with answers to my questions. Some days go by and apparently I am responded to on the Rivian app instead of the phone call I was expecting, which I didn't even know was a thing. After it had been there five days with a weekend in between, some info on what was wrong was trickling out. There was a blocked valve in the air suspension and there was a hole in the CV joint boot as I suspected and those got fixed. They weren't done though. They were chasing everything I'd logged because that's what I asked them to do. As we close in on the end of two weeks paint wasn't finished yet and they'd had to drag a Rivian engineer in because I'd asked them to look at a weird thing I noticed with my rear disconnect and tripped over a bigger, or at least more difficult problem. From what I'd read in all purpose mode it should have been running on just the front motor at least some of the time. I was suspicious because my highway efficiency wasn't very good and I was trying to figure out why. Mine was like it was stuck in sport mode all the time, with the rear-wheel power bias and both motors always being engaged every time I looked at the wheel power display. I didn't even have sport mode and the ride height was forever set to medium. Maybe one day, sport mode, but not now. No errors had ever popped up but I'd read if the disconnect wasn't working eventually it would take out the whole drive unit, so I figured I'd tell them so they could check it and tell me I was being paranoid. The question is what sort of luck do you call it- Bad that it happened at all or good that it was caught early?



So...8 days on the road and I'd lost a valve, a CV boot and apparently my rear drive unit. If you've gotten this far and noticed I said nothing about the sensors, this is the part where I tell you I only have a vague idea of what is going on there but that needed no further attention. The answer I was given was that those sensors were on the same bus as something to do with the air suspension, I suppose this blocked valve, and they're connected in series such that if one thing dies it takes out everything on that bus. I can only imagine it has to be some sort of circuit fault protection since the sensors and the like worked every time until the suspension system failure came up on the dash. I haven't any idea what went on with the rear drive unit. I'd like to know. They've been trying to figure it out for more than a week. That spare tire I asked for is in there at least.



**Chapter 5: The Undiscovered Country Is Not On Google Maps**

So that brings us to the present. I didn't expect things to go this sideways and I've been puzzling over what exactly to do, or if I should do anything. I have taken the opportunity to read up on the lemon laws. I've been thinking about what exactly it would mean to exercise it if something of this magnitude happened again (because if this or even something similar happened again it would qualify just based on days out of service). Thing is I'm not looking for a reason to wash my hands of Rivian, get rid of the R1T and walk away altogether. Maybe most people wouldn't be this patient because, yeaaaah, this isn't how it's supposed to go, but I find I still want what they're offering. The engineering is good, I like what I'm getting for the money. Don't get me wrong, it's a lot of money. However I get the impression more of that money is going to the mechanical bits you can't see and there's probably more going on there than people realize. If I was being honest, I was more surprised when I crawled under the thing than on the demo. Because who gets under a vehicle during a test drive? With the aero covers on you can't actually see any of the suspension from the outside. Sliding on a piece of cardboard and looking up for the first time...are those forged aluminum control arms? Huh. There's a lot of aluminum down here. So shiny. So clean. So little exposed undercarriage...Uh, anyway.

Rivian as an organization seems to be very compartmentalized with a lot of self-inflicted problems with what I can only guess is understaffing in their sales support roles, while being just fine or better than most in terms of things like roadside assistance. I get the impression they planned their sales force around the pre-order stage where things would happen slowly over weeks or months as things rolled out of the factory and it broke down pretty hard in the big 2024 push when things needed to happen fast with a lot of inventory. I don't have a service center horror story. They're actually doing pretty good by the metrics of every mechanic I've used in the past. I have a blacklist exclusively populated with dealerships. The independent mechanics I trust tend to have backlogs a week or more deep because being good around here means being busy. Waiting for warranty work is a bad look and it happens elsewhere, but that didn't happen for me. Roadside assistance was easy to get a hold of even after-hours, called back when they said they would and I later found left detailed notes for the service center while they were doing their thing. 

I just need to settle with the worries about future reliability. The details are complicated, because even with the major OEMs newest is not always best. I ask myself if I did get a different R1T out of some lemon situationn, would it neccessarily have better odds than this one? I can't sidestep that this seems to be an unreasonable number of problems from the factory, but it is entirely possible that this is one of those rare cases of godawful luck. The question boils down to if it's like that old addage about a plane crash survivor being safe to travel with because the odds of that shit happening twice would be incredible...or if it means this particular vehicle is cursed. As numerous as the problems were, it was towed and covered under warranty, it didn't sit at the service center for weeks waiting in line. My plan was actually to love and cherish this machine for at least a decade and in that I thought I'd stacked my odds on getting the most refined, bug-free sort within reach. I'm sure a lot of people are going to say 'This is why I leased' and it's not a bad strategy if you're the sort that perpetually turns over vehicles every few years. I found that leasing wouldn't save me any money so I didn't do it. The whole depreciation hit from the Gen 2 refresh didn't factor in either because I was planning for the long haul. 

At this moment I'm not bitter about having gone for a 24 when I did. A Gen 2 R1T with everything I presently have would cost me somewhere around another $8750 and I'd still be losing something on the battery because new large is not the same as old large. $3750 of that would be the loss of the EV credit for going over the limit and the rest is price changes in the various options and things that were on sale no longer being on sale. I think I'm willing to accept the loss in the new shininess for the amount of money saved. I missed the F&F discount by taking delivery the week before it was extended to the 2024s. Yeah, that one sucks. The thing that would make me bitter was if the Gen 2 was an objectively better vehicle in terms of its long-term durability and I don't think anyone will be able to quantify that for years. 

That brings us to the end, though not for me. I still don't have my truck back. There will probably be updates, depending on what happens at the end of all this."

Unreliable?
Went camping - Rivian broke down.  Nice rental.  Tried to take the kids on a hike - Rivian broke down.  Is it just me or are there more people out there having similar repeated problems with their adventure vehicle?  (Critical Battery Failure, Electical Hazard - last time they said it was the HVAC, replaced it, same thing happened).  "

Christening the New R1T on the Black Rock Playa (NV), with some Thoughts on Off-Roading, Adventuring, and Camping
Hello Everyone! We took our new R1T out to the Black Rock Playa (Burning Man location) for Memorial day, and I thought I'd share some thoughts on it's performance over the course of 3 days in a particularly remote location. It'll be a doozy of a writeup, but I'll try to break it down for anyone else that is interested in specifics and is wary of taking a \~$90,000 vehicle off the pavement. For comparison, we've got a Leased 2024 R1T Quad with 21's and the large pack, with just under 1000 miles at the beginning of the trip. 

(TL,DR: 90 miles out to the Playa, Napier Bed Tent review, 100 mile excursion, blown tire on a gravel road with repair, solar top-off from RV, then conserve mode 90 miles back)

https://preview.redd.it/quua76zkn93d1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3c410d83a47da8a9a4489792a8bdc1edd240ada6

  
**Getting out there:** 

We started the weekend on Saturday morning and topped off to 100% (316 miles, All Purpose) at the closest Charger to the Black Rock Desert, which was 90 miles away at the Electrify America in Fernley, NV. After a mostly uneventful drive to the campsite, we posted up and made camp with some family that had brought an RV all decked out with Solar (More on this later...) and numerous other tents/vans. In All Purpose and mostly driving like a grandma, efficiency was about 2.2 M/kWh and we arrived with about 220 miles remaining.

  
**Camping in the Rivian:**

We purchased a Napier Backroadz Truck Bed Tent for a previous vehicle last year, and I was eager to see how the smaller version of the tent would fit in the R1T. After searching a few other posts, and measuring everything up. the smallest size of the tent (Compact-Short Bed) fits like a champ. It does take a little bit of finagling, and at the advice of another Redditor, some carabiners to connect some of the straps inside the gear tunnel. But it fit just fine, and with the tailgate down, gave us more than enough length for the tent and to sleep. As it turns out, the R1T bed is exactly the right size to fit a Full or Double size mattress. We decided to go with a 6 inch tri-fold memory foam mattress for comfort instead of an air mattress, but either will fit. The folded mattress takes up exactly half the bed during travel, leaving plenty of room for chairs, coolers, etc. and was fantastic for comfort. It was a little tight in the bed with myself (6'4"", 300) my Wife (5'8"", 130) and the 90lb chocolate lab, but any combination of the two of us would have been perfectly fine. And even all three was some of the most comfortable car camping I've done.

As it pertains to Camp Mode and Power usage, it took a while for my big wrinkly brain to figure out that Camp Courtesy was the setting that stopped Proximity Lock/Unlock. So for the first 6 or so hours, it would regularly unlock and light up the whole Playa until I finally read the manual and found the Camp Courtesy mode section. After that, it worked like a champ, stayed perfectly level, and lost very little to Vampire Drain. Even with the 6 hour SNAFU, it only lost about 4 miles between Noon Saturday and about 10 A.M. Sunday.

**Off-Road Excursion:**

We ended up leaving on Sunday morning to visit Double Hot Springs and Clapper Canyon, about 100 miles round trip back to the campsite. In all my calculating and planning, I wanted to be back at the campsite with about 110 miles remaining to get to the charger in Fernley. I wasn't sure about the efficiency while driving off the pavement and at varying speeds, so I had planned to bail out early if it looked like we weren't going to make it back with at least 110 miles. 

Our convoy of 2 Jeeps, a lifted Subaru Baja, and the R1T went bombing across the Playa at about 80 MPH for the first 30 miles to make it to the hot springs. For those that have never been to the Black Rock, it's an expanse of about 1000 square miles of Alkali Desert. Extremely flat, insanely dusty, and not unlike every desolate planet you've ever seen in a science fiction movie. The baked top ""Crust"" usually cracks under the weight of vehicles and leaves tire tracks all the way across the desert, but the Rivian didn't seem to sink noticeably further than any of the other vehicles. It did suck down some extra juice though, at about 1.8 M/kWh in All Purpose, we arrived on the other side of the playa with about 160 miles. Which means we burnt through about 50 miles of range traveling only 30 miles. But we carried on! 

As an aside here, the amount of dust on the Playa is astounding, and the Rivian did an excellent job of keeping as much out as it could. The ""Waterproof"" compartments (Frunk, Tunnel, Under bed, and Cab) all did a perfect job at keeping the dust out. We kept the newest generation power Tonneau closed with some hope that maybe it would keep some out of the bed, and that was a mistake. The bed was coated with about 1/2 inch of dust, and I later learned the Tonneau was not going to open with all the crap in the slats (more on that later). But for anyone looking at going somewhere super dusty, keep the Tonneau open and put all the stuff you don't want coated in crud in the waterproof compartments.

The next 40ish miles were going to be two-tracker dirt roads. Nothing super difficult, but no faster than about 30 MPH, and most of it less than 20. The Rivian did great! We used All Terrain, and switched a few times between highest and high ride height. Like I said, not Imogene or Rubicon level difficulty, but there were a few places that required some care to not scrape a bumper or ding a door. The approach and departure angles allowed us to traverse a few washes that I would have had to get creative with in a longer truck. The front facing cameras were fantastic to see what was coming without having to guess, although, I don't think I'd do any legitimate Rock Crawling without a spotter just using the cameras. They're decent quality to see where a dip or rock is, but not nearly good enough for me to trust completely on anything gnarly.

We trucked our way along and got some very funny looks from a few other passers-by, keeping up with the two Jeeps just fine. It was as we were beginning to turn the corner on the loop back around to the campsite that things started getting a little worrisome. The road we had intended to take had been completely wiped out by some heavy rain last year, and required a nigh on 20 mile detour to go around. At this point, the range anxiety was not great, and I was coming up with contingencies on how to get home. During this stretch of the excursion, we got about 1.4 M/kWh, which was worse than I had hoped, but about what I expected. The detour led us to a very nicely maintained gravel road, so I was confident that we would be able to get better efficiency than we had been getting, and I ended up putting it into conserve and cruising along at about 40MPH. It was about 30 miles back to camp and 90 back to the charger after that, and the range with Conserve mode showed about 130 miles, which was not exactly ideal, but we could probably squeak back to the charger if nothing changed. 

https://preview.redd.it/1ceua0zun93d1.jpg?width=4000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=aa68e7d911c9a2fb6e15465bf37f43abdfbfa476

We were in the back of the convoy as we moved along down the gravel road, when a notification popped up on the screen. ""Check Tire Pressure"", and sure enough, the rear drivers side tire was down at 41PSI and dropping rapidly. We rolled to a stop and hopped out to see what the damage was.

  
**Tire Repair:**

Lo, and behold, there was a tear of about 1/4 inch in the crown of the left rear tire. and I could hear and feel the air escaping. Unfortunately, I didn't have a spare tire, but our delivery guy had mentioned that the compressor bag in the gear tunnel door had a repair kit. So I broke out the bag, and followed the instructions on the TireJect kit. It involved removing the valve stem core with the included tool, squeezing in about 10 Oz of the rubber/Kevlar mix, then inflating the tire and rolling forward a few feet to coat the inside of the tire. I was wholly unconvinced of this working, because I've had very little luck with similar products in the past, and the hole was fairly significant. But, without much of a choice, and in about 10 minutes, it worked exactly as advertised. We used the on-board compressor to fill up to 48PSI, rolled forward about 20 feet, then topped off the tire again, and it worked like a charm. I cannot express how easy, and how well this product worked. It really saved our bacon, because getting a tow truck out there would have been a nightmare, and leaving to get a new tire wouldn't have been much better. Save for having a spare tire, I couldn't ask for a better solution for when you're 100+ miles from civilization. Props to Rivian for finding this product and including a legitimate lifeline in lieu of a spare. It didn't lose a single PSI during the ensuing dirt road drive nor the 150 mile pavement drive all the way home.

  
**Meanwhile, Back at the Ranch:**

We made it back to the campsite with exactly 82 miles. That was in Conserve, driving as gently as possible both for the tire integrity and for range consumption. Unfortunately, the closest charger was exactly 90 miles away. Even in Conserve, we very probably wouldn't make it. Luckily, as part of their retirement plans, my parents are working on their Off-Grid RV and Utility Trailer, complete with a solar array and 11kWh battery. They offered to let us plug into their fully charged solar battery (albeit 110V, 20 Amp) and stay out another unplanned night. From about 6 P.M. to about 10 A.M., the battery (and solar in the morning) charged us up to 110 miles at an average of 1.1 kW. If they had a second inverter hooked up, we would have been able to use the 240 travel charger and drain that battery in about 1.5 hours. But, as it was, we spent another evening out on the Playa and trickle charged the car.

https://preview.redd.it/455nmcxxn93d1.jpg?width=3000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ca4de257c535cc1c36588029c605807f708d229

  
**The Drive Home:**

We left it in Conserve for the 90 mile return trip Monday morning. I had intended to open the Tonneau to let some of the dust blow out of the bed. I blew out the individual slat joints and the track on either side of the bed with a separate compressor , but when I pushed the button to retract the cover, it moved about 6 inches and stopped. Knowing the reputation the old Tonneaus had, I quickly abandoned that idea and waited till we got somewhere I could brush out the excess and clean the tracks more thoroughly. 

We rolled into the Electrify America charger in Fernley with 11 miles and 2%, averaging 2.6 M/kWh for the drive. The tire held up beautifully, and we quickly charged up to 80% for the remaining drive home to Reno. 

We stopped off at a car wash and spent a great deal of time spraying down the remaining dust, dirt, grime, and bug guts off. After a thorough spraying of the Tonneau slats and rails, it retracted just fine! No issues, no grinding, and cleaned up great. Yet another testament to Rivian's engineers knowing in the re-design when to quit forcing the moving parts.

  
**The Conclusion:**

It was a fantastic trip out! We got to explore a great deal of the operating envelope for the R1T. It was a super comfortable drive, both on and off road, and handled most of the trip like a champ! The vehicle itself worked exactly as advertised. The Camp Speaker was fantastic, Camp Mode and Leveling made for a great place to sleep, and the bed tent was a much more affordable way to camp rather than a $2000 dollar Roof Top Tent.

The downfalls were really more issues with the current (Ha!) charging infrastructure, and us pushing the limits of range without making a whole lot of concessions in comfort. We kept the windows down when it was comfortable to do so, but ran the AC for a good chunk of the trip, and could have turned back from the excursion early. The truck did as good as I could have expected, but a Rivian Adventure Network Charger in Gerlach, NV (the closest settlement) would have alleviated almost all of our issues, save the blown tire. Unfortunately, that seems to just be a byproduct of heavy truck+high tire pressure. I'm not convinced the 20"" Off-Road tires would have done any better, but maybe a more aggressive tread would have stopped whatever rock punched the hole. In any case, the TireJect kit in conjunction with the onboard compressor worked beautifully and got us all the way back to the RV and then on to the charger and home. 

I'm excited to keep adventuring in our truck! I would be ok to head back out to the Black Rock, but keep the excursions out there to a much shorter route. We were lucky to have a 11kWh top-up, but without that, we would very likely have been screwed. For anyone wanting to know how Rivians do off-road, they're fantastic! But keep in mind that the range calculations are estimates, and your efficiency will probably be lower than on the pavement, so build bigger buffers for your range calculations, especially if you're exploring the more remote parts of the world. Thanks for reading this far everyone! Happy Adventuring!

Conveyor Equipment Fire at Rivian Automotive Plant
[Source - Normal Fire Department (Normal, IL) - via Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/NormalFire/posts/823921513106783?ref=embed_post)

A fire under a section of assembly line conveyor resulted in the evacuation of the Rivian Automotive Assembly Plant late this morning.

Normal Firefighters were already at the Rivian property for an unrelated incident when the fire broke out at around 11:30 this morning.  Firefighters made quick use of fire extinguishers and knocked the fire down until additional fire personnel arrived to assist.  Employees were evacuated safely from the building.  One employee was treated for minor smoke inhalation, but declined transportation to a hospital.  

The fire began under a section of conveyor that moves the vehicle chassis down the assembly line on the western side of the building.  The exact cause of the fire is under investigation.  The fire did not involve a vehicle or battery components.   The fire damage was contained to the area where it began.   

Due to the size of the facility, it took an extended amount of time to ventilate the smoke from the building.  Air quality tests were performed to ensure that the air was safe to breathe as firefighters finished operations inside the building. 

Control of the building was turned over to Rivian just after 1:00 p.m. and employees were permitted to return to the building.

Bloomington Fire Department assisted with an ambulance and an engine company, and off-duty Normal firefighters were called back to be available for any additional calls in the Town of Normal during this incident.

A damage estimate is not available."

R1S Broke day of pickup.
Hey all, waited to write this up until it was all resolved, you may have seen my first post titled ""timeline for anyone asking"" linked below but the day i picked my R1S up it broke 30 min away from the Bellevue service center. They were very helpful and rushed to get me in and I'm stoked to finally be driving it but below is the timeline of what happened as well as a TLDR. (very bottom has screenshot of service PDF for those curious)

&#x200B;

 [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1bfhqta/timeline\_for\_anyone\_asking/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1bfhqta/timeline_for_anyone_asking/)

  
\- Picked up 3/18 at the Bellevue service center.  
\- Went through all steps with guide changed drive modes all the fun stuff.  
\- Driving home 20 min away from service center hit a pothole in driver plus.  
\- Started beeping take control service suspension tons of service error lights lit up across the bottom of the driver screen.  
\- Went into limp mode pulled over.  
\- Did the left button hazard lights reset to send diagnostic.  
\- Wife called Rivian service while it was restarting as i was the one driving less then 30 seconds someone answered. (great to get an answer so fast)  
\- Service asked me to do the restart i already did once it restarted all errors were gone.  
\- got backup to speed on the highway service tech said hes going to stay on the phone for the next 10-15 min to make sure.  
\- Went to try and change drive modes and it wouldn't let me said can't change drive modes until serviced.  
\- Service tech transferred us to the technician at the service center we just left he took all the information and asked us to drive it back if we could.  
\- Started driving back 3 blocks from the service center hit another bump went into limp mode again.  
\- pulled it in in limp mode dropped it off they gave us a R1T loaner. (quad/Rivian blue/ocean coast)  
\- 3/19 got call from service center diagnostics were run and all signs point to a wiring issue and they are hoping 3/20 to get into it and start chasing down wires to see if its a short or something.  
\- 3/21 go phone call that there is an integrated braking module connector every time they push on a specific wire it causes errors in the car. The connector looks good pins look good so they are leaning towards a bad brake booster in the master cylinder (not sure exactly what that is) and ordered the part and it should be there that day or the next.  
\- 3/22 got call part was installed and everything works can now pick it up   
\- 3/23 picked up everything works and can't wait to finally get out and drive it. (below is screenshot of service PDF)

R1S: Where does liquid spilled in the cargo area go?
On the way home from an extreme adventuring trip to Costco, two bottles of wine collided in the back of my R1S and broke (white, thank god).  After getting home, I’ve got some damp carpet but appear to be missing the vast majority of this 1.5L of liquid.  As I’m parked, it looks like some is dripping out behind one of the rear tire.  Question is, is this an intentional drainage channel or do I just have liquid seeped down onto everything in the structure?  Given the intended purpose of the vehicle I’m really hoping it’s the former.

Bonus points for tips on cleaning.  Thinking portable shampooer."

Request: Allow the owner to override errors and limitations.
Similar to other posts here, we should have the ability to choose to ignore various errors depending on their severity. 

A fender bender causes the side tunnel door to indicate as ""open"" when it's clearly closed? Override and drive her home.

A spilled coffee shorts the hood sensor? Override and drive to service center.

Want to have two dudes surfing on your gear doors? Override that thang.

Listen I get the whole liability thing and trying to both keep people safe and not allow further damage to occur, but at some point these vehicles will get older and break down and anyone with an old truck can attest that sometimes you just drive it broke. Would love to have an option that allows me to accept the risk/liability and continue with vehicle operations."

Post Purchase Experience
I’ve commented a few times here about some of the struggles with my truck and wanted to recap where I am currently. Reservation placed at some point in 2022, shop access mid sep ‘23, delivery 9/30/23. Bellevue, WA SC. 

Guide between reservation and pickup was incredibly pushy to sign and process paperwork. Most likely due to EOQ. Totally get it. Got access, saved my config, and immediately hit up for my down payment (40k). 

Took delivery Saturday 9/30. The Bellevue SC was so swamped we were directed to the truck and essentially let go. Easy set up. Had a couple fumbles where the gps didn’t recognize where the truck was for about 10 minutes. Then off to the races. 

Driving to an appointment either Monday or Tuesday, had an aggressively hard ride and an error that the air suspension didn’t work. Pulled over, called support and did a hard reset on the truck. Pulled into a drive thru and could hear the suspension trying to fill. Called service and they offered to tow the truck. Since it was on my way home from an appointment, dropped it off myself. Ended up driving on flat airbags about 20 miles. The roughest ride I have ever experienced in a car. 

Dropped off, offered to just Uber home as the SC didn’t have any loaners. They offered a Lyft credit, which I accepted. Took 2-3 days to fix. Picked up on Oct 5th. 

Dropped the truck off to get windows tinted and PPF applied on 10/9. Picked up on 10/11. 

Error and turtle mode on 10/12. Called Rivian service, they asked me to do a full vehicle reset. That fixed the issue. It occurred a day later or so? Called service again, they told me to reset it. Resolved. Happened again a day later and told them to take it in, even though they couldn’t promise an appointment.  

Brought the truck in 10/16. Techs diagnosed the issue on 10/17 as a rear drive unit issue. A loaner came in a day or two later that I picked up. Parts and repair took until 11/3. I was out of town and picked up the truck on 11/6. Ended up having that loaner long enough to need to pick up hard plates (from the temps). 

The first time driving the truck after a long sleep at home, it had a horrible shudder when I went into drive. Chalked up to oddness. Had the shudder occur a couple more times and go into turtle mode. Reset it and it would go away for a few hours or so. Finally on 11/9, violently shoot at a stop light. Called service and told them I would be driving it to the SC and dropping it off so they could see the issue and error. 

Dropped the truck off and got a rental from enterprise. 

By 11/13, they had not been able to reproduce the shudder but had seen the issue. I think I ended up picking up the truck, having the issue occur again the next morning, and brought it right back. 

Got another rental (this time an R1S from enterprise). They trandgerrred my truck to a different service center on 11/16 saying a tech there might know the issue. On 11/17 they said they found the issue and had a loaner truck available. Swapped out the rental for a loaner and they started the repair. 

From the tech, that repair was because the original rear drive unit replacement (or repair) had the wrong firmware, causing the front and the back to not agree on how to drive together. By this point (11/17) the issue was escalated to engineering in Normal (I believe). 

On 12/8, got told by the service center that they had finished the repair, but while aligning the truck they found they broke a spring and that needed to be replaced. 

In 12/9 the SC called and said they found a chip in the windshield and needed to replace it. We scheduled a pickup for the truck on 12/14. They also offered to mount my winter tires/wheels (which was super awesome of them)

I called them on 12/12 and asked if we could do a pickup on 12/13 due to scheduling (I had told them I was scheduled to go on a road trip 12/15 when it went in for service in November). They were able to shuffle it around. It ended up being pushed to 12/14. When I went to pick up, the truck needed additional calibration with the new tires, so I left it for 2 hours and came back. 

Finally picked up the truck on 12/14, took it home. Turned around and left on my road trip 12/15. Everything worked great until about 4 hours into the drive when the HVAC stopped working (stopped blowing any air)

Charged the truck for 20 minutes and HVAC started working again on the next drive, no change to the truck. 

That’s where we are now. I’m about 5 hours from home. Driving back tomorrow. Fingers crossed the HVAC works. Driving through snowy passes with no defrosting was not the.. best. 

I will say, through all of this, the SC staff have been understanding and kind. I’ve been waiting for over 30 days for legal to respond to my Lemon request. The SC has covered the first payment and is working on covering the second (both payments happened while the truck was in their service). 

It’s a bummer because I really love the truck. And if they lemon it, I’m probably out the PPF and tint cost I already spent. 

Still a fan. Just want a working truck."

Tie Rod Reinforcements
I was watching a youtube video, Matt’s Off-Road Recovery, and they recovered a bronco using something called a broncbuster tie rod reinforcement. It basically looked like a big thick CNC machined clamp that clamped down on the broken tie rod, and allowed the broken Ford Bronco to drive itself out. They said clamps could also be used proactively to prevent a broke tie rod in the first place. I’ve seen several Rivians with broken tie rods (on the internet), does anyone know if anyone is making a product like this for our Rivians? The product looks to be vehicle/tie rod specific."

Motor Fault [Update]
See original thread [here](https://reddit.com/r/Rivian/s/g0A1qFdvD9). 

Well…….two weeks at the Chicago service center, and I still know very little about the status of my R1S. After placing multiple calls this week, I received a return call on Wednesday.  I was promised return calls Monday/Tuesday, third day was my lucky day!

They have still been unable to replicate the motor fault error message (as it cleared), but know they haven’t driven it since last week.  Apparently the engineering team asked them to send in fluid, they’re awaiting those results, and still need to do an extended (60-70 mile) drive to try and replicate the error.  Apparently the engineering team would have to sign off on a rear drive unit replacement. 

So once that is approved, it would likely be another week minimum.  After which they’ll tend to my existing delivery issues, including some paint issues which would require a multi-week (they suggested three weeks) visit to their body shop partner. Communication during that phase would be even worse, as all communication is done between the service center and partner body shop.  

I expressed concern over the lack of information, they committed to providing an update Friday (yesterday) or today…..shockingly crickets. 

All in all, I received my R1S in mid-August, broke down by end of September, and I’ll be lucky to have it by November. Rivian service has been less than stellar from a communication perspective. Lots of promises of better communication, yet zero execution. 

I’m very hopeful they’ll improve the service experience, I can’t wish it upon anyone. I don’t think it is unrealistic to assign a service advisor, at least for major issues, that can provide routine updates proactively…..at the very least, be able to articulate a diagnosis after two weeks!"

Unsolved vibration at highway speeds
I'm at 6k miles on my R1S delivered back in May.  When I first received it, it vibrated at highway speeds (wheel shake as others have posted).  Rivian service said it would smooth out with time as the tires broke in.  It was also misaligned, which they fixed at service a couple months after delivery.  Now at 5k miles I did my first rotation and balance at Discount Tire.  That did not fix the vibration.  So I talked to Discount and they said bring it back and we'll do road force balancing.  They found two tires high at 35-40 pounds, one at 18, and the other inbetween.  They remounted the tire matched to the wheel and got all four tires down to about 18 (they didn't touch the 4th tire).  Problem is, the vibration didn't change.  What to do now?  It's an unacceptable drive quality for the price of the ride.  Drive heights don't change things.  22"" wheels.  Just put in another service ticket (Phoenix)....  next appt after Christmas, ugh.  "

R1S vs other vehicles as a family hauler
Back in early 2022, my family and I decided to put down a pre-order on an R1S. We got really lucky to lock in the pre-hike price, for about a $77K MSRP cost (minus $3500 tax credit so about $73.5K), significantly more than any other vehicle we’ve both ever purchased. After my wife’s car recently went caput and our family growing in the next few months, we’ve been really contemplating on ditching the pre-order and getting something more economical, but it seems like there’s a lot of problems ongoing in the car market right now based on this sub like..

1. Many cars that are lesser quality are going for around $70K now with top trims.
2. Used car market is still shit. Can’t find anything close by for most of our criteria.
3. Many new cars that we’d consider (PHEV, Hybrid AWD 3-Row SUV or minivan) are pretty much just as expensive, and also have a wait list (Lincoln Aviator, Volvo XC90, Toyota Sienna Hybrid), etc. 

I’m also considering not going full EV yet because this vehicle would also be our primary road trip car as well, and I don’t trust the charging networks enough yet  (especially around the Midwest vs West Coast where we used to live) based on what I hear from this and other subs. PHEV seems like a great middle road option, but their batteries also seem too small for its own good. Should we get something ‘lesser’ value instead? I understand this forum is mostly advocates of Rivian, and I’ve been there since day 1, but my perspective shifted once we were having a kiddo and the other car broke down.. 

For folks with a Rivian and chose it over another vehicle, how has it been in your opinion for trips, servicing, etc.? Happy to have it with kids and dogs?"

Kneeling mode?
As somebody who recently broke their leg skiing, it got me wondering: how hard is it to get in and out of the Rivian when you’ve got limited mobility? I had a thought that it would be nice if you could get the car to kneel/lean to one side or the other to make entry/egress easier if you’re injured. 

I’m currently in a leg brace and had to sit width-wise across the back seat of my wife’s X3 the other day so I could keep my leg up and straight. When it came time to get out, it was quite the challenge sliding myself out. It was definitely not helped by the fact that we were on a slight incline so I had to push my body uphill to get out the door. It got me thinking; it would have been a lot easier if the seats were angled down towards the door to help me slide out. 

Can the Rivian do anything like that? Like, lift the driver side suspension up while dropping the passenger side down to angle the seats and help sort of dump you out or lower the height of the seat you have to climb up to to get in. This is probably a super esoteric use case feature but also definitely seems like if you ever need it, you’ll be happy it’s there. And if anything, the outdoorsy types they’re marketing to are probably slightly more likely to be injured and in need of a feature like this. I’m no engineer but I’d imagine that if the Rivian can level itself for camp mode, they could easily add an injury leaning/kneeling mode for easier entry/exit. 

If it matters, I have a jan. ‘22 r1s preorder."

Tailgate design flaw (FYI)
Posting this mainly as a PSA. Today I unloaded a heavy palletized load, and to do so we had to drag it out of the dropped tailgate. In doing so it grabbed the upper plastic trim piece on the top of the tailgate (reminder, the tailgate was down), and popped it off. It broke several clips which I am upset about, however I was able to just pop it right back in. Just a slight design flaw that everyone should know about that if you are sliding something out of the tailgate when it is down you may pop this trim piece off. I hope Rivian will fix this in the future with a better tailgate design."

2250 Mile Adventure from NV to CO and Back
I took delivery my R1T about 3 weeks ago, just prior to heading out on an incredible winter trip from Reno, Nevada to Frisco, Colorado. I’ve got a lot of great things to say, some constructive criticism to give, and almost no complaints on my 2250 mile journey through snow and dust and roads. So, sit back and grab a drink, then have a read.
https://i.imgur.com/cKO7BqS.jpg

First, my R1T:

-	Rivian Blue
-	21 inch road tires
-	Roof mounted Thule Ski Box

Cargo:

-	6 pairs of skis
-	500 pounds of cargo (including ice climbing gear and skis)
-	3 people (approx. 450 pounds)

Reno, NV to Salt Lake City, UT:
Temperature: 25-40F
Highway speed: 74 mph
Average mi/kWh: 1.80

It was incredibly easy to stuff most of our gear into the truck, “under bed”, gear tunnel, and bed. We had one weather sensitive trunk in the cab because the manual tonneau covers haven’t yet been shipped. The rest was stored under a tarp and secured with straps. Initially, I tried very hard to store the skis in the bed of the truck, but they wouldn’t fit. There was unwillingness to use ski racks because of concern about road grime, so we opted to use a rocket box.

Overall the truck was really well loaded but the rocket box on top of the roof with the cargo crossbars was going to add some serious wind resistance and noise. I estimate it added 10-12% to our overall energy usage. 

We made three charging stops on the way to Salt Lake City. Number one was in Lovelock Nevada. Stop number two was at Colt Casino, Nevada. South number three was at Wendover, Nevada. All three stations were electrify America, and none of them gave us any trouble. Charge rates vary between 220 and 180 kW. This trip was done pre-update, but I didn’t have any issue with sustained charge rates. At almost every stop the truck was ready to go before we were.

The Salt Lake City stop was a little different, and we encountered some issues with the Electrify America station there. The Rivian would not connect to the new electrify America charge dispenser. I called Rivian support, and they instructed me to restart the vehicle, and that solved the problem. Rivian support is a really strong aspect of the company. They pick up the phone on the first ring and get an answer to your question really fast. Once that had been sorted, we were able to charge at 220 kW again. Overall it was an uneventful and smooth trip that took about 10 1/2 hours.

Salt Lake City, UT to Frisco, CO:
Temperature: 30F
Highway Speed: 72 mph
Average mi/kWh: no data

We took a more leisurely route to get to Frisco Colorado. Our first charging stop was in Provo Utah at a Walmart. The electrify America station here gave us no trouble, but only charge at approximately 170 kW at its peak. There were a lot of other Rivian, pulling in and out at this location, it was a very busy charger.

We then traveled to Price, Utah, where we were able to locate a free ChargePoint, DC charger. The stop wasn’t necessary, but people had to go to the bathroom, and I was happy to put in free power at 80 kW for about 20 minutes.

We stopped at Green River for lunch, put some power in the car here at the Electrify America station, again without issue, and continued on our way to Grand Junction. We charged again in Grand Junction and this time we ran into problems with Electrify America. Two of the stations were out of service, however, in different ways. The first station had a black screen but an operational credit card reader. The second station had an operational screen but the vehicle refused to connect to it. I called electrify America and had them restart the station that wouldn’t connect. Meanwhile, I successfully connected to the station with a dead screen, and continued my charge. Overall this added about 10 minutes to the charge time.

On our way to Frisco, we stopped at Edwards to put in a little bit of power before we arrived. We probably could’ve made it without the stop, but everybody felt more comfortable with a little bit of extra power going up over the pass with very cold temperatures. Again, electrify America, and no issue. The temperature here was about 0°F. It was one of the new style electrify America chargers. It’s hard to know how that bitter cold affects range because we were also climbing a very steep pass at the same time. I can say that I don’t feel the heater was able to keep up without blasting at absolute maximum when it dropped -5F. Perhaps it’s all the glass?

The garage we parked the truck in only had a 120 V outlet, so trickle charging the truck was our only option. It fit really easily into the single car garage.

Frisco, CO to Ouray, CO:
Temperature: 34
Highway Speed: 65 mph
Average mi/kWh: no data

There’s not much to say about this leg of the trip, except we took a winding road from Glenwood Springs to Ouray Colorado by way of Montrose. The Rivian charger in Montrose was outstanding, the location has no useful services. We weren’t driving the vehicle in a sporty way on those mountain passes, because it was laden with so much gear. That being said, it felt so nice to drive this vehicle. On mountain roads, it just feels planted and in control. At the Rivian charger we were able to get about 220 kW until the vehicle reached about 50% power. In most cases, I’ve found that the R1T, if it reaches around 220 from a dispenser, it will sustain that high rate longer than my model 3 sustained 250. It’s just an anecdote, but overall I was impressed with its ability to charge quickly, with such a huge battery.

The hotel we stayed at in Ouray, a Quality Inn, had 2 Tesla Destination Chargers for free, for guests. They need to be turned on by the front desk. With my adapter, they worked no problem. They would enable me to leave Ouray with a 100% charge.

While in town, we got hit with a substantial snowstorm. A couple of notes on ice. If it’s possible to let the cabin warm for long enough, then I found the doorhandles would melt out. Any ice buildup interior to the handle melted in about 20 minutes. They were relatively easy to keep snow free. For the hood of the vehicle, I really recommend clearing off any snow and breaking away any ice as necessary to open the hood before allowing the motor to try and do it itself. I found the gear tunnel doors to be the most problematic. They can be really difficult to open. When they’re covered in ice and snow they sit to flush with the surrounding panels. Because we stored a substantial amount of gear in the gear tunnel we really needed to have this be accessible. As others have pointed out, opening the rear passenger doors makes opening the gear tunnel doors easier in situations like this, but I would appreciate some kind of handle or opening in the panel to make access simpler, in pretty much all cases. It’s hard to open the tunnels with gloved hands.

I was diligent about keeping the bed of the truck shoveled of snow, so there was never any significant buildup of ice and snow in the bed. I used a plastic scraper tool and brush to keep out any snow that might prevent me from getting access to the sub-bed compartment. Surprisingly even with ice and snow getting into the nooks and crannies of the compartment, closing it was still easy. I just stood on the lid and the weight crushed the snow and ice into nothing. It closed without incident.

As for driving dynamics on the 21 road tires in a foot+ of fresh, it was as if it wasn’t even there. No sliding, great traction on hills, even with stops while getting around town. Overall, I’ve owned a good number of vehicles that claim to be good in the snow, this one has handled it the best, and my friends quickly shut up about the Perelli scorpion tires. Snow mode is outstanding. 

I wanna make just a couple of notes on how we use the truck for ice climbing. We stored our heaviest gear, including ice axes, crampons, and ropes in the underbelly of the truck, and it was very easy to get access to these things when we needed them. We used the gear tunnel for our clothing and boots, and when we were putting on gear, the gear tunnel doors made perfect seats for putting on ski boots, climbing boots, prepping backpacks. This left the bed of the truck and the tailgate available for gear organization, rather than a too-high seat. They are the perfect height for putting on boots. I love them. I love them so much.

Ouray, CO to Moab, UT:
Temperature: 15
Highway Speed: 45 mph
Average mi/kWh: 1.65

Still in a snowstorm, this was the most difficult leg of the trip. I tend to drive conservatively in snow and ice conditions so I kept my speed to around 40 to 45 mph on snowy roads. I was being passed by other vehicles at times, but I would prefer not to slide out in a turn or lose control of the vehicle. All that being said, the truck performed perfectly in the snow, and I had no slides, no slips for perhaps 100 miles of heavy snow travel.

Range definitely takes a hit in snow and cold, but the trucks target of reaching Moab Utah, with 50% power, starting at 100%, was spot on.

I can say that this vehicle gets a tremendous amount of ice buildup from the road in temperatures and conditions like this. We needed to stop and break the ice out from underneath the fenders several times. I think this is due to the relatively small amount of clearance between the front and back of the wheel well and the wheel itself. It could also be that without an engine to generate large amounts of heat, the ice just has a better opportunity to build up. In any case we arrived in Moab, with I would say in excess of 100 pounds of ice. The bed? Totally clean. Road grime concerns are bunk for cargo in the bed.
https://imgur.com/a/HlWuku1/

Also of note, Rivian’s navigation system considers dirt roads in the winter to be passable. With several feet of snow on the ground, dirt roads are not passable. This caused us a 12 mile detour, so while not serious, you need to double check its decision making sometimes.

Moab Utah really sucks for DC charging if you don’t have a Tesla. There are two Tesla superchargers in town. There is one, one singular DC fast charger for CCS. It’s broken. It’s been broken for six months. It doesn’t appear as if anybody has any intention of fixing it. Be warned if you go to Moab, Utah, in a rivian, finding a DC fast charger is very very hard.

We could’ve made it to Green River, Utah, probably without charging, we decided to play it safe and got a hotel. We stayed at the Hyatt Place, and though they said they had chargers available for EVs, it was just a Tesla supercharger in the parking lot. However, they were nice enough to either allow us to run a 110 V extension cord to the truck, or drive us to a free ChargePoint AC charger for overnight parking. I chose a latter.

Moab, UT to Salt Lake City, UT:
Temperature: 35F
Highway Speed: 74 mph
Average mi/kWh: 1.71

This is a very easy journey, most of the ice broke off of the truck, and we stopped in Price Utah again for free charging. If you stop here for free charging visit the museum.

Also, I don’t really care for Salt Lake City, Utah.

The EA station in Salt Lake just isn’t that good. While plugged in the charger, he inexplicably dropped from 220 kW to 30 kW and stayed there. I had to change chargers in order to get it back up to a reasonable rate again of about 180 kW. Lots of people charging there are constantly shifting their vehicles around, so this seems to be a consistent problem.

Salt Lake City, UT to Reno, NV:
Temperature: 10F
Highway Speed: 75 mph
Average mi/kWh: 1.72 

We made charging stops in Wendover, Elko, Winnemucca, and Fernley, Nevada. The biting cold really did have an impact on range, overall, but there are plenty of places to stop and charge. It’s worth noting that the distance between these towns is pretty big, so plan appropriately. Also, make sure you check other applications like PlugShare and verify the availability of chargers. The electrify America, chargers in Reno and in Truckee were both off-line. If I had not checked the Sparks Nevada charger, I would’ve arrive there and seen it still under construction. That really would’ve screwed me over.

Thoughts on Truck Build Quality:
I never really had any gripes on my 2017 model three when it came to build quality. Yes, it had some larger than usual panel gaps, and it had a couple of rattles here and there, but overall I really loved my three. I really liked the Spartan interior, the aesthetic really works for me. However, Rivian‘s interior is just a big step up. I find the driving position to be much more comfortable, and certain parts of me don’t go to sleep any longer during extended drives. The interior appointments of the vehicle use very high-quality materials. They’re nice to look at. They feel good to touch.

Having a heated steering wheel in cold weather conditions is amazing, and I’ve never had this luxury before. The heated seats work really well too. They saved our butts in cold weather and allowed us to turn down the cabin temperature, but still stay warm.

During the drive, I did notice that the alignment of the truck is off. Others have noticed this. If the steering wheel is dead center, then the truck is aligned slightly towards the right. I’ll make a service Center ticket for this. Also, the right rear passenger door doesn’t like to close. It needs to be slammed really hard. Other than that, everything works flawlessly. I’m very impressed with the quality of the truck, and the biggest areas of improvement are going to be in software, not in build quality. That’s a great place to be.

Seattle-Portland Roundtrip: Bad Weather Experience
Last weekend I took a round-trip from Federal Way (south Seattle) to Portland and thought I'd share my experience. Sorry for the lengthy post but I wanted to include all data possible for others to see.

**Quick summary:** The R1T is a fantastic road-trip vehicle. It's smooth, comfortable, and has good driving assistance, but the miles-per-kW was a little lower than I hoped due to temp and heavy rain. I was really disappointed in Rivian's range calculations when weather is involved. I have 4,200+ miles on the ODO and have taken it on longer trips before. Normally the range estimates are shockingly accurate down to being off by only 0-10 miles, but that is thrown out the window in non-perfect conditions. This is good to keep in mind for future roadtrips but does make me worry about the winter hit. Previously I thought I could get 1.8 mi/kW in winter, but now I think I'll be lucky to get 1.5. By no means does this make me regret buying the truck, it just means I need to plan differently. Adding an extra 5-15 minutes at a charger can save you.

**Charging summary:** I was very happy with the charging speed and network availability for a non-Tesla. It was my biggest concern when switching to Rivian but I have never run into charging issues so far. The EA app has always been accurate and every charger has pulled full speeds and has activated without issues. I still prefer EVgo if possible as they have more 350kW stations for the trips I take, but both have been great. As a standard precaution, *always check PlugShare and EA/EVgo/Chargepoint before heading to a charger* just in case Rivian's nav isn't accurate.

&#x200B;

**R1T config:**

* Wheels - 20"" AT's. Cold PSI at 48 rising to 50 on the highway
* Accessories - cargo racks installed over the bed with maxtrax on the driver's side.
* Drive mode -  conserve the whole time. Lowest suspension on the highway, and low in the city.
* Passengers/cargo - two adults with no cargo in the frunk or the bed

**Weather:**

* Temp - 50 F in the morning, 54 F in the afternoon
* Internal temp/AC settings - 71 degree in auto the entire trip. Heated wheel was on for the first 15 minutes of the trip but off for the rest. I preconditioned the cabin while it was plugged in before setting off. Heated seats were off except while charging at the EVgo station but it was turned off when driving. 
* Rain - heavy. It broke daily records in places like Olympia, WA. Wipers were on the highest two settings the whole time other than downtown Portland which auto changed to a middle speed.
* Wind - was against us going to Portland and with us coming back to Seattle. 8-17 mph N/NE.

**Charging experience:**

* Rivian recommended a 29 minute charge at an EA charger in Kelso (Longview), WA. Unfortunately Rivian's system doesn't know that this charger is terrible with a 3.8 rating on PlugShare and has had issues for months. This station only has one working charger and I wasn't going to risk it.
* I used PlugShare alongside EA and EVgo's apps to verify charging speeds and availability.
* What I did instead:
   * *Charging stop one:*
      * Electrify America (8.0 rating on PlugShare) - Vancouver, WA - 
      * Cost - $8.99
      * Started at 20% and ended at 39%
      * Time: 15 minute charge
      * Speeds: 124kW on a 150kW station
      * Availability: two cars were there when I arrived but one left within 2 minutes and the other within 5 minutes (Nissan Leaf and a Mini Cooper).
   * *Charing stop two:*
      * EVgo (10 rating on PlugShare) - Chehalis (Centralia), WA
      * Cost - $4.32. This is why I will always choose EVgo over EA if possible. Faster speeds and significantly lower cost. EA would’ve cost $16.83
      * Started at 9% and ended at 41%
      * Time: 16 minutes
      * Speeds: 204-215kW on a 350kW station
      * Availability: four open stations. No other cars were present.
      * I could have left the station with less SOC/range but didn't want to risk it since Rivian's calculations hadn't been accurate.
* Tesla still has a leg up when it comes to the ease of charging. I could always count on Tesla's supercharging status to be accurate but I can't say the same when using Rivian's nav. Not the biggest deal but it just means you have to pay more attention and check multiple apps to ensure accuracy.

**Driver+ experience:**

* Overall I was very impressed with performance. The truck held lanes and corners very well with practically no ping-ponging back and forth.
* Driver+ disengaged about 10 times due to heavy rain and cameras being blocked. This is when I *really wished* Rivian had standard cruise control. To lose cruise completely does kind of suck.
* In stop-and-go traffic, Driver+ was extremely smooth. I get car sick easily and used to feel nauseous in my previous Model Y, Subaru Outback and Jeep Grand Cherokee when using their ACC in stop-and-go. I didn't feel nauseous at all in the R1T.

Edit: one thing I forgot to add is that I wish Rivian has a better nav system while charging. The nav system didn’t know I was currently charging so if I entered a far destination, it would add unnecessary stops or fail to tell me what SOC I needed to reach at the station I was plugged into. I’m sure this will come with time."

Complete Rivian Experience With Feedback
Order Date: Nov 2021

Delivery Date: May 2022

Location: Boulder CO

Spec: R1T, large pack, black interior, 20’ wheels, Forrest Green

Delivery: Assigned guide and next day had a VIN in Denver. Previous owner must have bailed or my theory that they just made a bunch of configurations and sent them to popular service locations.

Cost: Received $45,500 for my 2019 long range Model 3, $10,000 in federal and state incentives, Taxes + registration \~$6,000, MRSP $77,000

Overall Evaluation: Absolutely love the truck. It can do it all and even though it has been far from perfect, I would do it all over again.

Background: Owned a long range AWD Model 3 for three years and loved the car but wanted something that would handle the Colorado mountains better. I, like many others, am a bit of an EV enthusiast and work in robotics so I understand a bit of the technical aspects.

Issues and Feedback:

Phantom drain:

One of the biggest issues and one I hope is fixed soon. I left the truck in an underground garage from Sunday to to Thursday with outside temperatures for the week being 40-75 deg. The truck went from 36% to 7% in that time and actually had to have someone plug it in for me because I was worried I wouldn’t be able to open the charge port when I got back Friday. Gear guard was turned off and no outlets were on. I submitted a ticket and a service appointment was made to collect more data but when the guide came to the appointment for other reasons he said it is a known issue and believes it is being worked on. Since then the car has sat in 95 deg weather outside and seen less drain so I am not sure what was happening.

Gained knowledge: Use the shipping mode if absolutely needing to reduce drain. The charge port opens from the 12V and the 12 volt only charges while plugged in or driving, not while sitting even when the battery has a charge. The 12v can last longer or shorter than the large battery and if the 12v dies, the charge port can be opened manually but it is a process. There is no limit on the battery conditioning, it will continue conditioning until the battery is at zero. I would like to see that decrease as the battery gets below 10%.

Tonneau Cover:

Obviously a known issue how bad this thing is. Mine broke about a month in likely less than 15-20 uses. The mobile repair guy for installing the spare tire gave me some information on this. He said they have had a lot of issues and will likely be pushing the manual cover retrofit once it is released. Says he has seen service vehicles with it but no customers vehicles yet. My cover was only going in about two panels. The fix, spray window cleaner on the top along the sides of the cover to add lubrications. He also said pushing the panels down from the center as they go in can help. He continued to clean it and lubricate it a bit more. A couple hours later I tried opening it and it got stuck halfway. I tried pushing the panels down and in and that got it opened all the way.

TLDR: lubricate the top with window cleaner and push center of panels down and in to open a stuck tonneau cover.

Failed Software Update:

The last software update (One with dog mode) failed to install without knowing. The next morning the screen was turned off, did a screen reset and full reset and things appeared to be working again. Noticed some strange issues with the screen but the car drove fine so I continued with driving to the mountains to do a trail run. On the way up, vehicle shipping was flashing on and off along with the car going into car wash mode. Nothing noticeably dangerous so I continued into the mountains. After the run and in about 95 deg heat, I start driving home. I tried to turn the air conditioned seats on but they turned off and the seat warmers turned on to level 2. Pushed it to level 1 and all the combinations one could think of but the seat warmer would always go back to level 2. The back window defroster also couldn’t be turned off. Drove home with the windows down and very hot. When talking with Rivian later, they noticed the failed up and pushed it again which fixed the issues. Just a bit unfortunate circumstances.

Hood Deformation:

The hood alignment at the top and bottom are good but there is about a quarter inch offset 3/4 the way up on the driver side so the only gap seen from the driver seat is pretty bad. Rivian mobile repair said nothing could be done since it isn’t alignment.

Registration Late:

Three days before the temp plates expired I called my guide with concerns. They said everything was on track and had more temp plates to be sent soon. The temp plates would have arrived but UPS had to change the delivery so I went the weekend with expired plates. Received the real plates a week later.

Charging:

It is a big battery. I won’t be doing any big road trips until the adventure network comes to fruition or the super charger network is opened up.

Pedal Mapping:

A lot of dead range and takes a bit of a press before it starts moving which confuses everyone when they first start to drive it. When flooring it, there is a noticeable lag before electricity actually starts flowing to the motors which decreases the instant torque feeling electric cars are known for. I have heard others mention it is because of the weight but it seems to be the controls software in the car which makes me hopeful they may someday release different acceleration modes. It is a bit disappointing coming from a Tesla.

Unlocking the Car and Doors:

Phone key is really bad and mostly unused. I keep it on the phone though because I want to be able to manually unlock from the app. Wish these two things were decoupled. When working nearby, I have to disable bluetooth on the phone to not drive myself crazy. Even the key fob has issues and sometimes needs to be pressed a few times for it to be recognized. I would expect that to be instant but it isn’t. Often when trying to open the tailgate, frunk or cargo tunnel there is a delay or they won’t open until I unlock it a second time. Makes it difficult to easily get in and out of different areas. Also wish the air-conditioning wouldn’t come on every time it was unlocked.

MTB Tailgate Cover:

Bought a tailgate cover and ended up returning it. The gooseneck doesn’t bide will for these as the cover needs to slide over the pad. Instead bought a hitch rack instead which is a much better solution.

Charge Error Indicators:

Occasionally when getting in the car, the battery will read zero percent and gives a good scare the first time it happens. Will also get notifications for the truck having less than 50 mi on my phone when it has over 80 mi in some cases.

Camp Speaker:

Overall very cool but when trying to use it for a party the bass continued to stop working and the volume wouldn’t go very high. I confirmed it wasn’t on no bass mode and doing a reset would temporarily fix it. It seemed to stop working when bass heavy songs came on.

Air compressor:

Bought an attachment to make it easier to use on bikes but after it would do one compression, it would fail to fill up the bike tire. Sometimes it would continue to compress but I would need to continue to push the start button. After about 20 minutes of trying to get it to work, I instead used a broken hand pump. Probably user error but at the moment I view it as something only useful for the tires on the truck.

Camera access:

It would be great to have access to second backup cam behind the cab for when tailgate is down or hitch rack is on.

Proximity sensors with hitch bike rack:

When the hitch bike rack is on, backing up is annoying. Being able to turn off the proximity sensor when something is in the hitch would be ideal.

Conclusion:

Love the truck, there isn’t a better one on the market but there is still lot of room to improve."

Weekly Rivian Roundup: Q1 Earnings are Out! [5/16/2022]
Hello hello and happy Monday!

Apologies for the later-than-usual roundup today #LifeAndWorkStuff, but I wanted to make sure we still got this out to y'all. With my truck in the shop for the [issues I talked about a while back](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/ulvpry/any_other_owners_experiencing_successfully_solve/) *(will happily report back on my service experience, don't worry)*, you're all I've got! Well, unless u/Studovich gets his truck very soon...

With that said, it's been an especially interesting week in Rivian-land, so let's dive right into it.

**Subreddit Updates**

* Once again, talking about company performance overall is allowed. This can include mentions of the stock, or even articles that have a stock-focused headline with a more substantive body ([ahem](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/uovkuf/wapo_rivian_sold_wall_street_on_an_electric_suv/)...). What we're trying to prevent is shitposting, investment advice, stock speculation, trolling, rallying, terrible memes, etc. We *want* people to talk about the company's performance overall, including its investors, production, quality, issues, etc — and even sometimes react to how the stock will impact the business, specifically by addressing longer-term trends. I know that this may seem pretty nuanced, but those are the best kind of guidelines. As a reminder...

[Rule 6.](https://preview.redd.it/c00aw0vm4yz81.png?width=600&format=png&auto=webp&s=5e3d9d5941ae3b4764e04dfdd06a69b7fc8619be)

*Note: If you have any feedback for the mods on how we can make this clearer, please comment below or use Modmail.*

* Weekly Rivian Roundup threads now have descriptive titles! How enticing.

**Rivian Roundup**

* It was Q1 Earnings last week! u/Studovich broke it down for us in the [discussion thread](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/und5on/megathread_q1_earnings_call/) (which was super civil, constructive, and awesome BTW) which I'm including below because it's great info:
   * Roughly 5,000 vehicles produced to date (not clear the split of R1 vs. EDV)
   * 10,000 new preorders since the updated pricing
   * Cash burn was approximately $1B in the quarter. They now have about $17B cash on hand
   * 2/3 of 25000 production will be r1 vehicles and 1/3 will be EDV
   * Over 90K R1 preorders.
   * As of May 9, 2022, produced 5k vehicles.
   * Since pricing update in March, received over 10K preorders
   * Cash at $17B as of March 31.
   * Net cash used in operating activities in Q1 2022 was $1.034B
   * Reaffirm 25K vehicles production in 2022
   * If supply chain constraints were resolved, estimate that they can produce 2x cars for the remainder of year. \[my thoughts: so 40-50K for 2022 if no supply chain restrictions?\]
   * Planning on launching R2 line in 2025, without additional cash raise needed
   * Looking forward to introducing new LFP battery to be used in dual motor version of R1 and EDV with single motor
   * In-house developed motor is called “Enduro”
* Who needs sand mode? [This R1T](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/uph5mf/adventuring_pics_from_recent_outer_banks_beach/) appears to already be doing just fine on the beach of the OBX. 
* [Canyon Red in front of Red Rocks](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/unjjjd/rivian_red_canyon_rocks/)? I mean... come on. That's an incredible title and I wish I could upvote it ten times.
* Those Launch Edition yellow flairs not enough for you? Well what about [yellow wheel vinyls?](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/umamxt/yellow_wheel_vinyls/)
* Rivian's version of 'The Dress', [Limestone](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/uqbgz6/for_all_the_limestone_confusion_heres_where_it/), continues to boggle the mind. Is it blue-ish? Grey-ish? The only right answer is that it depends on the light. 
* Service centers are pretty stacked with R1Ts at the moment, whether you're in [Denver](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/ups9vt/color_shopping_at_the_denver_service_center/) or [Boston](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/uq9sm0/20_r1ts_in_the_boston_service_center/)! 
* The first recall has happened! A child-safety defect resulted in the recall of about 500 trucks. You can [read all the deets here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/uo2joj/rivian_is_recalling_about_500_of_its_electric/).
* A [Rivian meetup](https://www.reddit.com/user/ajamuso/) in the Northeast! This looked super fun. As a reminder, please use our Discord to connect with our owners around you. 

[Yay Rivian meetups!](https://preview.redd.it/q5k2sptk4yz81.png?width=1356&format=png&auto=webp&s=3622df76710283d81f8ad49e8826a15cf59a8374)"

Rivian's comms do not meet expectations
This is my second post like this on this sub. While you may think that a moderator being critical of the company they run a fan community for is strange, I think it's important that we give constructive criticism to the company as needed. I love Rivian and think they're the real deal! But right now, as a preorder holder since 2018 with a still-promised ""end of November"" delivery date, I'm feeling pretty frustrated.

There are six working days left in the November. It *feels* completely impossible that Rivian will be delivering a truck to me this month. While it's *technically* possible that I could be one of the 1k R1Ts coming off the line this year as preorder holder #3,174, it feels less likely every day without any update from Rivian.

The thing is... a delay is fine. I actually expect it. I get it. I want my truck to be well-made and issue free. My issue comes from the expectation RJ set in his ""We'll do better comms to preorder holders about delivery timelines"" email. As of today, there's been no insurance email, no tighter timeline communicated, and no ""We won't hit it"" communicated either. Rivian *is* doing a better job with branding and social media, but that's not the only thing we need from them.

Back in early November, I was assured on the daily that my R1T was still on track. I sold my truck this month after being reassured things were still on track. I don't regret that and did so knowing a delay was possible. (I got a *great* price) But now I'm going to away for all of January, traveling in December, and am worried about being able to take delivery.

And listen. I know that ramp ups like this are hard. I know the company may not know exactly when something is coming. But they ran the clock down way too close on this one and broke their promise to preorder holders for better comms. We honestly deserve better because Rivian said they would *be* better. Instead, we're back in the same timeline as the last delay with everyone knowing what's gonna happen and Rivian going mum.

Here's hoping we get something soon. Does anyone know something I don't?

*PS. One thing I wanted to call out is how helpful the Guides are. This is a great program. My Guide is incredible, friendly, and truly helping me through this entire process. I don't expect her to know anything the company doesn't know — and she always tries to get me answers.*"

R1S Back From Short Denver SC Tow/Visit + 12v Battery Questions
So I posted the bad (a couple days ago) so thought I should post the good as well. R1S is back after being at the service center for 3 days. 

You can look at my post history. Basically beyond got towed because if ""Critical battery issue"". It appeared to be fully dead. 

It was towed late Sunday evening to the Denver SC. I had pretty poor /communication with the SC until Wednesday morning. I got a call and basically they said they hadn't even had a chance to look/think about it till Wednesday morning. After that communication was good and quick. Originally they said it might be 1-2 weeks. But somehow it got pushed through all in one day. Vehicle was back Wednesday evening. 

They said it was a 12v battery failure and that because the 12v controls the connectors to the HV battery it dying can come up as ""Critical battery issue"". 12v battery was replaced.

I did some research, had no idea the 12v battery was such a issue for so many people.

I'm mostly concerned about this happening in the back country where a tow won't be so easy. 

I am aware that you can jump the Rivian through the rear tow jumper cables.

Do you think you could also keep the Rivian alive in the case of a battery failure? With something like a Noco booster? 

Enough to maybe limp to civilization? 

Enough to maybe put it into neutral for the tow? (Tow truck had to drag the wheels on plastic skids)

I'm not an electrical expert but I think there is a difference between a battery failure and a dead battery right? 

Thanks!"

Tire pressure reset after new tires installed
Yesterday I got new tires on my R1S at Discount Tires after finding I had a nail in the rear passenger tire and very worn tread on all four tires. It’s been nearly 24 hrs since the new tires were installed and the tire pressure system in the car is still showing the pressure readings from the previous tires, including the one that was punctured by the nail at 35 psi. Discount Tires said I just need to drive on it for awhile. Rivian customer support asked me to do a reset (infotainment system) and it didn’t help. Has anyone dealt with this issue and gotten an answer about how to fix it that worked? Thanks! "

Apple Music Issue
Anybody getting ""Subscription Not Found"" on their Rivian? I'm on the Apple One plan. I assume something might be broken with the API (maybe something Apple changed and Rivian hasn't updated yet). I've done two soft resets and one hard one. Any suggestions about a fix would be welcomed. "

Tire Alignment
I have had my Rivian for about two months now and have had no issues thus far. However, ever since I picked it up, the tires are so pretty poorly aligned if I let go of the wheel the car will drift into the other lanes. As far as typical alignment, was my car just poorly aligned or is this normal based on weight of the car? Is this worthy of a service appointment?"

Breaker at home heated up to 165°F charging new Gen 2. Anyone else dealt with this before?
New Rivian owner and long time EV driver here. Recently picked up a Gen 2 R1S and for the first time I’ve had my breaker trip while charging an EV on my (also Gen 2 Tesla Wall Connector). 

This happened a few times and I just thought that it was an issue with the car communicating with the charger/adaptor when plugged in at 48amps. To resolve this issue I reduced the charging speed to 40amps and everything was fine. Switched over to an 80amp max rated adaptor and then tried out 48amps again, but after 20mins the circuit breaker tripped again. What was new this time was a distinct almost fishy smell in the garage. Opened the panel to fully shut off the 60amp breaker tied to my charger and it was incredibly hot, so I brought out my temp gauge and it heated up to nearly 165°. 

Long story short, called my electrician and they said the smell and tripping was from the breaker overheating and ultimately getting burned out. They replaced it right away and I’m able to get a consistent charge as of now (only been 1 day since the replacement was installed).

I’ve noticed that on the Rivian the panel is still heating up quite a bit compared to the 8+ yrs I’ve charged other cars at 48amps. Has anyone else had this happen? I’m mainly wondering if the issue has something to do with my charge port and if anyone has had theirs replaced on the car for an improper pin connection since something is likely up with my car. 

Also on that note of a possible pin connection issue, my car has consistently had the J1772 plugs at work get “stuck” where the car will say charging has stopped with the white eject light on and it won’t release the handle. Tried 4 stalls and the same thing keeps happening so I’m officially a stuck charging plug troubleshooting expert now lol. 

Already have a SC appt scheduled for next week on a bunch of other minor issues but if anyone has dealt with a similar problem I’d be interested to know how it was resolved so I can go into my appt with knowledge on what worked for others if I get the Rivian equivalent of Tesla SC’s dreaded “within spec” response. Thanks!! "

App charging issues…
So at work we have standard outlets in our parking garage for EV charging.  Nothing fancy but nice to steal some juice during a 9hr work day. Pretty much charges enough to make my round trip to work free. 

So on Tuesdays I plugged in.  App showed all the normal stats charging +3miles per hour.  Out of no where about 3hr later the app says the truck is no longer charging and delivered +100miles even tho it only added 13miles. I walk to the truck, charge port still flashing green and the dash shows still charging.  

Today I get to work and plug in. Immediately the app shows +100miles. I’ve closed and reopened the app and no refresh. 

Anyone know how to fix this? 

I haven’t charged at home because I honestly forgot about this till now. I don’t think it’s an outlet issue. Is it a portable charger issue or app issue? As you can see it says charge started at 7:48pm and I screen shot the app as soon as I plugged in.  "

Tire life expectancy
ATL Service tech told me today expected tire life is only 10-15k miles. Surely this is wrong as I've seen dozens of posts saying otherwise in this sub. When I mentioned this, she argued and said in three years with Rivian she's never seen anyone get 20k or more. What gives? Should I have been expecting to replace tires at 15k? 

Here's the background: I have a '23 R1S 20"" ATs. I rotate them every 5k-7500 miles. I don't drive like a race car driver and I don't drive in conserve mode. I've had alignment issues for the last year. I have had the vehicle aligned privately and through rivian and still having issues. Rivian does the alignment, then says it's your tires - the wear is uneven so get two new ones and problem solved. So I do that. The car has 14900 miles on it when I replace the two tires. Discount tire says the other 2 are fine. Two weeks later with new tires, on a road trip at high speeds (hwy 75mph) the alignment issues feel dangerous. Back at Rivian today is when tech tells me I should expect tire replacement of all 4 every 10-15k and that I should have replaced all 4 not just the two I was told to replace by Rivian. 

I believe whatever alignment issues I'm having are causing tire problems, not the other way around. But even if I'm wrong there and I definitely could be, my real question is, what should I expect from my tire life given I drive in standard mode, mostly suburban roads in north Atlanta and take care of the tires? And should I push back paying for the alignment and the tires? "

I am now fully scarred!
We are on a 5 week adventure pulling our Airstream. I have about 24,000 miles on our 2023 R1T. It’s worked great for several trips! I love this thing. So here is what has me VERY WORRIED:

So, we were traveling from Bozeman, MT to Jackson,WY. With a full charge from the RV park, we only needed one charge at a RAN in Gardiner, MT at the north entrance of Yellowstone. There are 4 stations (thank goodness), with 1 in use. We pulled in (after dropping our trailer around the corner and plugged in. So far so good, right?

I started talking with the other R1T owner with same year as mine. He has about 43,000 miles on his and it has also worked flawlessly.

**UNTIL TODAY!**

Out doing “adventure stuff”, his R1T developed “Turtle Mode”. After 5 hard resets in contact with Rivian’s service, they determined that: 1) they would send a tow truck to Gardiner; 2) they would need to find a place to stay since it could take 24 hours; 3) They would be provided a rental vehicle, presumably in Bozeman; 4) Their truck would go to Boise,ID; 5) They live in Seattle and would need to pay their way back to Boise.

But the REAL ISSUE is being stranded while on vacation, especially in a rural “adventure” area. So this has us both questioning whether we can rely on these vehicles while doing “adventure stuff”.  We can’t just get it to a local mechanic to “fix stuff” like most ICE cars.

**I am REALLY SCARRED now.** I love this truck, but if it is this unreliable and unpredictable, I may not be able to stomach it for “adventures” and return to an ICE truck.

I’m sickened to think of this happening to me, especially while pulling a trailer!

How many of you have had similar troubles? How many of you have 50,000+ miles trouble free?"

High Pitched Noise
Hey!  3 week 2025 Rivian R1S owner here.  We just noticed a high pitched, intermittent noise coming from the passenger side windshield area.  Unsure if it’s wind noise from the outside or an electric noise from somewhere.   Sounds like wind to me but Rivian mobile taped all the seams and it was still there.  Said to drive it to Montreal (I’m in Halifax) bc it’s the nearest service centre and has a windshield machine that can check the seal.  Montreal is 12 hrs away. (Welcome to owning a Rivian in Canada!! lol).   Any others have the same or similar issue?"

Excited and frustrated
Just picked up a new Dual Standard R1S last week and now have 400 miles on it. Coming from a Tesla M3 performance I was pretty excited for an improved experience after watching and reading so many posts and reviews about it and demoing a gen 1 last year. But the Gen2 maybe is lesser quality than I expected? My Tesla was a sore with constant QC issues. Multiple taillight replacements, the rattles, battery issues, etc… drove this for about a few days and noticed a few rattles, but otherwise much better build until, I noticed a leak. Front right passenger side, slow drip, pale blue color. Pulled the cover back and saw the coolant reservoir low but no warnings on the screen. Had to get it towed to Miami (about an hour) from me, and service there has not been responsive at all. It’s been there 3 days and all I’ve been told is “we received your vehicle”. Called service and all I’ve been told is “someone will call you with an update soon”.

This is starting to feel like my Tesla all over again. Please tell me it gets better because this is a rough start"

Positive about Rivian’s service
Hey,
Yesterday at 7:10 pm got a message in the app that my 12v battery needs to replaced. Was very disappointed and scared. Dialed the number right away and was connected to a friendly person. The technician registered my issue and asked when I would like to visit SC. Obviously: as soon as possible, like tomorrow? He said that he provided this information in the tool and I should receive a confirmation soon. At 8pm (50 minutes later, yay!) i got a notification to be at San Jose, CA Service Center at 9:15am. And.. at 11:00am the issue is part of the past. Amazing work, thank you Rivian! Zero “work hours” wait and ~12 clock hours from a problem to a happy truck :)
Just decided to share a very positive story!"

casting issues
when trying to cast on my rivian t1s quad  it wouldn’t connec. for example from max or hulu my iphone which is currently running the ios 26 beta and it would connect but it showed the casting device which is aka my rivian, my theory was its beta software so i instead used my girlfriends phone that’s running latest software from apple and it still wouldn’t work, i do not want to hassle with rivian just yet with this so im here asking if yall had the same issue what did you guys do to resolve it

side note- tried trouble shooting by turning off hotspot and tried soft & hard resetting the vehicle which didn’t not work

only thing works is youtube when casted from the iphone

Anyone here successfully using portable charger at home?
Anyone here successful in using portable charger at home? What is your set up (120V or 240V?) We don't have a 240V outlet in our garage currently.

Electrician is saying they will not install NEMA 240V (50amps or less) receptacle due to requiring GFCI breakers leading to tripping issues and prolonged charging times on these circuits can result in receptacle melting and compromising reliability and safe charging of vehicle.

Also how many miles can you get per hour on a 240V portable charger? We drive less than 30 miles a day."

100% battery discharge overnight. I’m at 0%!
I drove to a friend’s house yesterday starting with a 100% charged battery and when I arrived the battery was at about 18-20% SOC at about 9:00 pm. No systems were left on other than Gear Guard. This morning my battery was at zero percent! I plugged in the portable charger in attempt to get enough charge so I can drive about 5 miles to a higher capacity charger. It’s been three hours and although it appears to be charging (albeit it says at 1 mi/hr), the range still says 0 miles. Rivian Support is not much help. The guy says he doesn’t know if this has happened to other vehicles and says to just wait. 

I have owned this car for 2-1/2 years and never had any discharging or charging issues. The screens and all systems appear to be working. If the battery is in a low state, should I expect to wait some time until the range gets to 1? 

Has anyone else had an issue like this? Does anyone have any advice?

Thanks,

My 🍯, and why Gen 1 Quad is the best Rivian ever
Ordered 1 month before pricehike (thanks A!), got the 7500 tax credit. 

Had to grab one of the last Compass yellow R1S and accept the full off road upgrades. 

Currently at 20k miles, never had any significant reliability issues. Service appointments were prompt for me in San Jose. 

Had a windshield replaced due to rock chips, and had to patch a flat myself. Otherwise the car kept on going and had been perfectly reliable.

Got EVsportsline running boards and it was fine.

Family and children love their yellow bus. 

I am one of the majority, the majority of very satisfied Rivian customers. No, I won’t be upgrading my car, not until another Compass yellow vehicle comes out. I really think Gen 1 quad from 23-24 have the highest quality and value.

My unpopular opinion? Gen 2 is the cost cutting generation and is not built as well. Almost every Rivian problem cars I know are Gen 2. "

Damper/strut replacement 9k miles
I've had my R1S now for just over 6 months, and it's got a little over 9k miles. 

It's now in the SC for the second time regarding suspension rattle.

Turns out, this is a ""normal"" noise from the Gen2 updated strut/damper in the front.

It also turns out that this is an increasing complaint among Gen2 owners and soon to be Gen1 owners. The new design is going on all Gen1 and Gen2 cars for replacements.

So, the car suspension didn't make any noise that sounded out-of-the-ordinary until recently where it just has this constant rattle over light bumps in the road. Sounds like a broken sway bar end-link on a regular car. According to service tech, it's something to do with the fluid in the dampers.

So, the noise in mine is pretty bad. To prove that it was actually normal, they put me in a BRAND NEW R1S Dual Standard that came on their lot as a loaner, and it makes just about the same noise with 37 miles on it. OK! It must be a feature and not broken. Fine. I can live with it if it's not broken, but it's pretty damn annoying explaining to passengers that it's a quirk and not broken.

Fast forward to today, the car has been in the SC for a few days and they are going to be replacing the strut/damper in the front to see if the noise goes away with a new part. It took about 8,000 miles to show up in the first place. They will then be doing a field report on my specific vehicle about the findings with the new strut and reporting back to Rivian engineering.

So, my car is potentially part of the pathway to fixing the rattle with an updated part in the future. If the new strut removes the noise, they will dissect the old damper and figure out how to eliminate the noise - because this isn't an issue with the older dampers, and it's not an issue across the board with new ones either. It's inconsistent across new cars so there's got to be a fix out there.

Anyway, will update once the car is back with replaced damper courtesy of Rivian.

DIY Guide: Fixing Door Handle Bar Rattles

Hello everyone,

I wanted to share a quick DIY guide on how to fix some of the rattles in the Rivian door handle bars. After addressing several noise sources, I’ve managed to eliminate most of the rattles on my vehicle. Hope this helps others facing similar issues. This DIY was requested, that's why I am sharing with the community.

What You’ll Need:

Felt Tape
https://amzn.to/4kxkSLj
I picked this specific felt tape because of its ideal thickness. In some spots, I needed to remove the sticky backing and just use the felt. This one allows for easy separation of the adhesive.
Plastic Trim Tools
I used this one: https://amzn.to/4lB0gTi
But if I were buying now, I’d get this set with more tip options: https://amzn.to/3TnY5qe
Different tips help a lot when working in tight or awkward trim areas.
Scissors
Just for trimming the felt to fit small or narrow seams.

Before You Start:

If you have a Gen2 model, the door handle bar plastics are uncoated, which makes the process easier. If you have a Gen1, be more careful—using too much force with trim tools might scratch the coated plastic.

Steps:

Remove the silver plastic trim on the handle bar.
It may look like metal, but it’s actually plastic. Start by gently inserting a trim tool at the top-center area. Once the first section is loose, use a second trim tool to work along the edges and release the clips. The clips are strong and won’t break easily, but be patient.
Apply felt tape to the main rattle points.
These are generally:
Where the wood trim meets hard plastic
Where the silver trim meets hard plastic
Where soft vinyl meets hard plastic
In areas where there’s limited space (especially between soft vinyl and hard plastic), peel off the sticky side and only apply the felt. This prevents buildup that could make reassembly difficult.
Between the wood trim and hard plastic, also remove the adhesive and just use the felt for a cleaner fit.
Use minimal felt. A small amount is mostly sufficient and too much can make panels bulge or feel uneven.
Focus especially on the handle bar area. Some squeaks came from inside seams where different trim parts meet—especially where the upper and side parts of the handle bar join. In some cases, just adding felt where your hand grips the bar was enough to solve most of the issue.
Once you’re done applying felt, test the door by opening, closing, and pressing around the trim areas to simulate movement. If you still hear any noise, adjust or add felt as needed.

Advice needed for Tire Replacement
Hi Rivian Fam - In my R1T today, I ran over something that punctured my rear right tire today to the point that it cannot be repaired. I have the Pirelli Scorpion Verda that came on the R1T.  My rear tires are at 5/32 and so replacing both rears is needed. The fronts are at 6/32 and could last a little while longer if needed. 

I found a spare 21"" with brand new tire for a good deal on marketplace that would act as a spare after running the other tires down a bit more to be replaced.

  
Best course of action would be?

A) Replace all four tires now with a tire better than the Pirellis that came with the truck

B) just replace the flat with the space that is basically new, replace all four later.

C) Only replace the rears (I know this isn't really an option) 

  
I may still pick up the spare just for piece of mind down the road as my truck was lightly damaged while being unloaded from the flatbed but thats a whole different issue. Thanks!

Update. Doing all 4. "

Favorite tie-down points towards the front?
I just rented and returned a large tank of Helium for a community 4th of July parade balloons with my R1S and overall it went fine. I was a little stumped when I tried to secure the tank though. As expected I had to fold the second and third row down and it was… sporting to find something to secure the front of the tank so it wasn’t sliding around. The rails in the back are fantastic and flexible but up front the only thing I could find were various metal parts of the folded seats. That always makes me nervous as you don’t know what’s a structurally strong piece and what’s not. 

It was all smooth highway so no issues but I’m wondering what others do to secure the forward portions of their loads in the SUV?

Issues with Lane change on command
I just finished my first road trip on my brand new R1S. One thing that kept bothering me through the trip is the “lane change on command” feature kept disabling intermittently. Even if i try to enable the feature back from settings, it would immediately go back to disabled state. It works fine a couple of times after every charge break, and then again gets disabled.

8.5k miles, end of a 3k road trip. Critical battery issue tow 😢
Just got back from a 3k road trip (day after) and out of the blue it was very unresponsive. Could barely unlock it to get in. Continuous boot loops. That error would show to every once in a while during the boot loops. Called roadside assistance, they said the vehicle was inoperable and needed a tow.

Funny thing is this vehicle was proactively checked by Rivian for a 12v battery issue just before the road trip. Also we drove it around town earlier in the day, no issues. 

Curious to hear from others that experienced this."

R1T Gen2 - No audio from entertainment or chimes
Audio stopped working and have a road trip coming up before I can get in for service. Long time to be without audio. 

Anyone fix a similar issue when the standard resets don’t work?  

Chatty-G issue summary below. 

————-

Total Loss of Audio Functionality – Rivian R1T Gen 2

Vehicle:
	•	Model: Rivian R1T Gen 2
	•	Firmware Version: 2025.18.30

Issue Summary:
I am experiencing a total loss of audio output from all sources and system functions. This includes:
	•	Media (Radio, Spotify, Alexa, Bluetooth-connected phone)
	•	Navigation voice guidance
	•	Vehicle chimes (turn signals, cruise control, reverse alerts)
	•	Phone audio playback (caller cannot be heard)

There are no error codes, warning lights, or dashboard alerts.

Additional Observation:
The microphone is functioning normally—during phone calls, the other party can hear me, but I cannot hear them, indicating the issue may be specific to audio output or routing and not the input hardware.

Troubleshooting Steps Taken:
	•	Multiple soft resets using far left and right steering wheel buttons
	•	Hard reset using far-left steering wheel button + hazard button
	•	Performed an overnight reset by unplugging all USB devices, locking the vehicle, and allowing it to fully cycle overnight
	•	Verified firmware is current (2025.18.30) with no pending updates
	•	No visible wiring or hardware issues detected

Buying used from Dealership
Looking to buy a used R1s from a dealership out of state and while the car looks super clean and is a fair market price the CARFAX shows 5 previous owners. The first 2-3 owners only drove it <30-100 miles or so each so might have people trying to flip the vehicle? Planning to fly in next weekend to pick it up in person but the dealership wants a $5k non refundable deposit to take it off market. Thankfully there is a service center 10 minutes away so was going to ask rivian to have a look before driving it back 1000 miles. The car is still within the original warranty so question is … if there are any unknown issues is it still worth having the local rivian team have a look prior to purchase (if the dealership is ok with that) or would we be covered with the bumper to bumper manufacturers warranty regardless? The dealership is very reputable and has a ton of good review with two decade of service but they don’t specialize in EV/rivians so not quite the same inspection process."

How often do you find yourself soft booting/hard booting?
I'm finding myself having to soft boot my R1T probably once a week. It usually has something to do with the navigation either not working or it switches my settings. Or not switching the dash infotainment from dark mode to light, not major issues, but a little annoying. Is this common or is there something wrong with the car? Coming from a Tesla, I don't think I ever had to reboot in the 5 years I owned one, so it has me a little worried."

Let's fix the Rivian EDV (the ""Amazon electric van"")
I am an Amazon delivery driver, and I've been delivering packages for almost two years in Oregon. I have driven, worked out of, and generally spent nearly 25% of my entire existence during the last two years inside of a Rivian EDV 700. For reference, the 700 (or 500) refers to the approximate cargo volume in cubic feet, so the 700 is bigger than the 500. I want to talk about some of the few remaining flaws, in my personal opinion, that the US-spec EDVs still have.

I really like Rivian vehicles - not just the vans, which I think are quite good after almost two years of driving them, but all of them.  I have done a demo drive of an R1S, as I'm interested in getting an R2 in a few years, so I have some experience driving a consumer Rivian, and therefore I'm somewhat familiar with the similarities and differences between the consumer Rivians and the commercial Rivian van.

Everything in this post comes from a place of love and a desire to provide constructive criticism to improve these vehicles and make them better for everyone. Some of this may also apply to the R1S and R1T too, since the EDV is essentially a slightly-modified R1 chassis with a different body slapped on.



**Problem**

The vans have no brake lights for at least 1/3 of the time they're driving.

**Solution**

An OTA software update, replacing the turn signal code from the US EDVs with the German van code.

**Explanation**

This issue is about combined brake light and turn signal function, which is legal in the US. These vans were originally designed and purpose-built to be delivery vehicles, and therefore operate with the hazards on very often while they're on public roads. They also have no third brake light, unlike most vehicles. This means that 100% of US Rivian EDVs have NO brake lights at all when the hazards are activated. The [NHTSA's own study](https://www.nhtsa.gov/sites/nhtsa.gov/files/811050.pdf) found that amber turn signals likely result in a general reduction in the chance of a rear-end collision compared to red turn signals, and separate function of the turn signals and brake lights (""stop lamps"") may reduce rear-end collision probability. Most vehicles have a third brake light, so there's always some kind of brake light illuminated when slowing down, but the EDV is apparently not required to have a third brake light. However, it appears as if the German vans are required to have a third brake light, as seen in [this ](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/17riwux/rivian_edv_now_in_germany/)photo.

Rivian has built EDV 500s that are on German roads today. The smaller EDV 500 uses (by visual estimation of side-by-side vans) the same brake light as the EDV 700, but because Germany requires amber turn signals separate from the red brake lights, Rivian is already manufacturing safer taillights that can (probably) go on every EDV, not just the ones for Germany. Retrofitting all US vans is the expensive and unrealistic solution to this problem, but because the taillight function itself is all software-driven, the easy solution is to do an OTA update to all vans, putting the code for the German taillights into the US vans. This would make the bottom portion of the brake light be only for turn signal function, and the top portion only for stopping indication. It would also hopefully enable third brake light functionality too. It's an imperfect fix, but would be a massive improvement over what we currently have, and would be nearly free to implement. You can see the German van turn signal in [this ](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MFDt5JAuz4U&ab_channel=Amazon.de)video at 39 seconds in, if you're really curious.

  
**Problem**

The turn signals turn off when they shouldn't.

**Solution**

An OTA software update.

**Explanation**

Imagine an ordinary car, where when you turn on a turn signal, and then turn the steering wheel, you hear clicks that correspond to when the turn signal will automatically turn off when you turn the steering wheel back to center. In my experience, it seems to me like the EDV has two such positions, ≈90° (""position 1"") and ≈315° (""position 2""). 

First, turn the steering wheel right, and pass position 2, then activate the left turn signal. Now, turn the steering wheel to the left. As soon as the wheel passes center and hits left position 1, the turn signal will shut off. It seems to me to be a simple software issue that I would imagine is pretty simple to fix (I'm fairly sure I could write the code to correct this). 

Anyone with an R1S or R1T that wants to test this in their vehicle, please do so and let me know if this issue also exists in those vehicles.

  
**Problem**

There is only adaptive cruise control, not ordinary cruise control. ACC often doesn't work when driving into the sun.

**Solution**

An OTA software update.

**Explanation**

The code to fix this is already present in the van! Just allow us to access it as ordinary cruise control. The adaptive cruise control IS ordinary cruise control when there isn't a vehicle in front of the van. I don't understand why cameras are necessary for using cruise control. It's frustrating to have a 25 minute highway drive and continuously get a ""Glare on camera"" error when trying to use cruise control.

Since I am highly confident these vans will never get anything from the Autonomy Platform, it makes sense to me to replace the highway cruise assist double-tap in the EDVs, that's currently not doing anything at all, to instead just activate ordinary cruise control. One tap down for ACC, two taps down for non-adaptive CC.

  
**Problem**

The lane-keeping assist likes to try to drive the van off the road sometimes.

**Solution**

An OTA software update.

**Explanation**

This issue relates to the adaptive cruise control problem. If ACC is activated, and then the van ends up driving towards the sun, the glare can cause the system to ""see"" lanes that don't exist. Much more commonly, the lane-keep assist finds phantom lane lines when the road is wet, which is really terrifying when you're doing 55 mph while it's raining and the van suddenly steers hard to the right or left. I've nearly wrecked a few times because of this specific situation.

Just let us turn off the lane-keep assist, and bonus points to also disable it automatically when the windshield wipers are on or rain sensor detects moisture, for example.

  
**Problem**

The throttle curve on the accelerator that prevents >≈5% at or near full steering lock is both a massive safety hazard, and has also resulted in me nearly getting the van stuck multiple times on hills.

**Solution**

An OTA software fix to adjust the curve and allow us to access more throttle at the extremes of the steering angle range.

**Explanation**

When I first started driving these vans, we could access full power more or less whenever. This resulted in numerous people giving the vans a lot of throttle at or near full steering lock, which we were told was a direct cause of CV axles pre-maturely failing. We were told that to mitigate this and extend the CV axle life, the vans received an OTA update that altered the throttle curve to prevent almost all acceleration above ≈97.5% steering angle either direction. 

In theory, this was a great fix, but in practice, this has resulted in situations where multiple drivers that I work with, and I, have been turning out of driveways onto busy roads, and needed to be at full steering to make the turn without crossing into oncoming traffic. This, however, also prevented almost all acceleration, which most of us were not used to and not expecting for the first few months. I'm aware of multiple near-collisions where vehicles had to brake hard to avoid colliding with us. 

Please re-assess the throttle curves and consider internal testing to find a good trade-off between the longevity of the CV axle components and allowing as much throttle to be accessed as possible. This is a very serious safety issue that I sincerely hope is remedied before a major collision occurs as a direct result of this intentional functionality.

  
**Conclusion**

These are the major pressing issues that I have found with the EDVs as they stand. I am not sure how many of these issues may also exist in currently road-going R1Ts and R1Ss, but for the EDVs, because there are so many of them already on the roads, I personally believe that identifying these potential safety issues and working on a meaningful solution should be a top priority for Rivian and Amazon. 

To pre-emptively address possible arguments for aesthetics, these vans were explicitly designed with Amazon for package delivery. They are meant to do a job, not look nice. Anyone who prefers the look of all-red taillights has a valid opinion, but should reconsider that argument in regards to any vehicle built solely for commercial use, as the EDV is.

I didn't mention all the great things about the EDVs. For example, the comfort, the headroom for 6ft+ people such as me, and how surprisingly pleasant they are to drive, not just for a large van, but for any vehicle in general, all really impressed me at first, and still impresses me today. They're great vehicles in my opinion, and I'd love to see the kinks addressed and resolved to make these vans even better. I feel confident in saying that some of these fixes would also end up benefiting current R1T and R1S, and future R2 and R3 owners.

Also, Rivian, if you see this, I would love to drive one of these EDV 700s around a track sometime...."

Door handle squeak fix.. finally!
Like every other gen2 owner, the door squeak is unnerving. It's especially embarrassing when your trying to show others around in the car and the finger nails on a chalkboard noise is the first thing you have to explain. I've done the ""just shoot it with some lubricant"" fix every which way possible and it never seemed to improve it.. until today. 

Finishing up some honey-do-list plumbing fixes and was using my inspection 'snake' camera.. I realized I could probably use it to finally get to the source of this horrible door handle sound. It took about 60 seconds to locate the actual issue, and it turns out its not the handle itself. It's also not anything with the spring or hinge mechanism. It actually turns out to be something that literally could only be seen with an inspection scope. Its unfortunate I can't record video with it, so I'll post pics illustrating where the problem area is, and where 'exactly' you need to point some dry lubricant. The first pic is for reference.. you have to open the door handle all the way and basically look toward the back side of the handle opening. At first glance it looks to be just this black hole of nothing, but closer inspection reveals where the door handle slides against another tiny plastic piece. The more you open the handle, the harder it pushes this plastic piece as it slides over it (creating the squeak), which eventually presses an unseen 'button' which triggers the door opening. I would love to talk to the engineer who came up with this design (and why gen1 doesn't seem to be affected). Hopefully the pics explain it better than words can, but my door handles are all now completely silent. I'm confident the dry lubricant will need to be reapplied, so the next thing will be experimenting with plastic safe lubricants that will last much longer.

Driver + Cruise Cancelling More Often?
Hello Everyone,

Has anyone else been encountering their cruise control  disengaging much more frequently as of late? It seems to be doing it at times that don't make sense. I'm wondering if a full reboot might help or if it might be a current bug to go with the randomly unlocking itself at home issue.

Long time lurker, first time buyer
Recently picked up this beauty and LOVE IT! Went with LA Silver since I never see any around my area and the color looks amazing clean (and when slightly dirty). 

Right away I put it to work on a family roadtrip with 3 rear facing car seats + 4 adults and this car had everyone sitting comfortably while also swallowing up our luggage and diaper bags with ease. Coming from a Model 3, the storage and seating capacity were a game changer (for obvious reasons with my former car being a sedan), but it made this type of trip possible with my family in-town a breeze. We used to take two cars for this kind of thing which made it rare, but we’ll most likely be doing this more now that everyone can fit into one car. 

Overall I’m super happy with the decision to go with Rivian and being part of the community here. Really reminds me of what it was like in the Tesla crowd back in 2017 where I’d get tons of questions from people about the brand since R1S/T still aren’t mainstream vehicles most people see on a daily basis. 

Only issue so far is that my existing Tesla Wall Connector tends to shut itself off when I charge the Rivian at 48amps with a Lectron adaptor, but it appears that the adaptor isn’t built to handle the full power delivery so I’m currently only charging at 40amps to give some buffer and prevent overheating. Hopefully I’ll have better luck with an A2Z NACS-to-J1772 that I ordered. "

Sutton Motorsports: this has to be a scam, right?
I have an AutoTrader alert set up for any R1Ss below a certain amount (we're hoping to buy a used one in the next year-ish) and I got alerted that there was a 2023 with 18k miles listed for $48k by a private seller. I couldn't believe it, but I was curious. (The lowest non-totaled I've seen has been in the mid-$60k range.)

I messaged the seller and they said they're actually a dealer called Sutton Motorsports and they offer free delivery nationwide with a 30-day return policy. I asked some more follow up questions about the battery and any known issues (0% degradation and none, respectively) and then they said they could provide a Carfax and full quote, but that I needed to search for them on Google and send a contact request through their website because AutoTrader doesn't allow links in chat.

So I Googled and the first thing I saw was that Google Maps says that they are permanently closed. The most recent review was over a year ago. What appears to be their website is actually suttonmotosports dot com (no R, not linked to avoid driving traffic there just in case). When I go to their Yelp page, the link to their website does contain the R, and the website says the domain expired. If I go to ""their website,"" I see they have 5 R1Ss for sale, all below $53k.

At this point, all I can hear in my head is ""if it seems too good to be true, it probably is."" So, this has to be a scam, right? Has anyone heard of this company and can you confirm one way or the other?

(""Their website"" says they are at 12633 Research Blvd, Austin, TX 78759, if anyone is in the area and wants to go see if they exist.)"

1 week in. Airbag issue.
1 week into the R1S. I love this car and still learning a lot from it! Has anyone else have the Airbag system notification pop up on their Rivian?  I called the SC & I have a service ticket & being seen on Monday. We did a soft and hard reset & the notifications still popped up.  Anyone else have gone thru this and what was the outcome of it? 

Thanks in advance! "

Did one of the recent updates bork charging or is it me?
It just took me five tries to get charging at an EA 350kW unit and I kept disconnecting from a CP unit earlier today. I used to charge without issue using my Tesla wall connector but now my R1T disconnects often.  The Rivian and newest Tesla chargers work like a charm. Why is it so hard for the other companies to make this work and why am I having so many disconnects at home?  Love the truck, frustrated with the charging. Thanks for listening to my Ted Rant. "

R1s Tri Max Gen 2 : First Impressions & Few comparisons with Model Y Juniper RWD
1. Even in sport mode, r1s’s acceleration feels muted compared to M Y RWD. MY’s accelerator is very sensitive and gives you immediate access to all the power making it very zippy once you get to 20mph. In the case of R1s, the delivery of power is more gradual and the pedal distance is long. At 65 speed, it feels like there is a lot of power to be still had. But what’s the point if we cannot use it? The rivian technician mentioned that this delivery of power was  intentional and serves the off-roading purpose which the car was designed for. So a very powerful car which doesn’t feel as powerful on regular roads?

2. Premium Audio: Contrary to some of the posts here, I felt the audio was amazing. The speakers in M Y are nice but R1s is much better. Very happy. The delivery person tweaked the settings before handing it over and may be that made the difference 

3. UI design is nice but feels laggy compared to M Y. Hope it’s a software issue

4. Suspension is not bad in soft mode but it’s better in M Y. The lead technician said “I don’t expect it to be better than what it is today”. Same with body roll. Not bad but can be better 

5. Every time I come to a stop at the traffic light and then engage the accelerator, I can feel a slight vibration and/or some sort of a faint sound as though something is being released or latched. The technician drove and mentioned it to be fine. Anyone else had a similar experience?

6. It’s not a tight and clam ride if the road is bumpy. Most of the rattling seems to be coming from the cup holder in the middle which is cheap plastic. Once that is closed, it feels better but still I can hear noises from behind the rearview mirror, driver’s side seatbelt area and somewhere from the back. 

7. They forgot to fill up the windshield washer fluid and got a warning. The SC immediately topped it off. 

Only (1) and (5) were really bothering me. Wife was least concerned about (1) as she felt the acceleration was smooth. In all other aspects (space, toughness, seating etc) it’s a perfect 7 seater SUV. Not to mention …the looks are simply one of the best"

Driver Side Rear Passenger Seatbelt Sensor Spontaneously Alerting - Uhaul in tow
Hello.  Not sure if you have experienced this.  I just sent to Rivian as a request for service.

""Hi, drop up to (XXX - 300 mile drive)  with a Uhaul in tow (5x8) connected to the Rivian using the 7 to 4 pin adapter.  During the drive up, the rear driver side passenger seatbelt sensor would keep going off spontaneously, even though my rear seat passenger was not moving or touching the seatbelt release button.  After we dropped off the Uhaul, we did not experience this same issue.  Never had issues like this before.  Can you please look into it?""

Tempe AZ SC - Fantastic Service!
Got a text on June 16th asking me to schedule an appointment for 12v battery and bracket replacement.  I had no 12v issues - just Rivian being proactive.  It’s a 2025 R1S DMP.

Called in and also requested a regular service/inspection with tire rotation and a few other minor fixes:

	- right front fender trim was loose due to broken clip.  My double sided tape fix was starting to fail.
	- whistle at speed from top of driver side window.
	- blind spot warning didn’t work 90% of the time.

I was on vacation returning June 28th so they scheduled me for 8am on June 30th. Can’t beat that.

Drop off was quick and painless with an uber to enterprise.  Estimate was 5 days.  Got the notification yesterday (July 2nd) that it was done.  Pick up and verification of repairs took 10 minutes.  All work was excellent.

By far the best auto service experience i’ve ever had.  "

Advice: 5th service being scheduled in 4 months
I leased a Dual Standard and took delivery early March. Service visit 1: Wireless charger, door rattles, alignment. Service visit 2: wind noise, speaker rattle (new after previous visit) and alignment. Mobile Service 3: ambient lighting went out on passenger side. Service visit 4: alignment. —— my R1S performs a little better on the highway but on city streets and while slowing or decelerating the car aggressively pulls right and requires counter steering 90% of the time I’m driving. I didn’t report the alignment issue in my second visit as I figured I could just deal with it as I want to love this car so much. Now, I’m just getting annoyed while driving. Do I just keep going through service or am I in grounds to ask for a buy back? Any advice here would be great. Thanks y’all. "

If You’re Thinking of Getting a R1, I would be very cautious
This isn’t meant to be a hate post, I really wanted to love this car. Bought an R1S last year and it’s been nothing but trouble. We’re on our 7th issue now with service wait times exceeding 8 weeks. Also, somehow the software has gotten worse. Yes we finally did get Video Casting and Apple Music but it came at the expense of a stable software. I have to soft reboot at least once a week because of issues with the navigation system. 

I know there’s a ton of Rivian fans out there who will claim they have had zero issues and the love their rig, which is awesome; Just be aware that if you have any issues (which is very likely, just look at the consumer reports chart of service claims in the first year) you’re in for a long and frustrating wait. Also, the customer service has really been lackluster lately. My first issue or two I had they really went through extra mile. The last issue I had which was charging cable related (The cable stopped working so I could no longer charge) they weren’t sympathetic at all and after 2 weeks they ended up shipping it to the wrong address and were like “sorry not our problem…” 

Sorry for the rant, it’s just I see so many curious people asking about Rivian, and I really wanted to love it, but it’s been arguably the worst vehicle I’ve owned in a long time "

Charging schedule weirdness
Second time posting about this issue. Can’t find my first post for some reason. 

Gen2 R1S.

I had my car set to charge between 3am and 9am. It’s a slot my utility prefers. 

So it was in the high 50% area yesterday and I plugged it in at like 11am tee cleaning the garage. The little light by the charger ejection button was blue. The EVSE (ChargePoint Home Flex) was blue. Fine. Went to bed. 

Lo and Behold I woke this morning and checked the app and the thing hadn’t charged. It seemed to START when I cracked the app open— I saw its kw/hr transfer  rate go from 0.0kw to like 10.8kw. 

Is it waiting to charge until the very last moment? Why wouldn’t it start at 3am and end early?

Why is this happening? 
The car’s location is definitely “at home.”
Is there a software m thing I need to flip?

I’m extra annoyed because we have visitors and we’re going for a bit of a road trip today— so I had planned on pushing the charge up a bit past my normal 70%. 

Saw something on my local “buy nothing group” I wanted to pick up a few blocks away but now my car is trapped in the garage fuelling up rather than being ready to go. 

Any ideas? "

Gen-2 R1S: front and back sensor / ACC faults won’t disappear—25 straight days in the shop and a 4th repair scheduled. Anyone have help getting a recurring issue fixed or vehicle bought back?
Hi all—looking for advice (and maybe success stories) before this turns into a Lemon-Law saga.

Why I’m here:

My 2025 Gen-2 R1S Dual-Motor Max Performance has flashed the same front-sensor alert—instantly disabling Adaptive Cruise Control and Driver+—since the day I took delivery in late March. Rivian’s tried three times; the fault keeps coming back.

Timeline so far:
	•	6 Jun → 1 Jul (25 consecutive days): Truck lived at the Miami Service Center.
	•	Failed multiple in-shop test drives; radar and sonar were replaced, more parts ordered.
	•	End of June: techs said it finally passed their test drive.
	•	1 Jul: I drove it home, merged onto the highway, and—bam—same alert within an hour. Logged a new ticket with photos.
	•	16 Jul: Another repair already booked, but my advisor says a loaner “can’t be promised.”

Why it matters:
	•	I’m about to cross 30+ cumulative downtime days in the first 90 days of ownership and heading into repair attempt #4—basically a step away from Florida Lemon-Law territory.
	•	Other Gen-2 owners seem mostly trouble-free, so this feels VIN-specific.

Looking for insight:
	•	Has anyone with a Gen-2 R1S/R1T wrangled a sensor or radar issue that just wouldn’t die?
	•	Did anyone successfully push Rivian for a buy-back or like-for-like swap when the fixes kept failing?
	•	Any tips on securing a guaranteed loaner and getting the right people at Rivian to own the problem before things get legal?

My gen 1 loaner from last month was great, I had 0 issues. 

Appreciate any stories—what finally worked, what didn’t, and who inside Rivian actually made it happen. 🙏"

R1T unlocks when at home
I seem to have an issue where the vehicle will unlock at random if I am around it while it's parked in my garage. 

Not sure how I can explain this, but if I am out in my garage my R1S will randomly unlock, then lock and unlock again while I am next to it. I have the ""Locking Behavior at Home"" setting set to ""Lock Only"", but it would seem that is not the case. Sometimes it will unlock until I manually lock it (only for it to be unlocked again after a random time frame), or it will unlock for a random time only to lock and eventually unlock again. 

Has anyone heard or seen this happening?

Charging issue

I’ve been doing a bit of travel this month and have had to stop at various chargers. During my last session, I stopped at a Tesla Supercharger. I initiated the charge through the Tesla app, got out of my vehicle, and plugged in my R1S.

Somehow, Rivian’s Plug & Charge system took over the session. The Tesla rate was $0.35/kWh, but I ended up being billed by Rivian at $0.52/kWh.

Did I do something wrong, or is this a software bug?

Also worth noting—Rivian closed my support ticket without any explanation or back-and-forth. As someone who loves the brand, that was a bit disappointing.

Another used  dealer fiasco.
After months of shopping for a used R1T, I finally pulled the trigger on one. One issue, it is in Florida and I’m in WI. So…”roadtrip”. I’m good with that. 2am, took bus to Chicago for a cheap flight to FL. Get to the  Hyundai dealership only to find the R1T completely dead. Tried jumping 12v system and 110 charger   Can get the screens on with 12v on charger but not enough charge to main batteries to get it in neutral. It’s 100 ft to super charger - so we wait for a flatbed to tow it 100 ft with skates and flatbed.  (5 hours so far) Rivian says it may need new 12v batts. Dealership can do that but it might need Rivian after that to reset and service center is 100 miles away.  So I’m stuck at a dealership without my car (haven’t signed final paperwork yet) still love it, but I might be stuck here for days. "

Rivian charged me for service for which I did not receive an estimate, how has anyone else responded?
I requested mobile service for an issue with my R1S. I was told it was covered under warranty by the national line operator, and later by someone at the local service center. 

The mobile tech arrived a few days later and made the repair. I never received any estimates, documentation, etc.  I never received a request in the mobile app to approve an estimate or approve a repair. 

Later that day, I was charged by Rivian for the service. They used the credit card that had been saved in my online account to pay for Connect+.  Again, I never approved a work estimate, I never received a work estimate, and I never approved a charge to my card. 

My state law requires motor vehicle repair facilities to provide an estimate for repair work, which I did not receive. 

I have contacted Rivian support twice in the past two days and was told my issue was being escalated, but no one ever contacted me. 

I have filed a complaint with my states Comm. of Motor Vehicles, and will probably follow that up with a complaint to Dept. of Commerce and Insurance.

Upgrade or keep Gen1 Launch Edition R1S
I have some positive equity in the launch edition R1S I purchased in 2022 and am tempted by the current lease offer to cover the $6500 down payment. My vin is 0020xx so definitely an earlier R1S. I love the car and haven’t had a single major issue but have read here from previous owners that once you get north of 30K miles things start happening. I know the warranty coverage is strong on the Launch editions but the appeal of the gen 2 for a similar monthly payment is appealing to me. After the sale I can pocket ~$15k and maintain the same monthly payment on a lease for a gen 2 Tri.

My biggest issue with my gen 1 is the suspension. I’ve heard the gen 2 is a pretty dramatic improvement and this would be my biggest reason, in addition to the equity I can get for the sale. I can only imagine that as I put more miles on this (currently at ~$26k) and newer editions come the depreciation is going to get worse. I’d hate to lose the meridian sound system and some of the other standard launch edition features but I think the pros outweigh the negatives. 

I also like the thought of future proofing large software updates and enhancements to driver +

Has anyone had a similar decision to make recently and are you happy with your decision? Talk me into or out of this!

Snow and Steep Gravel Driveway
I bought a vacation house in the NC mountains last November which has a very steep gravel driveway with switchbacks. Last winter when we had about 8 inches of snow I had some issues getting up it (tires spinning) and had to leave my truck at the bottom of the hill, and importantly far from my charger. So my question is it realistic for me to think that with better preparation this year, I can avoid that problem next winter and get up the driveway? I've bought snow socks and could get a plow attachment for my tractor to clear some of the snow. 

I have limited experience driving in the snow and just not sure what I should expect my truck to be able to handle. I have a Gen1 quad motor R1T.  Also, there is a pretty severe drop off one side of the driveway so that has me a bit nervous about it too. "

Latest Out of Spec video not the greatest look for Rivian
For those who don't watch, the guys got a loaded R1S for one of their friends.  Rivian knows who OOS are and all about their videos.   DESPITE knowing this, the car had major issues.  The car was delivered with several dozen miles on the odometer, and whatever QC they did, they didn't detect these issues.   The biggest issue was unsafe driving characteristics at high speed.

Moreover, they couldn't get a timely service appointment initially.   Then Rivian relented and put the vehicle in for service, but in the video Ill link below, it seems like a favor was done for the OOS crew, which implies a normal not-famous customer was bumped out.

Finally, even though the majority of issues were addressed, the vehicle is still not aligned properly.  

  
This is a FAIL on every level.  Initial poor QC for a known customer, preferential treatment in the service queue, and failing to fix the vehicle alignment properly.  

That is absolutely crazy.  What is going on there....

Cabana Top + 1st actual Rivian competition?

Fellow Granola Munchers,

I'm calling on everyone to gather around to discuss a topic that, while I know is not important to all, is definitely important to many:  the ""Open Air Experience"" of driving; as well as the possible incoming competition from Scout Motors.

Disclaimer: I'm an R1S quad owner since Feb 2024 and have been a massive Rivian advocate and enthusiast for many years. Absolutely love my R1S and have had zero complaints or issues whatsoevor and was planning to add the R1T to my garage this year as well.

TLDR; I am entering confused Rivian enthusiast territory after discovering the new Scout Motors blueprints for their 2027 EV lineup.

———

I along with many of my trusted associates are big fans of the ""open air experience"" in cars. Especially in our daily driver (not looking at you Jeep).

Translation: The more windows and openings, the better. (Grow up)

Therefore my only ""gripe"", if you can even call it one, with Rivian is that neither A) the rear window, nor B) the roof of the car can open up. If there was even a sunroof in the R1 lineup l'd probably be the happiest SOB you ever met.

Enter Scout Motors.

I've recently been introduced to Scout Motors' resurrection story. They promise a badass EV truck and SUV by 2027. And not only are they EV, but they also have a gas generator add-on option that can recharge the battery itself (unlike a hybrid vehicle) which they claim can offer up to 500+ miles of total range.

That's pretty cool.  I guess.  Not necessarily cooler than our beloved Rivian though.

But what's REALLY piqued my interest though is their Cabana Top and Retractable Rear Window, which would make it the 3rd pickup truck in America to offer a ""convertible"" experience, joining the ranks of the Jeep Gladiator and Hummer EV (neither of which appeal to me).

Now THAT'S cool. At least to me.

I was planning on adding the R1T to my garage this year as my new daily driver while handing off the R1S to my wife, but now the Scout Terra pickup is totally on my radar.

Has Rivian disclosed any plans to add sunroof, retractable rear windows, or anything at all to add to the R1 ""open air experience""?

And cabana tops and retractable rear windows aside — Are we at all concerned that Rivian could be facing some stiff competition from Scout in the coming years?

Looking to just get a conversation started, as I am suddenly nearing confused Rivian enthusiast territory."

256 event limit for Gear Guard?
I parked at an indoor parking garage for a  conference yesterday and was able to plug in to free hotel charging.  The charging units blink when there’s active charging and after a few hours, I came back and noticed 256 new events for Gear Guard!  After reviewing a few dozen, it looks like it was the blinking charger that activated each event recording.

Interestingly, while I have a 2 TB drive connected for Gear Guard, all of the footage older than the 256 events were not viewable on the touchscreen.  I don’t think it’s a storage issue since each clip is ~30 seconds couldn’t possibly add up to 2 TB.  I wonder if it’s a coding issue/fluke with a max limit of 256 events?

Lesson Learned: Insist on a thorough check when reporting issues
Last year I brought my 2022 R1T (currently at 61,000 miles, was around 44,000 at the time) in for service to address a few issues, one of which was a constant quiet scraping sound coming from the rear wheels. I assumed it was brake or wheel bearing related, but the service center told me they “couldn’t replicate the issue.” The sound continued but I figured they knew what they were talking about, what I was hearing was normal and they had been listening for something else.

Fast forward to last month: I started hearing a pretty loud squealing noise from one of the rear wheels. I took it to a local shop, and they found the inside rear brake pads were completely gone, while the outside pads were still around 60%. They recommended replacing both the pads and rotors in the rear.

None of the local brake shops wanted to work on it, they said they didn’t have experience with Rivians, so I took it to a nearby authorized collision center I had worked with before. They quoted the same price as Rivian, they’re able to source parts from and communicate with Rivian, and since my nearest service center is a 4–5 hour drive (each way), it seemed like a good option, especially since I’d been to the service center very recently (58,000 miles) for a final in warranty appointment and didn't want to do the drive again so soon.

While replacing the brakes the collision center found that the rear calipers were seized. They contacted Rivian, and after several back-and-forth conversations (some of which I was looped in on), Rivian ultimately decided that the caliper issue wasn’t covered under warranty.

Here’s the part that’s frustrating:
Yes, I’m technically out of warranty now, but I wasn’t when I first reported the brake issue. I believe the caliper problem existed at that first appointment. And even if it didn’t, the truck was back in for a full service and multi-point inspection at 58,000 miles, and they still missed the worn pads, rotors, and seized calipers. I find it hard to believe the calipers seized and I then burned through half of my pads in just 3,000 miles.

I’m not thrilled about replacing the pads and rotors, my last vehicle (a Tesla Model 3) went well past this mileage without needing it, but I get that brakes are a wear item. What’s harder to accept is needing new calipers due to what seems like a clear mechanical failure, one that probably would’ve been covered if it had been taken seriously earlier on.

Just wanted to share this as a heads-up:
If you hear something weird or feel like something’s off, don’t let them brush you off with “can’t replicate it.” Be persistent. Push for a real inspection. It could save you a lot of money and hassle down the line.


-To add insult to injury the ""replace 12v battery"" alert came on a week later. Luckily the collision center quoted me the same price as the service center for that as well so that's being worked on too."

Way underrated feature?
We just wrapped an in-state road trip (<1000mi) with a 5yr and 2yr old. First things first, despite a weird charging issue I need to have checked out (requires a reset before each RAN charge), the R1S is an incredible road trip rig! Tons of space, super comfortable, versatile… just the best all around.

But the feature we kept talking about the most? The tailgate. Perfect for so many things … diaper changes, shoe changes, picnics, holding everything in while you lift the rear hatch to grab something, etc. 

That’s all. :-) 
Happy adventuring!

New owner, the key?  Help.
I've had the R1T for about two weeks now. At first, the doors would automatically open and close every time I entered my garage, which was a bit annoying. But now, it’s requiring me to take out my iPhone, connect via Bluetooth before it will unlock it—but is connecting automatically to the camp speaker. It seems like the issue started when the speaker was delivered.

Is this normal behavior for a Rivian? Honestly, traditional door handles and the start/stop system in my old Audi felt much more intuitive. No drama and just worked. "

Check out my 360 camera. It’s the white R1S gen 2 and check out the photos of other gen 2 cameras. Mine distorts significantly in the back while the other cars have minor distortion but maintain the straight lines. I had a gen 1 before and currently have a gen 1 loaner all without this issue.

Pointless Dent Repair in SoCal
I unfortunately backed into one of those wooden storage cabinets in an apartment parking spot and dented in the top of the tailgate. There a couple of light scruff and scratches I can machine buff out myself, but I’m interested in finding a well-regarded PDF dent specialist near the Ventura/LA county area. In the past I’ve had issues with PDF guys not wanting to work on aluminum vehicles, however I’ve seen videos of this repair being done in other states. So hoping someone in this community has any recommendations.

Going through the car wash causes my cameras to be temporarily disabled. Anyone else deal with this?
I already have a ticket placed but they won't see me till the middle of August. Anyways, like the title says, after I go through the carwash all my cameras get disabled. Then after some time, they come back on (maybe after it dries in the summer heat?) and work fine until I go through the carwash again. I also tried putting in carwash mode to see if it was a software issue, but that doesn't seem to cause.

 Obviously from the symptoms I'm pretty concerned that there is water getting in somewhere and causing a short. But it's weird the cameras come back and work fine. 

Has anyone else ever dealt with this? If so, what was the diagnosis? "

Door squeak before and after
Each door takes about half an hour to fix properly. Using felt with adhesive backing and plastic trim tools gets the job done. On the plus side, some road rattles have also been resolved. The culprit turned out to be the door trim itself.

It’s disappointing that a $100K vehicle has issues like this, and even more so that such problems are normalized by some. At this price point, build quality should be held to a much higher standard."

Recommendations for radar detectors?
Hi all, 

I thought I'd ask here to see what recommendations you might have. 

In my last car, I had a dashcam that also would give me alerts for any upcoming speed cameras. When I got my R1T, I had no need for the same dashcam, which I now have as a backup that I was going to install in my mom's car. 

The problem I'm facing is that here in Chicago, a bunch of new cameras just got installed, and I've noticed a few that have been installed but no notice was sent out about these cameras. Thankfully, I'm not one to speed, especially not in the R1T, but I do tend to hover up to 5mph over the speed limits. 

The other issue is that I've found some cameras are bit too sensitive to any speed. I drove past a new camera while driving at the posted 20mph speed limit, which still set the camera off. Thankfully, nothing came of this (as of yet), but it would be nice to just have something to avoid potentially setting off cameras. 

It would be cool if Rivian did what my Thinkware dashcam did and would have a database of all speed cameras that updated on a regular basis. But I know something like this would be very low in their list of priorities. 

Anyway, thoughts/recommendations? "

Just Picked Up: Initial Impressions and Questions
Just picked up this blue beast and it was definitely an interesting experience with the pickup process. My initial thoughts and questions coming from a Model 3:

- Panel alignment is a little better than Tesla, but my hood is still misaligned and needs a service ticket.

- So many swirl marks everywhere on the clear coat. Do they wash these cars with sandpaper prior to delivery? A couple of spots where paint came off as well. They’ll need correction with a service ticket. Debating getting ceramic coating done just to get paint polished to remove the swirl marks. Really not great at this price point. 

- The door handles and central locking is REALLY loud. There’s literally a thud when the car gets put into gear. Of course the door handles squeak too. Another service ticket. 

- Car feels like it wanders a bit at speed. Is this normal or does the car need another alignment?

- AC compressor or fans vibrate the steering wheel at higher power. Haven’t felt vibrations through a steering wheel like this since driving ICE cars 20 years ago. neither of my Teslas have this issue. Is this something people have had luck getting fixed? Probably the most disappointing part of the experience driving the car. 

- Software isn’t too far behind Teslas for the most part. They just need to work on app support, navigation, and maybe rethink some of the UI as far as placement of info on the screen and sub menus. Took Tesla years to get where they are from a software perspective so I have confidence that Rivian can do it. Just copy the features Tesla has now to catch up and then think about innovating. 

- Interior is much higher end feeling than Model3/Y but doors require a fair bit of force to close and don’t really have a solid sound like a thunk; more like a rattle. Kind of disappointing at this price point. 

- Range estimates seem to be more accurate so far compared to Teslas calculations which is a welcome change. 

- Second and third row functions are hard for my 9 and 7 year olds so I have to help them with putting seats up and down and sliding them. Would have been nice if a little more thought was put into these mechanism to make it easier for smaller sized people. Power seats would solve this problem. 

Overall the R1S is a very nice vehicle but maybe less impressive if you’re already used to driving an EV. Hopefully service will address the little niggles and software updates will add some more impactful features. I noticed at pickup that the majority of trade ins were Tesla Model 3 or Y (myself included). The real litmus test will be road trips and DC fast charging. I’m hoping it’ll be just as easy and as fast as it was with Teslas.

Delivery Cancelled
So I have an R1S delivery scheduled for tomorrow.  Took advantage of the June incentives which require delivery to be taken by June 30th.  I scrambled over the last few weeks to buy out my Tesla Model y from US bank.  The title arrived on Friday, I took it to the only DMV in Minnesota open on Saturdays yesterday morning and transferred the title to my name.  The woman working there seemed to think there would be no issue trading it in immediately.  I have that receipt from DMV and a paid in full letter from US Bank, but just received this text message at 9am today: 

Hi *****, the trade-in team let us know that your title has an open reassignment from US Bank lease. We will not be able to proceed until the title is under your name. Unfortunately, because of this we will not be able to accept your trade-in and will need to cancel your delivery for Monday 6/30. I am very sorry for this inconvenience.

I promptly responded to this text but got no response all day.  I’m fairly frustrated.  Any idea if I’m going to be able convince them to let me take delivery tomorrow and if not am I going to lose out on all my incentives?  Anybody have any issues like this with their title and trade in and what was your experience? 

Thanks!

UPDATE: 

Rivian was able to confirm with the DMV this morning that my name was added to the Title so even though I didn’t have the title in hand they allowed for the delivery today as planned! Pheww

Tires - Michelin Defenders
R1S - changed tires from original 21"" Pirellis after 25k miles (not great longevity) to Michelin Defenders last week.  I had read enough online (and TireRack recommends the Michelins) to feel good about the change.  

But I've some issues and wondering if others have any similar. 
1. TireRack now offers mobile install and claims they know how to install on Rivians.  Instead, the installer that showed didn't have pucks (thankfully I had), claimed his speed jack wasn't the right one for the vehicle and could only do one tire, claimed they never enter the vehicle (so had no knowledge of how to set it up for the work so thankfully I had read how to do this) and took nearly 3 hours to do it.  Not great.

2. The install includes mount and balance but the balance is done inside their van. This came back to bite me. I end up with a wiggle in the steering wheel at speeds over 65mph.

Now TireRack is paying to have the wheels rebalanced which I have Rivian do at a SC... They found two tires quite a bit out and improved them.

But, ultimately, the shake is still mildly there. 

Anyone else have issues installing Defenders? "

Just Picked Up My Rivian Dune… After a 3-Week Odyssey Through Paperwork Purgatory 🚙🔥📜
So, I did it. I walked into the showroom, locked eyes with a Rivian Dune, and the rest was history. Took full advantage of the May 30th lease incentive deadline like a true fiscally responsible adventurer. It was impulsive, bold, and oddly romantic. Reader, I bought it.

It’s gorgeous. The kind of gorgeous that makes you forget you’re late for everything because you’re too busy admiring it from every angle. Dune is not just a color—it’s a vibe. It’s the shade of sand you’d ride into battle on. It’s minimalist, muscular, and somehow both earthy and futuristic. I was smitten.

But like every great love story… there was drama.

The car arrived within a week—so fast, it felt like Rivian was trying to impress me. But then came the part where I was supposed to sign everything “at home, at your convenience.” Hah. What ensued was a paperwork maze designed by Kafka and powered by Wi-Fi gremlins. Documents stalled, reps ghosted, and I began to suspect the e-sign process was actually a social experiment in patience.

Then, on the day I was supposed to pick it up—plot twist—I get a call:
“Yeah… so… we’re going to assign you a different VIN. The original one had too many issues.”

Too many what now?

They threw out promises like candy at a parade: “We’ll add $500 to your account!” “We’ll throw in some extras!” “This new one is pristine, we swear!”
Spoiler: The extras? TBD. The $500? Not in my account yet. The speaker.. hasn’t arrived. The shirt and water bottle… nowhere to be seen. 

Three weeks, several passive-aggressive texts, and many “just checking in!” calls later, I finally picked it up yesterday. Was it worth it? Honestly… yes. The car is stunning. Driving it feels like floating in a steel cloud powered by lightning and smug satisfaction.

But would I recommend the process? Only if you enjoy slow-burn psychological thrillers with an unreliable narrator.

Still, here I am: keys in hand, heart full, lease signed, and very ready to never see another ‘team Rivian’ text again.

Happy to answer questions—especially if you’re considering joining the Dune cult. 🌵"

2 months in…
About 2 months in since I got my R1S Dual Max Off-Road package. 
Extremely impressed by the vehicle, as of right now the most expensive car I’ve ever owned, and it feels like it most of the time. 
The interior is amazing, I can’t even imagine what the interior in the Tri and future quad is like if the dual is this nice. BUT, some of the trim seems to have gotten loose since delivery so lots of rattling going around the cabin, no big deal I have an appointment coming up to address that. 

Rides well most of the time but the steering wheel kind of wiggles at an above 50mph, going to get addressed in my appointment. Suspension is okay, not as soft or as great as some other luxury vehicles I been around but it is better than what I have had before. 

Can’t believe there is no massage seats on a +100k car when my buddy with an ID4 of 30k has them. Also blown away by the fact that the back row is not powered to raise of lower like my dad’s 2013 Ford Explorer had back in the day but okay…

Infotainment system is great, a bit laggy but has gotten better from the last two updates. The navigation is a joke, I can’t believe they feel okay with this as a final product. I wish it had Apple Carplay just because of the maps, Apple Music and texting (siri reading texts to me). But I can live without it, my issues with the built in Apple Music app is that it is not good, it never remembers where I was on a playlist or what I was playing last. Also, PLEASE  bring the podcast app into the UI. 

Been off road a few times and it is just crazy how easy it makes it. Going to try some more serious trails this summer along with some Jeep friends and see how it holds up compared to them. 

I have about 9 issues (and counting) being addressed next week on my appointment at the sc. I am more than okay with few issues since they are expected with a new company like Rivian. I do like taking the risk with new companies that could do great in the Future, I have done it with Tonal and Terra Kaffe and so far so good. "

So I’ve had my original PTC (1.0) replaced under warranty to the redesigned version (1.5).

Recently, my PTC fails to close all the way. It closes and touches the tailgate but then opens back up for another 6-8 inches. This triggers a notification in the infotainment to say the PTCis not fully closed.

Meet Bear Claw 🐻! Demo’d in San Diego / Del Mar, CA on Monday, took delivery in Eastvale, CA on Friday
The whole experience exceeded my expectations. I had been following the recent lease deals and decided to do a demo drive while I was on vacation in San Diego. 

Brett at the Del Mar location was super helpful. My wife and I were able to do a 45 minute test drive with our dog around San Diego. This is by far the biggest car we’ve driven, and the big test for me was doing a U-turn at a busy intersection. It was easier than expected!

I put down a deposit in the store immediately afterwards, taking advantage of last week’s promo to get a choice of the speaker, crossbars, or black crossbars (I chose the black crossbars). I also used a friend’s promo code to get the $500 gear credit. 

They found me car in inventory closer to LA that matched the specs I wanted:

- Dual Motor R1S
- Adventure Trim
- Large battery
- Performance upgrade (normally wouldn’t have picked this if I built from scratch)
- El Cap Granite paint
- 22” sport brights
- ocean coast + dark ash
- pano roof
- dark out package
- air compressor 

The lease included the $7500 federal tax credit, $5000 lease offer, $3000 goodwill credit, and I was able to waive the $450 delivery fee since I didn’t pick up in El Segundo and opted to pickup in the Inland Empire at the Eastvale location. They even got me a complementary Lyft ride to make the hour drive. 

I was in and out of the Eastvale plant in less than 45 minutes. Zero issues with the car, it was great the car was inside to avoid doing the pickup checklist and guided walkthrough in the heat. Everyone who worked there was really helpful and genuinely seemed excited which made us more excited!

The crossbars arrived via overnight shipping today and I plan to also install running boards. 

Thanks to everyone in this sub who have posted their experiences and tips, it made this whole process more helpful.

First R1S Road Trip
My wife and I dropped our kids off for a week long summer camp in NC this week.  Had a great week of adventuring and learning more about our 1 mo. old Rivian.  This was a test run for our upcoming 1000-mile road trip to Michigan next week, and my confidence has only grown.

Coming from a ER Ford Lightning every use case for us is better in the Rivian.  I have no regrets, my family feels safer and more comfortable.  I even tested some light off-road capabilities doing some 15° climbs on range wheels with ease! The range is great our (300+ mile return home did not require a charge) and the software is 1000x better. 

One issue: my NACS adapter is hanging up on the locking pin.  I have a service ticket in, but it might be a fitment issue that seems to be improving with a little wear. I have a ticket in if it doesn’t go away, but the Rivian CCS plug worked okay and pushing down on the handle allowed the latch to clear the pin.  Anyone else have this experience?  Could a little sand paper on my adapter be the solution?"

2024 R1S had a surprise liftgate opening while in a pull-thru car wash. The car was in park, and I turned on car wash mode since the charging hatch had popped open previously in the same car wash.

[Rant] Terrible Sales Experience with Rivian – Escalation Needed and No Support
Hey everyone,  
I wanted to share my experience in case others are going through something similar or can offer advice.

I placed an order for a Rivian R1S on **6/23/25** and was assisted by a sales rep. Initially, everything seemed smooth—he even mentioned he could get me approved for additional incentives, which I appreciated. That’s what ultimately convinced me to place the order.

Unfortunately, from that point on, everything fell apart.

# 🚨 Missed Meetings and No Communication

The sales rep has **missed 3 separate meetings** I scheduled through his Calendly. I’ve called him, texted, emailed—no response. I even called the **888-Rivian** number, only to be **hung up on** once. When I called back, someone finally said I’d get a follow-up call… that never came.

# 🚨 Pricing Discrepancies and Missing Incentives

He submitted a ticket for the incentives on Monday, but the **lease cost is still incorrect** and **the incentives are not being properly applied** on the vehicle summary page. 

Here’s what I’m seeing:

# 🔹 Vehicle Summary Screen:

* Vehicle Price: **$95,150**
* **Total Incentives:** Should be **$17,000**, broken down as:
   * Lease Promo: $5,000
   * Trade-in Promo: $3,000
   * EV Lease Credit: $7,500
   * Other: $1,500
* **Expected Adjusted Price:** **$78,150**
* But right now, **none of those incentives are reflected** in the Vehicle Summary.

# 🔹 Leasing Page:

* Lease Option: 36 months / 10K miles / 740+ credit / $0 down
* Monthly Payment Shown: **$995.24**
* Vehicle Price Shown: **$92,450** — **this doesn’t match either the $95,150 MSRP or the expected $78,150 after incentives.**

I’m scheduled to **pick up the vehicle this Sunday morning**, and Rivian’s own process requires everything to be finalized **the day before**. I’m actively trying to follow their instructions but **can’t get the help I need** to fix these basic issues.

  
If anyone here knows who I can escalate this to—or has tips on how to get through to someone competent—I would be incredibly grateful. This has been one of the most frustrating sales experiences I’ve ever had with any company, let alone a premium EV brand.

Thanks for reading and any advice is appreciated."

Rivian experience
Sharing to shed light. 

I've realized that Rivian, particularly on the service center side, isn't the most ideal workplace. As a Manager at a large service center, the environment is quite chaotic. My team often calls in sick, not because they are ill, but due to being overworked and burnt out. Unfortunately, my manager is indifferent to this situation, continually pushing and pivoting without regard for staff well-being.

In my short tenure as a mgr, I haven't received formal Rivian training beyond RLN. I frequently work nearly 60 hours a week. Despite consistently covering for three managers, my abilities are constantly questioned. Although we supposedly have unlimited vacation, it's more of a myth; for instance, I had to cancel my days off when an employee couldn't make it to work. Even when a family member required support for a serious medical condition, I was pressured to keep working.

Managing the team has brought about numerous HR cases and unfounded claims of sexism and being ""mean."" HR even investigated a claim simply for holding an employee accountable. Fortunately, I've been vindicated in each instance, thanks to keeping detailed records. Despite years of management experience, I've never had such frequent HR interactions before. The situation has worsened to the point where disciplining team members is daunting, as it often becomes a time-consuming HR issue. This has compelled me to maintain a daily diary of all activities, a necessity arising from fabricated claims that we are neither available nor productive.

I don’t mind adapting to changes, but they often occur without proper communication, contributing to the team's burnout. Consequently, when given a task, there's little motivation to care, and fear of reprisals makes accountability challenging.

Upper management focuses solely on metrics, mistakenly assuming we aren’t doing our jobs, rather than understanding our struggles firsthand. Yes, metrics provide insight, but a one-size-fits-all approach doesn't suit every service center. The center I manage handles a massive volume beyond available manpower, forcing us to be resourceful and devise new strategies to improve throughput.

Overall, this ongoing game damages customer experience. We end up with more dissatisfied customers than happy ones, with no resolution in sight.

AppleMusic Bug
TL;DR - there a bug when trying to connect your AppleMusic sub. The engineers are aware, there is a solution, and they should be rolling out a bug fix soon. 

I took delivery of a new R1T Gen2 today and then went to connect my AppleMusic sub. When I tapped on the Sign In button it would go to a load screen for a second then redirect me back to screen to tap the Signin button. 

I did:

1. Tried to sign in on WiFi but no connect+ sub
2. Signed up for Connect+, soft reset, connected to WiFi, then tried to sign in again
3. Turned off WiFi and tried to sign in again
4. Soft reset, turn off WiFi, tried to sign in again
5. Hard reset then tried to sign in on WiFi
6. Hard reset then tried to sign in on cellular

After step 6 I went back inside and got a service tech. Ran through the various steps again so they could see, he then took those details and passed it onto the appropriate dev team. For a text 2 hours after leaving that a solution has been found and a fix will be pushed out soon. 

Pretty quick turnaround that I’m impressed with. Just wanted to share in case others are facing this issue too "

Need help identifying the source of noise coming from driver side
This is a Gen2 R1S that I got in 2024 and the noise comes on intermittently at speed around 40m/h. At the time of last maintenance, Rivian could not replicate it during test drive and left it unaddressed. I am aware that rattling noise has been a common issue on these vehicles so I am hoping that good folks on here can help identify the source before I go to service center next. "

Picking up my R1S Dune tomorrow in NY.  Advice needed on what to look out for before accepting delivery.
Super excited but also nervous given the build quality issues that everyone talks about - but couldn't pass up an additional 8k discount in addition to the evaporating 7500 lease credit so I pulled the trigger.  I have the famous print out checklist posted on here many times before but if anyone has any other must do inspection points, I'd appreciate any advice on what to look out for.  Thanks!!!"

Resetting on Road Trips
On our first road trip and experienced an issue on the Rivian Adventure Network where the R1S (Gen2) required a reset between each charging stop. 

After plugging into the second RAN charger, the charger produced a “Connecting” message but then prompted me to unplug and try again, which didn’t work. I tried all four chargers at the RAN and then called Rivian. 

The (awesome) support person advised that I should reset the car, and that if I’m on a road trip, I should anticipate having to continue to do so. And sure enough, I had to reset at the next RAN stop to be able to charge. 

Is this … normal? "

Update V 2025.18.01 Nav/Map issues
Has the mapping world been hit by a solar flare? I can't Plan a Trip in the Rivian app, i get a ""Couldn't plan a trip"" error. Tried to create trip in  the PlugShare and ABRP app with the same issues. Went to Google Maps thinking i could plan a trip there and share it to the Rivian...no joy. Anyone else seeing this? I've soft and hard booted the truck  and deleted and reinstalled the app. Still no success. "

Cancelled Rivian R1S order :(
Pretty bummed, but ended up cancelling my recent R1S purchase. Long story short, the California Dunes vehicle assigned to me arrived at the delivery center with a few dents and paint defects. The delivery center manager was incredibly patient and understanding with my frustrations, but also politely said that this may not be the right vehicle for me :(

You can read more on that post here:  
[https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1lki6e9/upcoming\_delivery\_issues/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1lki6e9/upcoming_delivery_issues/)

Given it was going to be impossible to take delivery of an alternative CD model before 6/30, we agreed to cancel. Here's to hoping for some good incentives in July!

UPDATE 1: I called them back yesterday as I still really want this CD model and given there is no chance of getting another similar vehicle before 6/30, I don’t have much choice. I do think incentives will be the same or better next month (or offset with a much better MF), but need a car sooner than later. 

That said, they are now telling me they will no longer do complimentary home delivery and that I have to pick the car up physically. This is complete BS given the free home delivery was offered less than 24hrs ago. In fact they are saying they won’t do home delivery on any vehicle I choose this month. To me, this is extremely dishonest and unprofessional. Complete joke…

UPDATE!!! Well the stars have aligned. They located another vehicle for me that I took delivery of today! Took a one way flight to SF and drove it home! What an awesome car. So many things to explore, but really happy they did the right thing.

Upcoming Delivery Issues!
I just received word that my California Dunes R1S arrived at the delivery center with minor dents on multiple door panels and a few paint defects on the front fascia. I'm being told that taking delivery of another available CD vehicle before 6/30 is NOT possible. It sounds like these issues were during transit, and I know things can happen...

I proposed a few resolutions with the delivery center and was essentially told NO for most of them:

1. Delivery of another CD model before (or after) 6/30 with the same rebates and pricing. Sounds like the concern here is getting another vehicle delivered before 6/30 is unlikely, and taking delivery after 6/30 would lose the $7500 EV lease credit. 

2. Taking delivery of an alternative color vehicle, but with AT package, for SAME price as the CD. This requires additional discounts to make the numbers work as this is a $10k additional MSRP cost. I was told no further discounts, and it was not possible to meet in the middle. This means another $350/mo for what is basically the same car but with Ascend interior. CRAZY!

3. I proposed having the vehicle repaired and then delivered to my home (200 miles away from delivery center) free of charge through their official home delivery program. This means I have t pay my minimum $$ DAS before delivery, but allows me the ability to refuse delivery should the repairs not be to my satisfaction.

4. Cancel my order. 

  
Realistically, it sounds like options 3 and 4 are the only feasible ones. I am waiting to hear if they will deliver the car to my home at no charge. For option 4, they did say they would refund my deposit but that is not ideal, as I need a car. 

I'm super bummed and a bit frustrated, as their proposed resolutions and willingness to work on this are starting to feel a lot like my experience with Tesla in the past - and one of the biggest reasons I left. I'm pretty meticulous and have no idea what to do. "

Is my R1S possessed?
So I’m currently on a flight listening to Spotify on Bluetooth headphones at 30000ish feet in the air. All of a sudden, my output source switches to my R1S, and the music changes to a playlist I’ve never once listened to (“Brazilian Summer Vibes”). Is my Rivian possessed or is it just asking me to take my cat on a road trip to Brazil? 

I live alone and it’s parked in my garage. No one has access to it, and it’s not connected to my home WiFi. It’s had Spotify issues before where it changes the songs while I’m driving alone without touching the controls or my phone "

Breaker at home heated up to 165°F charging new Gen 2. Anyone else dealt with this before?
New Rivian owner and long time EV driver here. Recently picked up a Gen 2 R1S and for the first time I’ve had my breaker trip while charging an EV on my (also Gen 2 Tesla Wall Connector). 

This happened a few times and I just thought that it was an issue with the car communicating with the charger/adaptor when plugged in at 48amps. To resolve this issue I reduced the charging speed to 40amps and everything was fine. Switched over to an 80amp max rated adaptor and then tried out 48amps again, but after 20mins the circuit breaker tripped again. What was new this time was a distinct almost fishy smell in the garage. Opened the panel to fully shut off the 60amp breaker tied to my charger and it was incredibly hot, so I brought out my temp gauge and it heated up to nearly 165°. 

Long story short, called my electrician and they said the smell and tripping was from the breaker overheating and ultimately getting burned out. They replaced it right away and I’m able to get a consistent charge as of now (only been 1 day since the replacement was installed).

I’ve noticed that on the Rivian the panel is still heating up quite a bit compared to the 8+ yrs I’ve charged other cars at 48amps. Has anyone else had this happen? I’m mainly wondering if the issue has something to do with my charge port and if anyone has had theirs replaced on the car for an improper pin connection since something is likely up with my car. 

Also on that note of a possible pin connection issue, my car has consistently had the J1772 plugs at work get “stuck” where the car will say charging has stopped with the white eject light on and it won’t release the handle. Tried 4 stalls and the same thing keeps happening so I’m officially a stuck charging plug troubleshooting expert now lol. 

Already have a SC appt scheduled for next week on a bunch of other minor issues but if anyone has dealt with a similar problem I’d be interested to know how it was resolved so I can go into my appt with knowledge on what worked for others if I get the Rivian equivalent of Tesla SC’s dreaded “within spec” response. Thanks!! "

If You’re Thinking of Getting a R1, I would be very cautious
This isn’t meant to be a hate post, I really wanted to love this car. Bought an R1S last year and it’s been nothing but trouble. We’re on our 7th issue now with service wait times exceeding 8 weeks. Also, somehow the software has gotten worse. Yes we finally did get Video Casting and Apple Music but it came at the expense of a stable software. I have to soft reboot at least once a week because of issues with the navigation system. 

I know there’s a ton of Rivian fans out there who will claim they have had zero issues and the love their rig, which is awesome; Just be aware that if you have any issues (which is very likely, just look at the consumer reports chart of service claims in the first year) you’re in for a long and frustrating wait. Also, the customer service has really been lackluster lately. My first issue or two I had they really went through extra mile. The last issue I had which was charging cable related (The cable stopped working so I could no longer charge) they weren’t sympathetic at all and after 2 weeks they ended up shipping it to the wrong address and were like “sorry not our problem…” 

Sorry for the rant, it’s just I see so many curious people asking about Rivian, and I really wanted to love it, but it’s been arguably the worst vehicle I’ve owned in a long time "

Charging issue

I’ve been doing a bit of travel this month and have had to stop at various chargers. During my last session, I stopped at a Tesla Supercharger. I initiated the charge through the Tesla app, got out of my vehicle, and plugged in my R1S.

Somehow, Rivian’s Plug & Charge system took over the session. The Tesla rate was $0.35/kWh, but I ended up being billed by Rivian at $0.52/kWh.

Did I do something wrong, or is this a software bug?

Also worth noting—Rivian closed my support ticket without any explanation or back-and-forth. As someone who loves the brand, that was a bit disappointing.

Just Picked Up: Initial Impressions and Questions
Just picked up this blue beast and it was definitely an interesting experience with the pickup process. My initial thoughts and questions coming from a Model 3:

- Panel alignment is a little better than Tesla, but my hood is still misaligned and needs a service ticket.

- So many swirl marks everywhere on the clear coat. Do they wash these cars with sandpaper prior to delivery? A couple of spots where paint came off as well. They’ll need correction with a service ticket. Debating getting ceramic coating done just to get paint polished to remove the swirl marks. Really not great at this price point. 

- The door handles and central locking is REALLY loud. There’s literally a thud when the car gets put into gear. Of course the door handles squeak too. Another service ticket. 

- Car feels like it wanders a bit at speed. Is this normal or does the car need another alignment?

- AC compressor or fans vibrate the steering wheel at higher power. Haven’t felt vibrations through a steering wheel like this since driving ICE cars 20 years ago. neither of my Teslas have this issue. Is this something people have had luck getting fixed? Probably the most disappointing part of the experience driving the car. 

- Software isn’t too far behind Teslas for the most part. They just need to work on app support, navigation, and maybe rethink some of the UI as far as placement of info on the screen and sub menus. Took Tesla years to get where they are from a software perspective so I have confidence that Rivian can do it. Just copy the features Tesla has now to catch up and then think about innovating. 

- Interior is much higher end feeling than Model3/Y but doors require a fair bit of force to close and don’t really have a solid sound like a thunk; more like a rattle. Kind of disappointing at this price point. 

- Range estimates seem to be more accurate so far compared to Teslas calculations which is a welcome change. 

- Second and third row functions are hard for my 9 and 7 year olds so I have to help them with putting seats up and down and sliding them. Would have been nice if a little more thought was put into these mechanism to make it easier for smaller sized people. Power seats would solve this problem. 

Overall the R1S is a very nice vehicle but maybe less impressive if you’re already used to driving an EV. Hopefully service will address the little niggles and software updates will add some more impactful features. I noticed at pickup that the majority of trade ins were Tesla Model 3 or Y (myself included). The real litmus test will be road trips and DC fast charging. I’m hoping it’ll be just as easy and as fast as it was with Teslas.

Supercharger Rates
I’ve mostly been charging at home and work since I took delivery last October. 

Last week I needed to head down from Northern NJ to Lewes DE for my mom though and ran into some annoyances. First she has a wawa right by her home that I knew has superchargers from when I had my Model 3 but after trying to use them with the Rivian we found that they were “Tesla only”. I didn’t think that was even a thing but after plugging in and not getting it to work we saw a sign that said as much. This location also didn’t come up on my dashboard app. Instead the dashboard was navigating me to another wawa a few towns over. 

Not the end of the world but pointing out that apparently not all superchargers work with Rivian. Apologies if this is common knowledge but it was a first for me anyway. 

In Bear DE we charged no problem. It was fast. I got some delicious Wawa coffee and we moved on. But the annoyance here was the price. I was charging up at around 1130am on a weekday and it ended up costing about $20 more than the same % charge I did at another supercharger closer to home in NJ on another day. Are electricity rates in DE really that high compared to NJ???  When I supercharged in Jersey it was around 1030a also on a weekday. Has anyone else noticed wildly fluctuating prices like this?

Minor gripes. I love my R1S and am very happy with it as is my family. 

Next time I visit my mom tho I’m not filling up in DE.

Just picked up my R1S Max Saturday - thoughts from a first time EV owner
Excited to join the community.  Had my Jeep Grand Cherokee for 10 years and was hesitant on going full EV due to the drastic change it would be from a 18 mpg suv, learning where charging stations are, not knowing which brand is the best, etc.  That all went out the window when I test drove the R1S.  Basically that day I had 4 other appointments scheduled to try other ev and hybrid cars and cancelled all of them hahaha.

  
Anyway - as a first timer I've noticed some of the posts on this sub are from owners who are pretty used to this type of vehicle/technology and I just wanted to throw in my two cents as someone going into this completely blind:

  
1.  Performance/Drive - holy shit is this car smooth.  I cannot believe an suv of this size and weight moves around this quickly.  I feel like I'm in complete control whether on the highway or curvy local roads.  Normal mode is already WAY faster than what I'm used to, and sports mode seems like it should be illegal haha.  Seriously my daughter and I got tunnel vision going from start to 60mph on a straight road in about 3 seconds.  I'm actually no stranger to fast cars either having driven v12's in the past with some frequency, but this just feels different I don't know.  Maybe because of the size of the car or the torque of electric, but damn it's nuts.

  
2.  Technology - i mean, obviously I'm going to hype up the user interface because again I'm going from a 2016 jeep, but it feels like I've stepped 20 years in the future.  It's almost a problem because I can't stop messing around with the screen and all the apps/options which of course gets me yelled at by my nervous wife.  And I opted for just the regular 11 speaker sound system which got me a little nervous from seeing posts on this sub about it's quality issues.  That said, I'd give the sound system a 8/10.  I like a lot of rock like smashing pumpkins, toadies, etc, and the distorted guitars sound a little muddled on this system, though I found a nice guide for equalizer settings that has helped immensely.  Smoother, more melodic music like Radiohead or Billie Eilish seems to play perfectly on the system.  I've also tried the casting feature which is just a nice bonus on top of everything else - especially when my wife and two girls are shopping and I'm just sitting there hahaha.

  
3.  Interior - great stitching, really spacious, and the 3rd row seating is going to be perfect for a drive to Maine we have planned next month.  Shit, I'd drive this car cross country if my family could stand to be in the car that long.  It's just a comfortable space to chill in.  I'm a sort of tall guy at 6'2"" and I feel very accommodated inside.

  
4.  Charging/Range - haven't had much experience with this yet, as I am still waiting to get my wall charger delivered and installed.  I did plug it into a regular outlet in my garage from around 6pm last night to 7am this morning and gained about 42 miles but definitely looking forward to the wall charger.  The range on the max is fantastic.  Started at the dealership on Saturday with about 390 miles and did a ton of driving back home, back out, into NYC, over to queens, random little trips to shops from my house, etc etc and I ended yesterday evening with about 255 miles left.  I will say any fears I had about being anxious or worried constantly about my range have dissipated. 

  
Anyway that's my two cents.  I can't stop thinking about this car and I feel the need to drive it constantly.  I'm very happy with this brand so far and definitely keeping my eye on that R3 because that style is badass though this R1 is really nice to look at, and I may just keep this one for another 10 years instead!"

Took delivery today! Exciting but rocky start..
Took delivery today (also my birthday!) of my Rivian Blue R1S Dual Performance Max. Absolutely love the look of it and it’s beautiful! Delivery process was fine, but I’ve had a few hiccups since this morning…

First of all, 5 minutes after I left I got on the highway and had a rock hit the windshield. Quarter size starburst. My wife and I sat with our jaws dropped in disbelief. Thankfully I was able to get some same day service to get it filled. Spent most the day stressed hoping it wouldn’t spread, but life happens I guess!

My second hiccup has been at home.. pulled out the portable charger to test it out and lo and behold the thing got stuck in the port. Tried about everything including infotainment reset, lock & unlock repeatedly while wiggling the handle, etc. Nothing budged. Finally I pulled up the trim to get the manual release latch and it worked! Of course I then tried to use the charger again to see if it was a one time fluke but unfortunately it got stuck again and I had to use the manual release latch again.. about to go test out the local DCFC nearby just to see what that yields.. hoping it is a problem with the charger cord and not the car itself…

Update 1: Can confirm after every successful charge I have to use the emergency release under the trim to disconnect the charger. Level 2 or DCFC. I’m speculating that it’s something someone commented below about the locking mechanism actuator not releasing. When I tried the “lock and unlock a bunch of times while wiggling the charger” method, I can hear something going on inside but nothing happening. And the button on the charger kinda depresses and gets stuck.

Used the chatbot to schedule a service appointment on June 26, then my local SC (Memphis) called the next day to get more details and moved me up to June 20. Sounded like it could take less than an hour to fix but if not they would provide me alternative transportation. Will update in the future!

They also said “once the manual charger release switch has been pulled, it has to be replaced. But you’re fine to continue using it until it is fixed.” TIL.

Update 2: Went in to service appointment on June 20 and they told me they could not replicate the issue which was incredibly weird considering that it has happened to me like 90% of the time. They told me the next time it happens I should take a video and a diagnostic timestamp by tap & holding on my name on the main screen. They also said the portable charger they gave me didn't seem to be acting right, so they gave me a new one.

Sure enough, the very next day, June 21, it happened again with my portable charger and supercharger with NACS adapter. Took videos and timestamps this time and scheduled another appointment for July 1. On June 25 they called me and said there was a cancellation and they could see me the next day.

Once I got there, me and the service tech that I just saw last week took a trip to the same supercharger with both mine & his NACS adapter. He said from the vehicle diagnostics, they were not seeing any red flags or anything they would normally see. He asked me to replicate what I do at the supercharger. Got everything charging and said, ""well, usually I would then walk away and the car would lock."" So this time I locked the car for about 10 seconds and unlocked it and **that** was what made the adapter get stuck. Both my adapter and his. He didn't actually know what the problem was. He gave me a loaner and said he would get back with me once he had more info. He said if they have to replace the charging mechanism, they'll have to order the parts.

The next day he calls and tells me they didn't actually need to replace anything and it was good to be picked up! Turns out the actuation motor was working fine and still locking the pin in place, but somehow the pin had been set up to a point where it would come too far out during the lock and not fully retract when unlocked. He said all they had to do was readjust it and it was fixed! We all learned something new.

Overall, I'm very pleased with the service here in Memphis! Everyone was kind and patient with me, provided loaners, etc."

R1S Charging Port Stuck Open
This morning I came out to my 2025 R1S (delivered April 2025) and the charging port would not close. The app shows that there’s an obstacle in the way but there’s not obvious impeding it from closing. I restarted the vehicle and that did not help resolve the problem. 

Has anyone had a similar issue and found a way to resolve it? "

Tell me why I should NOT buy a R1S
My family and I are currently in the market for a 3 row SUV and we're interested in exploring options. My wife and I are already leaning towards he R1S because we like the brand theme and the features it has.

 Currently considering the R1S tri motor. Picked this over the dual motor since we wanted the extra options... and the Slate Sky only comes with the tri-motor packages and above. Im about a half hour away from the nearest service center, with the next one about 45 minutes away in the opposite direction. 

  
There are some concerns I have o the R1S and I want to know what the community thinks of the car in detail and wether or not you'd suggest/convince someone looking for a car with these criteria:

  
1. 3-Row with the 3rd row being able to comfortable sit someone 6' tall as reference height

2. Spacious cargo capacity for family items (stroller + cooler) maybe even consider carry ons for long road trips 

3. Range - large battery pack/range numbers were what led me to rule out the EV9s/Vistiqs, Id like to be able to go long stretches of drives without needing to make a stop, or at least I can make stops/explore areas that don't have charging stations and not have range anxiety.

\----

  
Other cars considered:

  
1. Volvo EX90 - Going to test drive it today. Apparently, ti has more of a focus on luxury/comfort for everyday use. Strong + in the sound department but the big drawbacks I find for it is the 3rd row not being amazing and unfortunately, I really do need to have functional 3rd row. 

2. Lexus 700h - More of the ""safety pick"" hoping that the reputation of reliability still stands this day for Lexus models especially at this price point.

Far 3. Lucid Gravity - Ticks a lot of good boxes for me, I just wish I didn't have to wait 6-9 months to get it....

  
\----

  
Some questions I have for the R1S. 

**Offroad Package**  
I plan to get the offroad package purely for the 20"" wheels... so that eventually I can switch for it to 20"" all season tires so I can get better ride comfort ... and for better options/price. I personally also like the idea of the additional underbody protection.. 

I plan to take the car to parks/campgrounds etc, but maybe like 5-8 times a year? Havent decided yet if Im wiling to take a 6 figure car out off roading yet. 

  
**How bad is the sound system really?**

Im reading a lot of owners are frustrated about the quality of the in-house audio. Is it really that bad? Or is it coming from the expectation that because this is a $100k+ car, that it should be really good? Can the problem be fixed via software or is this also a hardware-related issue? 

  
**High Mileage Maintenance and Serviceability**

I know no vehicle is BIFL, but I am coming into this with the intention of wanting to own this, and be able to drive it, for at least 10 years. Our family recent cars was a Mazda 6, CRV, and a Equinox, non of us had ever experienced owning a vehicle that was even close to over $30,000, so moving into a vehicle that is more than 3x the cost of what we're used to, a lot of these experience are going to feel expensive.

How has Rivian service been to you as customers and were they able to take care of your vehicles at reasonable time frames? Whats the cost of repair once out of warranty for big items like the air suspension, motor, battery packs? 

I read ""Air Suspension"" and I already am wondering how troublesome would this be to replace? 

  
\-----

  
Overall, I love the idea of the R1S, I love the brand and what its moving to. Given my needs for a vehicle, does the R1S make sense or should I consider another vehicle instead?

Does Level 2 charging raise your battery temp?
Recently purchased a 2023 R1S used. I noticed that Level 2 charging (between 5-8 kW at home and at work) raises the battery temperature from \~70F degrees to 93-95F degrees in the first few hours of charging. The ambient temperature is 60-70F. Any of you experiencing this?

Last night I ran an experiment at home with my \~7.5 kW Chargepoint home charger and data is in the image.

Edit: Consensus seems to say this isn't a problem. Love the car and this community is awesome! Thanks all, and keep adventuring!

The Joy is Gone….
TLDR; service centers either don’t fix problems or create more… a 2+ year reflection…

If you want to see my previous issues, check my post history….

When I first received my Rivian, I was filled with joy and excitement. It was everything I hoped for in a vehicle—innovative, bold, and part of something new. But since 2022, that excitement has steadily eroded. Every single visit to a Rivian service center has either failed to fix the original issue or resulted in a new one being introduced.

Most recently, a recurring leak reappeared on my floor mats—nine months after the air conditioner was supposedly repaired. That original issue involved a cracked unit leaking into the cabin. This time, the cause turned out to be improper installation: holes in the firewall were letting water in. It’s incredibly frustrating that such a critical fix wasn’t done correctly the first time.

I was told I could pick up my vehicle last Friday. That was pushed to Saturday morning. When I arrived—with my children—I was told it still wasn’t ready because a part had broken during installation. The repair was delayed again until today. When I finally got the truck back, I learned Rivian had failed to inform Enterprise to extend the rental car, and I was contacted directly by Enterprise saying I would now be responsible for several days of charges.

This led to another exhausting back-and-forth with Rivian. The inability to contact service centers directly means what should be a three-minute call turns into a 90-minute engagement through remote messaging queues.

To top it off: after picking up my children from school, a piece of trim fell off the vehicle by the window. My son was holding the trim against the truck to keep it from flying off into traffic down the highway.  *sigh* I now have another appointment scheduled—this time with Rivian’s mobile service—to address that.

I’ve been to Rivian service centers in Richmond, Gaithersburg, and Glen Burnie. Sadly, all of them have been disappointing. This doesn’t seem to be an issue with the individual staff members; it feels systemic—procedures and processes at Rivian are broken.

The worst part? I no longer have joy when I drive this truck. I was so excited to be an early adopter. I knew there would be bugs. For the first two years, I gave a lot of grace. But instead of things getting better, service has declined.

I don’t know what to do anymore. I’m deeply disappointed. What was once my dream vehicle has become a source of stress and frustration. And now, I’m seriously questioning whether I can keep it much longer.

Honestly, how long to we support a company that systemically isn’t necessarily improving?"

Anyone aware of a solution to charge a Rivian only on excess solar energy?
We have a solar system from Tesla, (powerwall, batteries etc) - and one of the reasons we bought it because it allows us to charge out cars (currently Teslas) from excess solar energy - IE after the house batteries are full, any excess not used for house load goes into the car. With two EV's to cycle between this means we never charge from the grid, or deplete the house batteries. It's a really nice setup. We're interested in moving to a Rivian, but the lack of ability to charge from excess solar is a really hard hurdle to get over. We really don't want to use our batteries, or grid charge. I'm not opposed to writing software to get over this problem, if there's a charger with an API I can use control energy output. I have access to all our load information in real-time in Home Assistant. Is anyone aware of a solution, or have any recommendation on chargers or another avenue to explore? "

Max pack overheat
UPDATE:  the south San Francisco service center team rocks. They took our S in, fixed it, and drove it over 100 miles back to us before we had to drive back home. I’m so thankful for their work and willingness to help us out. We were staying in a place with no Ubers, rentals, busses, etc. shout out to them! 

Took my dune R1S out for its first ever road trip from Oregon to California today. Absolutely horrendous experience with the battery. After the first DC charging session the battery temperature spiked at 130° and basically stayed around there for the next several
Hours of driving and attempted charging. It seemed like the vehicle was making little to no attempt to cool the battery and it turned what should have been an 11 hour trip into an 18 hour trip. Turtle mode on the highway twice and DC charging speeds at a whopping 0.6kw. I know it was hot today but my previous gen 1 experience was never impacted like this in heat. The vehicle was literally undriveable for three hours while it sat in the shade refusing to run its fans to cool the battery. I sincerely hope there’s a fixable problem with my particular vehicle and this isn’t just what they’ve built these cars to do in heat. "

Second stupidest design decision on R1t
Ok for starters, this truck has been amazing. I very much enjoy driving it and think that the team has made mostly smart decisions with the design of the truck and features. However, this top piece of the tailgate has to be the second worst aspect of the truck (first is the phone charging pad). Last week my water heater finally bit the dust. Luckily I was able to find one at my local Lowe’s and went down to get it. Loaded it just fine and got it home no problem. Unfortunately, trying to get it out of the bed meant tilting the water heater over the edge to let the bottom go down and use the tip of the bed as a fulcrum. Apparently the truck was never designed to actually use the tailgate so the top trim ripped right off. Now it is going to cost me ~$250 to get it replaced.  I guess I am fortunate that they had a mobile service appointment in the relative near future. 

I still don’t understand how this made it through production without anyone calling it out as a bad design "

The Unluckiest EV owner in the World.
Just wanted to share with the world my crazy and non representative EV truck experience of the last 2.5 years. 

In December 2022 I took delivery of a R1T Quad in Rivian blue. It was my dream car, I got the early order pricing and I was thrilled with it. 

It was not my first EV, I came from an early build Model Y but it was a huge upgrade. It reminded me of my old blue Tacoma but offering the performance, tech, and comfort that I never thought I could afford. 

Sadly it kept going into service. Roughly every 2-3 months it would spend between 11-23 days in service at a time. Everything from rattles, squeaks, leaking hydraulics, leaking air suspension, replacing rear both drive units, etc. Despite all this I stuck with it, it met my States requirements as a lemon in my first year of ownership but I just toughed it out. My fiancée was running out of patience with my truck as every service trip required me driving over an hour one way just to drive an enterprise rental for two weeks. 

The final straw came as I got to take a once in a lifetime month long road trip across the West. I drove from the East coast to Colorado and all over Utah. I got to do some amazing off roading, camping, and hiking. Sadly, during that trip I noticed a bad musty smell. I figured it might be the evaporator coils, something many Tesla owners are familiar with. Not a big deal but annoying. The smell kept getting worse though. Finally on a stop where I pulled out the floor mats to clean them I noticed the drivers floor was soaked and probably had mold growing. The AC was draining into the cabin. The mold was especially concerning because I am allergic to indoor molds, but at least I figured out why I was sick for most of the trip. I tried to get the truck into the Denver service center and then the Colorado Springs service center. Colorado Springs was able to get me in but they said it would likely take 14 days to repair because they would have to replace the entire heater core along with removing most of the carpeting and sanitizing underneath it. I decided at that point to return back to the East coast, have my regular service center fix it and then try and continue the second half of the trip. 

When I was about 400 miles away from home at a charging stop in Ohio I happened to notice my rear tire treads seemed low, which was weird because I put fresh tires in before I left on the trip. Upon inspection I found both rear tires treads were completely worn down to the metal cords on the inner part of both tires. 

I decided to slightly air down the tires and basically try to limp home at 50 mph. I made it about 70 miles from home when one of those tires failed and I had the truck towed to Rivian from the side of the highway. I have a full size spare but the other tire was close to failure as well. This was the straw that broke the camels back. The truck recently had an alignment done, I had done off roading but nothing that should result in a severe misalignment to cause this. Rivian had replaced both rear drive units before I left on the trip but I am not sure if the tire exploding was related to that. What troubled me more was that if I hadn’t had glanced at my rear tires I would have never known there was a problem. The tire could have exploded with me going full speed down the highway. There was no steering wheel shake or other tell. 

At that point I asked Rivian to buy the truck back. It kicked off a long process that went back forth but finally we came to an agreement despite the truck being too old for the formal lemon process. 

I decided I still wanted an EV truck. I was not going to get a Cybertruck because my fiancée would leave me and I did not want all the negative attention, plus at the time they were over $100k. I decided to go with a Ford Lightning because it was a simpler suspension set up, and I just figured it would be more reliable and easier to access service. I did the dealership dance and got a killer deal. I drove the Lightning for about few days and then noticed after dropping off some pavers and mulch for my Mom that the front of the roof between the windshield and the moon roof had deep scratches and dents. I figured out immediately this damage must’ve come from the car carrier. I picked up the truck at night and despite using a two page delivery checklist from the Lightning forums I missed the damage. The dealer did offer to fix it in their body shop for free. I was annoyed, I did not want a brand new truck that had body work off the bat but they weren’t going to take it back. I brought it in for them to repair. 

Two weeks into that repair I got a notification in the Ford App that were was a battery/powertrain malfunction. I hoped this was just a glitch or a result of the dealer having to disable the HV system while doing body work. Sadly their service department then confirmed it was indeed a bad battery module. They would have to drop the pack and replace the module. I took that as a sign and requested a buyback. Ford initially refused but I sent a frustrated email to the Ford CEOs public email about the dealer and the entire experience. To Fords credit a member of the executive office reached out to me and took over the buy back case personally. She got it done and that was that with the Lightning. 

At this point I made a decision that many would say is crazy. I went back to Rivian. I just loved the brand and there is truly nothing like the truck. I knew my truck was a lemon and hoped lightning would not strike twice. I ended up leasing a Tri Max R1T in Rivian Blue. Now 5 months into ownership its getting ready for its second service trip. Alignment problems, rattles, sound system rattles/resonance. 

I still have to drive over an hour but at least this time I got a loaner. An early VIN R1T. Worked flawlessly for the 11 days I had it…

I truly do not think my experience is representative but maybe the universe is telling me I shouldn’t drive an EV truck. "

Should I be concerned?
I've been waiting on Carmax to fix some issues with an R1S I'm trying to buy for almost a month (full story so far can be found in my comments here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1kkvwrw/comment/mryaa1z/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=web3x&utm\_name=web3xcss&utm\_term=1&utm\_content=share\_button](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1kkvwrw/comment/mryaa1z/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button) )

This has given me time to think about some things that have me concerned.

1. The car has sat on the lot since approximately mid-October, and based on the vehicle history report, it's only been driven about 100 miles since last June. According to Carmax, the reason it's sat so long is somebody left a door open and the 12V battery died, so they needed to have a new 12V installed. I assume it's a good thing that it has a new 12V battery, but should I be concerned that the vehicle has sat for nearly a year now with (presumably) little to no regular charging cycles or use?
2. Based on #1, is there anything I should check when I do finally get to take it for my 24-hour test drive? Any way to test the battery/range health? Any other potential issues based on it sitting unused for so long?
3. Rivian will be back for the 3rd time today or tomorrow to try to recalibrate the sensors after Safelite replaced the windshield. During the first attempt, they determined it needed a new wheel speed sensor. Came back a week later to replace the wheel sensor and that didn't fix the problem, so now they will be trying a new wiring harness of some sort. Am I wrong to fell like they should be better prepared to troubleshoot and fix issues on the spot?
4. The VIN is less than 10,000 - any common ""bugs"" I should look out for on such an early production model?

Current Model Years missing from the ChargePoint app?
Has anyone else found the ChargePoint app doesn’t appear to have the 2025 model years available for Rivians? None of the R1S trims get younger than 2023 in my app while only the generic R1T gets to 2024.  

I’m on iOS and the app claims to be up-to-date. 

Perhaps this is a non-issue. But if I set my EV in the app to be a “2023 R1S Adventure Package,” could that be a problem because my actual 2025 model has a different battery size/composition?"

Home Charging problem after updating to 2025.14.30
Just did the update last night to version 2025.14.30 and started charging at home (Tesla level 2 charger) after the update completed. The charging was unusually slow and then just stopped altogether. The problem continues today. I’ve never had a problem before. And I’m using the Lectron adapter fyi. Anyone else? 

UPDATE
I’m now at a ChargePoint charging station near my house and while it is technically charging, it’s taking an eternity. To go from 40% to my usual 85% it says it’s gonna take about 19 hours - something that would usually take 6-7 hours on my home charger. Weird, no? 

Also, I did do a full reboot of the car this morning when I noticed that the problem persisted after doing the software update last night. "

Gen 1 R1S Launch to Gen2 R1S California Dune Impressions
- The cameras are unbelievable… better than any I’ve seen in any vehicle. You could film a feature film w/ these

- Max pack yields an extra ~30 miles of range which/ the All Terrains, I’m going an extra day or two without charging

- Car feels heavier. I know the speed specs are the same, but it feels tougher to get speed/less responsive

- New headlights are superb. They light up every part of the road you need to see and the dynamic movement works perfectly 

- The ride feels smoother, less road noise, build quality on the interior feels better put together

- LOVE the feeling of closing the doors, feels way better and sounds way better than Gen 1 (sounds like a G Wagen)

- The passenger side rear door still takes a hefty shove to close properly (I had the EXACT same problem/quirk w/ my Gen 1)

- I hated that they replaced the interior metal door handles with a plastic button, but after living with it for a few weeks, pushing the button actually fully releases the door… this is kind of nice, especially when I have things to bring inside like my wife’s giant Stanley cup

- The dynamic roof is a nice addition. I have a 14-month old and on sunny days the sun would beam into his face and bother him

- The body colored wheels look incredible, it’s my favorite part of the whole car… BUT they get super dirty easily and require quite a bit of cleaning maintenance 

- The two-tone interior is beautiful. I love the Sandstone color and prefer it to the Ocean Coast I had. 

- The LED lights that show how much the car is charged underneath both the front and rear light bars is a nice addition (I get it’s not a big deal, but it looks cool and actually serves as a nice visual cue)

- The flooring is incredible. Every car should get rid of carpet and implement this flooring. I haven’t even taken out the mats to replace them w/ my all-weather mats yet… flooring + Chilewich mats are excellent 

- Insane to me that I was a early pre-order and Launch Edition owner and went straight into a special edition Rivian and got nothing from the company… no merch, no shop cash, had to even buy a new camp speaker (wouldn’t let me keep mine from the Launch Edition trade-in), no NACS adapter after I told them mine got stuck on a Tesla charger. Absolutely nothing to reward my loyalty. Keep in mind the special editions like California Dune aren’t eligible for any of the promos either… I am disappointed by that to say the least"

Just replaced my R1S windshield in Safelite today (with OEM glass)
Hi, just want to share a data point and hope that this will be helpful for some of the Rivian people here. I decided to do it at Safelite because they offered a good price and can do it right away (while the earliest SC appointment is like 2 month away).

**Location**: Bay Area, CA

**Cost**: on the Safelite website it quoted around $700 (with an online coupon) and you can placed an order there to secure the price. When I was dropping off I was told that the price was for aftermarket glass and they had to do OEM glass for Rivian for some reason (not super clear why, sounds like something to do with the calibration requirements) but will honor my online price. The regular Safelite price with the OEM glass seems to be around $1000 because they originally charged that amount to my credit card but promised will update it. To give more context, the San Jose service center has quoted me \~$1800 in total, but will charge me $80 for calibration only (will do a separate appointment with the SC later).

**Quality:** I may be just unlucky but I immediately found the foggy rain sensor when picking up. The technician took the car back to the shop and re-did it in like 10\~20 minutes. After that the frunk also refused to automatically close after being opened (alerting that it is blocked by some object). The technician opened up the frunk cover again but didn't find anything wrong, and the problem just suddenly disappeared. Everything else looks fine though after these two problems were resolved. I did see the Rivian logo on the new glass, the whole thing looks exactly the same as my old glass.

**Other notes**: the front desk mentioned that this car is too new so they can't do calibration themselves, implying that they may start doing calibration service for Rivian cars at some point down the road.

  
\[Update\]: I just finished the calibration in SC. I used the Driver+ to drive to the SC (about 20mi) and I didn't feel any difference. I ended up being charged $80 for the calibration, but I was told that if Safelite ever messed up the rain sensor I will need to have it replaced (which will add another $200 on the top) and it sounds like it is not a small chance that it may happen."

One month - 1250 miles - short review
I've had my 2025 R1T DM Max for a bit over a month and driven it 1250 miles.  The only problem that I've experienced was with the PAAK but that seems to have been resolved after the latest update.  

The ongoing learning process continues.  I've yet to take a real road trip but I am trying to 'internalize' the impact of speed on range for trips of 200 mile plus so I can better anticipate charging needs.  I have my home charger installed (Grizzl-E Ultimate 48) and I love that convenience. I have an A2Z NACS to CCS1 adapter but have yet to use it.  I want to try charging at a local Tesla Supercharger soon - before I need to do it on a road trip.

I love the truck but here are three minor (some would say nitpicky) things that I miss.

1) Satellite radio.  I live in a rural area so spots of lousy cell service are not uncommon.  Sometimes my R1T loses the connection while siting in my car port.  And sometimes the Sirius connection won't renew until I park the truck and wake it up again.

2) Related to #1.  I've kept a USB thumb drive plugged into previous trucks so I could play my stored music when reception was bad or I was just bored with the choices.  Sure, I know I can play music from my phone over Bluetooth but that also involves starting an app on my phone.  Not as easy as selecting a static device from the entertainment center.

3) I'm probably way in the minority on this but as an everyday driver of pickup trucks for the past 25 years I miss my rear slider.  I won't miss it when the temperature is 90+ or when it snowing but it sure was nice in the spring & fall! ;-)

Applause for Las Vegas Service
 I read a lot of posts about people who’ve had unhappy experiences with service, so here’s a post sharing a happy one. My R1S had a sensor issue that wasn’t able to be fixed with mobile service so I had to drive it 2.5 hours to the Las Vegas center. They were able to give me an appointment on the day I requested, I dropped it off early, they took it in right on time and communicated with me either by message or phone call every day. It took four days to diagnose (wiring harness gone awry) and repair my problem (along with another minor issue). When all was said and done, they even washed it and gave it a little charge before I got there to pick it up. The whole experience was pleasant and easy. The most inconvenient part was the distance to the service center and I can’t wait for the company to grow enough to build more centers. "

Service Center Praise & 2025.10 Bug
Had a problem this morning and my air suspension, collision warning was disabled, and had electrical warning.  Air suspension was totally off- wouldn't work at all.  Did soft and hard resets- nothing worked. Called Rivian and they immediately got me into newly opened Rivian Service Center in Glen Burnie, Maryland.

The team there was exceptional and my car was on a lift being inspected within five minutes of me driving up to the place.  Can't say enough good things about how fast and communicative they were about inspecting everything with the car.

The great news is that there was nothing mechanically wrong with the R1S (I have a Gen2).  The bad news is that there is a known software bug in 2025.10 that sometimes causes these air suspension issues between ride settings and kneeling.  

I was told that Rivian HQ is aware and a patch is coming.  I was also told that allowing the car to do a sleep cycle should rectify the problem.  

Overall- shout out to the people at Glen Burnie.  Went over every inch of my car and ran diagnostics and checked hardware anyway - just to be sure, washed and charged it, and were super nice.  And keep an eye out for this 2025.10 bug."

Wtf 2025.10.01, extremely buggy
First off, I love my Rivian despite all the v1 small problems, and the truck being in the service center 10+ times. 

This newest update has got to be the buggiest software release ever. Phantom drain is through the roof, I lose so much power each 24/hr cycle. 

The worst of all is me being on a roadtrip where the screens are constantly freezing while I am driving. They will reboot on their own, but then freeze and reboot again. When I finally needed to charge, the car would not connect to the chargers (Ea). I tried 5 stalls (there were 14), so being that it was EA I assumed it was an EA issue, went down the street to a Tesla, same thing. Did a soft reboot, didn't fix it, did a hard reboot, then I could charge. 

After that hard reboot, as I continued my trip, screens were freezing and rebooting on its own again, not as often though. 

This whole thing was annoying and frustrating. Most of all, I had a truck full of Tesla owners and a gas car owner. A you may expect, the diss, the shit talk and the undesiredness to ever go with a Rivian was at a peak. The gas car owner was in their first EV road trip and said they would never get an EV because of what they experienced. 

I have a 22 r1t, and this was its time to shine, and it missed its opportunity. "

What are the biggest improvements Rivian can make for the R2?
Reading various online forums, reddit, etc, I see the following issues with current videos

1. **Service**  \- Hands down the biggest issue, and more service centers is only part of the problem.  Seems like people have to wait too long for parts, there is no effective triage system, as cars sit for weeks to be even diagnosed, etc.  
2. **Heat Pump -** seems like it ranges from annoying to outright broken, as the [recent reddit post describes](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1k0ihyo/gen2_hvac_heatpump_vibration_update/) 
3. **Charging** \- Mostly from Out of Spec on YT, it seems like the charge curve ranges from barely acceptable to outright disastrous, especially when you consider the Hyundai/Kia and the like can go from 20-80% in under 20 minutes.
4. **12V Issues -**  It seems the car needs a tow in the event of a 12V failure, which many many people experience.  This occurs with little to no warning.   

Rivian has an incredible opportunity with the R2, but they have to get it right.    If they sell 10x the number of cars, and have the same level of issues, with the same quality of service, it's going to be a disaster, and possibly unrecoverable.

  
What do others think?

Buying from CarMax but charging cable and one key missing
I paid a couple hundred bucks to ship a 2022 R1T to my local CarMax. I don't live near a service center and it was the best way I could test one.

It came in yesterday. I test drove it this morning. I love it. I'm going to buy it.

Minor issues:

1) Only one of the credit card-like keys came with it. I assume that's not a problem, but should I try to replace it to have an extra? I assume y'all carry one around to have a backup in case the app isn't working? (No key fob either, but maybe that's not unusual.)

2) A little more surprising--there is no charging cable. The air compressor hose, flashlight, and Bluetooth speaker are there, but no way to charge it at home. CarMax said they'd pay (or reimburse me) up to $250 for one. The $400 Rivian cable on the store shows none available. Any suggestions on what I should get from Amazon or some other place?

If you have any other tips or things I should look out for, please let me know. I'm buying it anyway, but still."

Questions from a newbie about phone pairing behavior
These issues may all be related or not. I took delivery of the car in early February this year and have had no problems with it.

1. I loved the proximity unlock feature when I first got the car, but soon realized it was a problem since my office and garage are close and the car was constantly locking and unlocking all day long, so I turned it off. NBD, I don't mind manually unlocking.

2. I noticed that if the phone were in my office and near the garage wall, the truck would still unlock itself and then relock. Weird since I turned it off.

3. Yesterday, my wife was taking a call about 70 ft from the truck, and the call transferred to the car. She quickly disconnected, but the vehicle remained on, with its screens still on, as well as the heat pump fans, etc.

4. Later, I plugged the car in for a short charge and left for a couple of hours. When I came back, the fans were running, the screens were on, and the car was locked.

5. This morning, my Emporia Charger started at 7.00 am per my schedule. I wasn't sure why it needed to, since the car was at charge limit, but when I checked on the vehicle, it was once again on with screens, heat pumped, etc.

I am troubled by this, since the car was at 70% last night and 67% this morning. I think it came on overnight and burned kWs for no reason.

I would be grateful if anyone had any insights. I have tried anything at this point.

[Solved] Rivian Portable Charger Pulsing Red
TLDR; Fixed by Proper Grounding in Subpanel

This fixed a problem I had charging in one of my locations. If you are comfortable doing a bit of electrical work, it is an easy fix. Also it is likely pretty obvious to any electrician, but I am more of a hobbiest. 
Sharing in case it helps anyone else. 

I installed a Rivian portable charger on a dedicated 50A subpanel and ran into an issue where the charger would just pulse red and refuse to charge.

Initial Setup:
6/3 NM-B wire (black, red, white, bare copper ground)
50A Square D breaker
NEMA 14-50 outlet
Wired hot-hot-neutral-ground
Subpanel fed from my main panel (with isolated ground/neutral)

Problem:
The charger pulsed red constantly and wouldn't begin charging. I had removed the white (neutral) wire from both ends based on Rivian's spec (they don't use neutral), but the issue persisted.

Root Cause:
The ground wire was present in the conduit but was not connected inside the subpanel. It was cut off and never landed on the ground bar. So the charger was detecting a missing ground path and refusing to operate for safety reasons.

Fix:
Connected the bare copper ground wire to the subpanel’s ground bus (which is isolated from neutral, as it should be in a subpanel).

Left the white neutral wire completely disconnected and capped.

Confirmed proper hot-hot (~240V) and hot-ground (~120V) voltages.

After restoring the ground connection, the charger immediately turned solid green and began charging.

---

Rivian portable charger needs only 240V (hot-hot-ground) — no neutral.

In a subpanel, ground and neutral must be separate.

No connected ground = charger will pulse red and not work.

Always double check both ends of your grounding path if you see that pulsing red fault.

Hope this saves someone else a few hours of head-scratching! "

finally got my R1T pulling right fixed by Rivian!
about 1 year ago i bought used 2022 R1T quad LE

everything was in good condition except car was pulling right

  
i contacted Rivian, they told me it must be out of alignment, i kind of agreed, i paid $260 to get it aligned from Rivian

Initially it was better, but eventually it started pulling right, got another service appointment and got the alignment again for FREE

however problem came back, got alignment again for FREE

  
but still problem not fixed, on the forth visit, they admitted suspension and steering wheel is off the center, so they fixed it and it is not pulling right anymore

  
that is cool, but on the way back from i noticed steering wheel shaking a lot, got the appointment again, technician test drove with me on highway and admitted it is a lot of feedback, he told me it could be wheel balance, however i got the wheel balanced less than 200miles ago

  
he told me if this is balance issue the service will be charged, i said okay

They had my car for about 3\~4 days and replaced steering wheel? and i didn't get charged, and i confirmed there is no more steering wheel shaking on highway speed

  
everything is fixed now, so happy with the vehicle finally after 1 year of ownership"

Road trip return
Renter an Airbnb in New Orleans with fellow Rivian friends. It's kind of a charging desert with incompatible super chargers, bunch of level two options and wildly expensive 62.5 Kw/h ChargePoints at car dealerships. Street parking and no ability to charge at home. 

I wouldn't get an EV if I lived here unless I had an unusual driveway/garage. Didn't really matter though as visitors as there are decent options on the way in or out. I wouldn't come coasting in at 10% and hope to top off overnight though. 

No real Rivian presence here - lots of questions from folks. Few EVs at all actually which given the setup makes sense. 

Our friends were paranoid about having a nice car in the ""rough"" city but the problem that happened was a rock chip in their windshield while driving out to the swamps. You can't win. "

Charging Problems or Normal?
Found a 2023 R1S with 36,000 miles that was traded in at a Chevrolet dealership within an hours drive. Went and looked at it, loved it, signed the paperwork and brought it home this afternoon.

During the test drive, the vehicle was around 31% charge with an estimated 98 mile range. While finishing up the paperwork, the dealership put it on their fast charger (according to the Rivian app, its a 50kw max DC charger). When the salesman unplugged the charger, it has been charging for 25 minutes, and was up to 43% with 128 mile range.

When I got home, I had 65 mile range remaining. I plugged the Rivian in with the 110v charger in my garage and the display says its charging a 0 mi/hr. It's now been plugged in for 1h45m and the range is now 67 miles. 

I had originally read to expect up to 5 mi/hr when charging on a 110v charger, so I guess I was expecting 2-3 mi/hr. But it looks like I'm getting 0.5.

Is this normal or does this vehicle have a charging problem?"

My Purchase Experience (spoiler alert - no complaints!)
I've been lurking on this sub while I was getting to my own 'purchase point'.  In that time I've seen a lot of questions, comments and anecdotes posted about the purchase process.  I thought that a more comprehensive look might benefit some people who are still on the fence.

This will be somewhat long so:

TLDR version: Purchase process was fine. Love the truck. 

Two comments to start.  

1) There really is no way to claim that spending $100K on a truck makes sense, but replacing my Ram Limited would probably cost $80K.  Can't defend that either.  But I'm retired & lucky enough to be able to afford it.

2) Driving/owning this truck does require some adjustments.  I think of it as buying a truck built by a technology company vs. buying a truck built by a truck company (that includes technology built by a truck company).  I've been involved with technology much of my life so it makes sense to me.

I live 60 miles from the 'mother ship' in Normal so I've been following Rivian since they purchased the old Mitsubishi plant.  Then when Gen 2 arrived I knew I was ready to make my move.

Here is some of the reasoning behind my configuration choices - leaving out cosmetic choices.

Dual Motor - I looked at the performance stats.  600 hp & 0-6 in 3.4 seconds? That should be enough. Also, (see below) range was a consideration.

Max Battery - I live in a rural area and 2-4 times per month I drive a 200 mile round trip.  Even with cold weather impact on range I should be able to do that 200 miles without charging.

All Terrain Pkg - Again - rural area = rural roads. Snow, mud from farm equipment, pot holes.  The AT tires seem better equipped to handle that.

 Performance Upgrade - what's another $5K at this point?

I actually did a 2nd demo drive to see the new powered tonneau cover and the dynamic glass roof.  I had decided not to get the 1st generation tonneau but the new one seemed much smoother.  Also decided that I was ambivalent about the dynamic glass.

Adding the Sound & Vision package pushed the estimated delivery from 2-6 weeks to 8-12 weeks so I left it off.

I put my deposit down on MAR 11. That afternoon I got a text from a Rivian guide asking me if Friday would work for delivery?  What?  THIS Friday?  We settled on Tuesday, March 25 and I worked through the purchase process online.  Upload DL. Upload insurance card. 

I had previously worked through their trade-in application and wasn't happy with the amount they offered for my 2016 Ram Limited EcoDiesel.  When I noticed that I wasn't getting the $4500 All-Electric Upgrade Credit I asked the guide to look at that and was immediately given the credit.

I decided to lease first with the intent to buy-out the lease sometime during the next 36 months.  As is normal with Reddit you will find commenters who absolutely agree with this and those who absolutely disagree.  Ultimately I decided to lease first because 1) Rivian would apply the $7500 credit to the lease amount; 2) I could keep my diesel pickup for a few months while I get comfortable using the R1T to pull my trailer; and 3) if I had serious problems the truck belongs to Chase.

The next day (MAR 12) I unfroze my credit reporting accounts and completed the finance application.  Apparently the credit reporting companies don't unlock immediately because on MAR 13 Chase twice told me they couldn't process my application because my credit was locked.  Eventually it was approved.

I assumed that the actual leasing contract would follow at this rapid pace.  Wrong.  The leasing contract is only sent out about 48 hours before the scheduled delivery.  I received the email from Chase to sign the contract on SAT MAR 22.  Note that the amount due at signing on the lease agreement did not reflect my deposit but the ACH transaction at Rivian did.  I signed the lease contract, completed the ACH payment at Rivian, and received confirmation that everything was ready for the scheduled MAR 25 delivery.  I then received a follow-up confirmation about the scheduled delivery on Monday, MAR 24.

The delivery process was painless.  Parked at the factory reception area and registered, was driven back to the delivery area (which is behind the factory why??) and spent probably 30-40 minutes poking & prodding my new truck.  Signed the registration paperwork and drove it home!

I've spent a fair amount of time the past two days ""playing"" with my new truck and have yet to find anything on the truck that isn't working perfectly.  Maybe I'll post again after I've had it 90 days.

Precondition Battery & Cab from Grid power
Hi, new R1T owner switching from Tesla in the north east. 
Tesla has a fantastic software stack and one feature that I was missing is the ability to on-demand warm up the cab and heat the battery for optimal range and regen braking in cold weather.

The following may be common knowledge to experienced owners, but it might help other new owners.

Problem: heating the cab from the app while plugged in doesn't pull from the grid.

Solution: use scheduled departure.

Steps: Rivian App > Climate details > Scroll down, Tap Schedule pencil > Tap ""+"" > Pick your options, scroll down, slide on ""Pull from charger to maintain range"" > Save

Note: if the vehicle state of charge is greater than or equal to the current max state of charge, it won't pull from grid when conditioning the cab.  To fix this, simply adjust the max state of charge to greater than the current state of charge. 

I don't know what happens at 100% state of charge.  
I'm driving an R1T with a LFP pack.

It's not as convenient as Tesla's ""smart pre condition"", but glad to have an option and I think Rivian can close this gap with a software update.  

Really enjoying the R1T!"

Good Deal? 2023 Quad R1T $60k
Hey guys, 

I’ve been eying a Rivian R1T since release. Went with a Tesla M3P in 2022 due to cost, but looking to finally try and snag one.

Paid an arm and a leg for the Model 3 and Drive ~25k miles a year. Good news is I am reimbursed for milage so it will be a wash. Charging is a non issue and just looking for something with more space. 

Found my ideal build—2023 Forest Green R1T Quad with the green interior. Under 20k miles. $60k.

Not as familiar with the options but looks like no Tonneau cover, however it does have the speaker included, tow package, and moon-roof. 

No issues other than it being marked a fleet vehicle. Doesn’t bother me as my M3P is as well and near mint minus the Milage. 

Curious what you guys think. Would like a model with a little more range but know I’d be stepping into six figure cost for that most likely.  Any problem with the quad-motor vs new dual? 

Thanks in advance!"

Delivery Review and First Impression
Hi All,

  
Just picked up my R1S Dual Max with Performance Upgrade on monday from SSF Service Center and would like to share my experience. 

https://preview.redd.it/ax5fqg30eope1.png?width=968&format=png&auto=webp&s=cdb1082f5a6f2a4d34f51e1851e76c042973a13e

  


The Good

They were kind enough to have my car ready a day early, my initial pick up date was on march 18th, and was able to pick up on the 17th

I brought my son with me and well he didn't take it quite well that we are trading my old car (Refresh 23 Model X) and was crying during the process. Our travel guide was kind to give him couple of rivian Ts lol. 

The process was quick - signed paper work, quick intro with the car and we were on our way. This was way more i got when i got the Model X

We did have to delay the car pick up for an hour - it was an unfortunate timing since i didn't get the call or text while i was walking in. This was due to the latest update. 

  
The Bad

The driver seat and handle handle had paint residue and need to be replaced. I made an appt and it will be in June. Theres other white specks in the interior and they do stand out since my interior is black

https://preview.redd.it/lalt27rudope1.png?width=1124&format=png&auto=webp&s=414a9454909089c3cce5aa8368831c95ae7d036e

First Impression

Build Quality seems better than the Model X. I dont hear any squeaks when driving. 

The wind noise is definitely a lot more noticeable. I can hear the outside wind when driving in the freeway - this can be mitigated by turning up the music a tad bit louder. I wasn't really hearing any wind noise from the Model X - but this is probably due to the Active Noice Cancelling Feature that they have

This vehicle is huge and small inside at the same time if that make sense. we came from a 6 seater to 7 seats and while we will never use the back row - having to fold the middle row to get to the back is an adjustment

The doors a little vent here, is it a normal experience to almost close the door hard? not slamming it hard but closing it with a purpose? First world problem i know - but i had to never close the door in the model x, the door open itself, and close once i press the break (driver) and i can push  buttons to open and close the doors the rest of the car. i have 2 kids less than 6 and my god not having the full back door fully open is pain. i had to park between 2 cars and jesus i had to squeeze them in to get to the car seat. 

Driving is ok - i have to get used to it and there will be an adjustment (from yolk steering wheel and no actual stalk to round steering wheel). The alignment feels off - as soon as i let go of the steering wheel it veers to the right. 

Now this is just me but i took the car for an errand yesterday (80 miles round trip) but i feel nauseous after getting out the car both ways; this could be the new car smell or just getting used to the driving the car itself, the regen is pretty strong - i have it set to moderate and probably need to lower it.  

The OS is ok to good - i like it to be honest. sure it doesn't have that full entertainment stuff like tesla but i have never have to use it. 

i have a road trip coming up and excited to see what the car can do and the charging experience will look like. 

  
let me know if you have further questions!

2025.06.30 update
Anybody else having issues since this last update? It’s been f’ing terrible to put it lightly. Features worked great but as soon as I installed the update:
1) phone as key stopped working
2) driver side phone charger stopped working
3) when I place my phone on the charger it opens up Apple pay 
Wish I could roll back the update. 

-EDIT

For 2 and 3 it looks like not having the card key near the charging pad resolved both issues. Kinda funny, it’s like blowing in the Nintendo cartridge before plugging it in: it works but I don’t know why.

A different problem popped up. My wing mirrors auto unfolding only happens haphazardly. Same with lights turning on at entry. "

Charging R1S with Tesla Wall Charger - Overheating?
I searched but couldn’t find anything on this. I have a Model 3 and just bought a Rivian R1S Gen 1. I thought my existing Tesla wall charger would work (with a Lectron adapter). It will charge at the full rate for a hour or so but then the Tesla charger flashes that it’s overheating and drops to 4.4KWh. I have no problems with it on my Tesla. Thoughts on what I need to do?"

Disappointed in Rivian’s pre-purchase customer service.
Since I’m new to EVs and buying a car online I have been trying to get questions answered, dot my “I”s and cross my “T”s before making my final decision. Seems understandable considering the investment. I keep having to wait days to get questions answered that should be easy and same day. And a couple of the people representatives at the 800 number have given me wrong information. For example they told me to enter the EV upgrade discount into the down payment field. Found out that was wrong. Another person told me that the Dual Standards have the Vision and Sound package, “just keep looking on the website” even though it’s not an option when building a Dual Standard. I am hearing different information on GAP insurance. Some people have said it’s included in the lease but the sales person says it’s extra with their insurance company. Again, I have been waiting for someone to contact me but no one does.
I learned here on Reddit that charging slows down on all of the batteries so 80% is the common charging point on road trips. This has made me want to consider the Max battery upgrade again. Since there isn’t a field in the calculator to work in the 3k EV upgrade discount so I can compare the difference in price, I emailed the salesperson I did the test drive with but he didn’t respond to my email. So yesterday I reached out to Rivian and the persons said a sales person would contact me. No one got back to me yesterday. In order to take advantage of the current offers you have to take possession by March 31 yet they delay the buying process. It’s so frustrating. It’s making concerned for the actually owning/leasing customer service. At this point I want to work with a different sales person. I wish I could just call the Venice location but there isn’t a local number. I’m beginning to think Rivian might not be reliable if problems arise. "

Worst Day 1 Delivery Experience Ever at Rivian Costa Mesa: R1S sadness
**TLDR; I took possession of a new R1S with significant defects and problems that should have been addressed prior to delivery.**

I've owned a dozen cars over the years, and want to share the delivery experience I've had with Rivian. It's by far the worst one in terms of prep and followup.

Before I get into the weeds, I want to disclose that I love Rivian, have wanted an R1S for ages, and have been excited that my time finally could come. My friends have an R1S. It's awesome.

Through the assistant manager at Rivian in Laguna Beach I was able to find a car that I liked, though based on the S/N it seemed to have been sitting for a while in Salt Lake, and I had to haggle to get credits to offset the delivery charge. I figured they would prep the car like any other.

I arrived on Monday in Costa Mesa and discovered that the tailgate had some faint scratches on the paint, where the lower panel meets the upper one. The field guide agreed that they would do a thorough detail the following week so I drove off thinking that all was well.

Big Mistake! I should have kept the car there.

Taking the time to do a thorough check of the car, I noticed (1) that there were scratches in the rear light bar panels on the tailgate, the ""N"" on the Rivian logo, and that the lower gate was out of alignment, that (2) most of the door handles squeaked when activated, that (3) the frunk squeaked when activated, that (4) there was a hard rattle in the driver's door when closed, that (5) there was a piece sticking out of the underbody, and (6) that there were signs of dirt in the roof top mounting points, as well as some fine scratches in the rooftop black paint panel.

Basically, they didn't thoroughly prep and inspect the car prior to delivery.

On Day 3, I turned in the car and they agreed to address all of the problem and offered on Day 5 a complimentary set of crossbars. I appreciate that a lot. I was told the car would ""hopefully"" be ready on Day 8. I currently am driving a Gen1 R1S from Enterprise.

  
However it is now the end of Day 8, and I've heard nothing from the lead Service Advisor. I reached out to the assistant manager at Rivian in Laguna Beach late last night and have not heard back. I'm expecting that I will.

I'm sure that all of this will be addressed eventually, but I also think that as a premium auto maker, these problems should be avoidable. I also believe I probably should have insisted on a car that had not been sitting on the lot for so long, even if the price was favorable due to the promotions in place. Yet, other automakers have not let us down in that area."

Charging & Heating Problems?
I’ve had my Rivian R1S Gen 2 for about two weeks, and I’m starting to feel like something might be wrong.

First, I noticed that the heating isn't working. The fans are blowing, but no heat comes out. That definitely needs to be fixed, but then I ran into another issue with charging.

When I went for my first fast charge at an EVgo station, my car only pulled around **20-30 kW**, even though the charger is rated for **100 kW**. Another R1S owner pulled up, and I asked her to try the same charger. She got **around 70 kW**, but her battery was at **81%**, while mine was at **70%**.

One difference: I have the **Standard battery**, and she had the **Long Range**.

Should I expect this lower charge rate with the Standard battery, or does it sound like something is wrong? Not worried about the heating, that’s clearly an issue, but the charging speed seems off.

Anyone else experience this?"

Mobile service checked and replaced my 12V.
So I’ve been meaning to have the service center check the health of the 12V battery on my 2022 R1S. So I used the app to schedule an apt. I was pleasantly surprised for the following reasons:

1. The scheduling “bot” understood what I was trying to do and immediately offered mobile service. 

2. Plenty of apt times available with less than a week of wait. 

3. Mobile service came, opened up the battery casing, used a battery gauge and determined that one of them was near depletion. Replaced both with new ones she brought with her. 

4. She also replaced the seals on the portable charger (guess charging pin corrosion has been an issue with some owners so they’re running a service campaign). 

5. She also did a courtesy tire inspection/inflation. 

6. All of this cost me nothing. 

Mind you I had no symptoms of a bad 12V or anything like that. I just wanted to check that it’s fine for a piece of mind and am so glad I did. I ended up with brand new batteries and didn’t have to leave the house. 

I guess Rivian is trying to get ahead of the problem as well. I highly recommend this service. 

I’m in SoCal and my SC is in Costa Mesa. "

Thinking about minivan to R1S
Hey there. Currently own an older Model S and a Honda Odyssey. We’re thinking of trading in the Ody for a 2023 R1S. 

Did a test drive of a Gen2, have done a ton of research, but was just wondering “real-world” if this is a logical step. 

We do take the Odyssey on long (~2400 mile round trip) excursions, but those are few and far between. I’m more concerned about something like a ~300 mile trip (one way) to get my kids to college with their stuff in the cold (NY). We’ve taken relatively long trips in the Model S and the software has been exceptional at getting us to the next supercharger, indicating availability, and telling us how long it will take. Is the Rivian experience (charging multiple times over longer trips) reliable and accurate? Obviously one of Tesla’s big advantages is the charging network but with Rivian being able to access it, are the routing and recharging options similar? The folks at the Rivian showroom said “no problem”, I’d love a slightly less biased take.

Sorry if this has already been discussed, I couldn’t find it. I know the X and Y are options, but there are many reasons I’m much more interested in the R1S. Thanks!"

Considering a move to Rivian, but currently charge off a 120v
Back in 2016 I bought a Model X 75D new, and it has been the best car I've ever had. We're family of four, living in NYC, but drive regularly on the weekends and do a couple road trips a year up and down the East Coast (usually North up to ME). We're low milage because none of us need to drive to commute, and usually rely on the subway for in-city travel.

That said, the tech has come a long way since we went EV in 2016, and I'm not a fan of the direction Tesla has been going (Elon, the lack of physical controls). I love the look of the Rivian, and put down an R2 reservation. But I'm wondering about the R1S, because we really do use the full space of the Model X on a regular basis.

My X is old enough that I have only the most primitive self driving (AP1, so really just lane aware cruise control with the ability to auto park). It's the old platform X, so the ride can be a little harsh (I hear the later models improved with more advanced suspension). 

My biggest worries about switching to an R1S are:

1. Navigating it through the city. On paper it's the about the same length and width of the X, though taller. How have others in urban environments found maneuvering the R1S? My wife quite petite, is she going to have a solid seating position in the R1 that won't feel like climbing into a monster truck?
2. Charging off a 120v. I have a garage spot that I pay dearly for, but I can only charge off a standard 120v. Because of limited weekday driving this hasn't been an issue (been doing it for over 8 years now). I keep the car at 70% (\~160 miles on the 75D), it charges at about 3-4mph. If I know I'm doing a longer trip over the weekend I charge it up, and hit super chargers along the way (yay for free lifetime supercharging). I'm guessing the R1S would get about +2mph on a 120v, so I could get maybe 20 miles overnight or 48 miles a day? Now that Rivians have more general SC access I'm thinking the road trips would be fairly easy?
3. Service issues. Tesla was great when I had issues with my X. I'm worried about the ability to get service on the Rivian, or getting bricked on the road (I know people post more about problems than ""everything was fine today"", but it is worrisome) 

Any insight from those who've had similar concerns and made the jump?"

Service Center Blues
Posting this in case anyone from Rivian read this.  Mostly just venting as I love my R1T but please Rivian figure out service before you attempt to expand to the r2.  The current state is simply unacceptable on its face and will be a nightmare at higher volumes.

I posted last month about intermittent heating issues and ended up making a service center appointment in Boston which was just over a month out.  A few other small things cropped up (charge door not working from manual button, tire rotation, some voluntary recall that isn't a recall) so I just waited it out and brought my car to the SC on time.

I'm informed that they once again don't have a tech assigned yet and they'll set me up with a rental car.  This is already infuriating because Rivian YOU ARE MAKING THE APPOINTMENT AND TELLING ME WHEN TO COME IN.  If you're not going to be able to work on my car when I bring it in, then let me keep driving my car and tell me when you'll actually be able to get it. At the very least, do away with the nonsense of giving me a specific appointment time so I don't have to take time off work and drive through morning rush hour traffic to get my car to you at a specific time when you've got no intention of touching the car for a while. 

My car has now been at the SC for a full week. Today, I get a message informing me that there still is no tech assigned and that it has been 5 business days and typical wait times are 7-12 days.  This is valuable information that I would have loved to know 7 days ago when I dropped the car off and instead it's being dropped to me a week in where I apparently have at least 2 more days if not another full week until they start looking at it, then who knows how long from there.

In the end, I probably come across as more angry than I am.  At least they do give me a rental car, albeit a really lousy to drive Hyundai which is awful in the snow.  I'm mostly just baffled that this is how they seem to intend to do business.  It is, of course, a gigantic waste of money to be paying for long duration rental cars when my car was perfectly drivable.  But more than anything this is an 80-100k USD vehicle you can't be so poor in how you treat customers. If they get r2 rolling and these SCs continue to perform like this it'll take months to get an appointment and then months more for them to start working on the cars.  It's a massive problem that they're really not even talking about"

Anybody else had their R1-T/S charge port door spin itself off the vehicle?
Had a weird problem with my '22 R1-T this afternoon. The charger was plugged in for about 20 hours during some snowy, icy, and very cold weather. Removed the charger this afternoon and pressed the exterior ""close charger door"" button. The door partly closed, seemed to get caught on some snow/ice and moved back to open position. I tried to clear out the snow/ice/etc and hit the close button again. 

Then the weird part started. The motor kept spinning and the door extended out about 4"" before it fell out of the truck. The charger door came completely out of the truck (pictures attached). It doesn't seem obviously broken in any way but I couldn't figure out a way to get it to rewind back into the truck.

Has anybody else seen this? If so, any luck getting it to rewind back into the truck? I'm planning to call the Rivian Service Center tomorrow but I was wondering if anybody else had fixed this themselves before doing so.  If there's a simple fix I'd love to do that than mess around with a service call.

Thanks in advance for any advice.

Garage outlets not working after plugging in R1T
https://preview.redd.it/owu1ojyjz2ee1.jpg?width=3024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d05a63d734a22fe8dfe2b1be2e516342535b3100

I need help with an electrical problem I'm having at my house.

I plugged my new-to-me R1T into a 120v household outlet in my garage using the included mobile charger. It charged for less than a minute and then stopped because of an error. I assume the EV tried to pull too many amps but the error wasn’t very specific.

Now all 3 of the receptacles in my garage aren't working and oddly neither are the two receptacles in my two upstairs bathrooms. I checked and no breakers were tripped in my electrical panel.

All of the outlets in my garage including the one I plugged the EV into have stickers on them saying that they’re a GFCI outlet, but none have the reset or test buttons.

So I’ve spent the last two nights inspecting my house trying to find and reset every GFCI outlet but still haven’t been able to get any of the 5 receptacles to start working.

Any ideas what I can do to fix this? My house was built in 1993 if that helps."

Ongoing Gen2 Issues
I have both a Gen1 Quad and Gen2 dual motor, and have qualitatively noticed what seems to be two or three problems with Gen2 that are either very widespread and relatively minor or somewhat infrequent but major. I thought it may help some folks to see these documented in one place, and perhaps prompt a discussion.

1. Gen2 Center Console USBs do not work as advertised. The center console USB-C ports ""can support up to 60W from a single port, with a total maximum capacity of 67.5w for two ports.""

This has has been a problem with, as far as I can tell, zero variance between vehicles. It has been well documented by u/jrwagz here. Personally I find this issue fairly frustrating as it prevents me from using the USB ports to power multiple USB-C devices that I have, and if you happen to plug in a device that it doesn't like, that often kills the USB port until a reset. I understand that USB-C is not the most straightforward standard, but my R1 is literally the only charger that I have that cannot negotiate power with devices I have.

The vehicles have now been shipping to customers for more than 6 months without a software fix. It appears that Rivian selected a USB controller that is unable to perform as designed, and I suspect will require a hardware replacement to fix. Hopefully I'm wrong.

2. Max Pack Level 2 charging above 80%. I personally have not been subject to this issue, but many owners have documented derating something around 1kw above 80 or 90% SOC, resulting in issues with charging. There are threads and posts about this floating around in a few places, but this is the most thorough one. I hope that this is a software bug that will be fixed in the next release, but perhaps it's tied to a specific production range of vehicles for some reason. If a SC tells you that derating as documented like this is ""normal"" push back. It's not.

3. Least frequent, but most concerning is what appears to be drivetrain failures. Qualitatively there appears to have been a significant increase in the number of failures of enduro motors in the last four months or so.  I could be entirely wrong here, but I think it's worth at least discussing. Some examples just from Reddit.

edit: Just to be clear, the intent of this post is not to complain. Hopefully this post can become a bit of a central place on Reddit to, at least temporarily, track/document what seem to be issues that aren't just one-off experiences that people have to help owners, document when they've been resolved (if we find out), and make them more easily visible to Rivian. I hate doing this, but u/WassymRivian for some visibility as well at the recommendation of a commenter. "

Rivian = Awesome
I'm not one to typically write reviews good or bad, but I just got my Rivian R1S back from service. I had installed some sideboards and they ended up making some serious rattling sounds, but I thought it was coming from inside the car. Rivian said they'd have to take the sideboards off to figure out what was happening and then put them back on and that would cost $400 if indeed that was the issue. Understandable.

They had the car for three days, they worked their butts off on it \[I know cause the boards were really tough to handle and install\]. After all that effort from the service center, the car came back perfectly quiet and perfectly cleaned .....at no charge. 

Free service for problems I created isn't going to be the case every time of course, but just every once in a while to have a big manufacturer - *who has the right to stick it to you* \- to **not** stick it to you means the world.  I'm all in \[and btw - I was all in before because the product is awesome, now I'm even more so\]."

How do I force open the charge port door?
I’m in New Hampshire at a lodge with EV charging. Got here with 40 miles left. No problem I’ll charge overnight. Go to open the charge door and nothing but a click. It’s cold out and we just finished driving for 3.5 hours but not visibly frozen shut. Any help would be great I’d prefer to not just rip it off and do damage. "

Has anyone used this MagSafe charger?
I’m pretty frustrated with the wireless charging pad in my Gen2 R1T. Not only does my iPhone slide all over, it barely charges when I do keep it in place, and it makes my phone so hot it’s kind of worrying. 

Has anyone tried the TWRAPS Dual Wireless Phone Charger? Seems like it should solve all of those problems, but I’m not sure about the fit and finish. Any feedback would be helpful, thanks!"

After a year with an R1T, filled with regret.
We leased our R1T over a year ago, we did the lease because we had some doubts about the brand. In the first year of the lease, truck has constantly needed little fixes. Now it needs some major ones. The passenger side won’t recognize that there is someone there (no matter what the weight) and disables the airbag. It has a seal issue on the passenger side door and has really loud road noise on the freeway. Now most recently it won’t charge at the same speed on our home Tesla charger. We have had service visits. Most recently I called trying to get them to take the truck for a while to fix it. They gave me some date two months out. When I said that was unacceptable, they said they would come out next week. Hoping it gets fixed, but I am really not feeling the Rivian Brand. The truck is beautiful and WHEN working rides great. I am just really disappointed with all the problems. Not worth the price so far. Have other people had these issues pile up like this? Were they eventually resolved?"

Purchase Experience and Initial Thoughts on Audio


Long post - TLDR - Rivian team was awesome, most painless buying experience in my life even when there were hiccups.



My purchase was a bit complicated by my mother taking a fall in early December. What was expected to be an uncomplicated procedure ended up with a lot of complications and an extended stay including a discharge to our home for continued rehab on 12/29 (she's doing much better, washing our dishes, watering our plants and generally being forced to not go out and shovel our snow).  

When I first ordered I went with an available model (dual motor max sound and vision, compressor) etc..   Delivery was set for 12/31.    At the time all seemed good, my wife and I would head up to trade in her van, she'd take the Y and I'd be in charge of the new family mover.   

When things got complicated with my mom we realized that there wasn't an easy way to get to the delivery location together as we didn't want to leave her alone for 5 hours for the round trip, and that complicated things since this car was in my name and the trade was in my wife's.   Rivian didn't skip a beat, they were able to overnight docs for my wife to notarize, we snapped pics confirmed with their remarketing team that everything they needed was ready to go and then overnighted the docs back.  I was worried this might be a dealbreaker since trading in or selling a car you don't personally own is no bueno, and I was grateful they were able to come up with a solution.  I didn't push on this, knowing that it might just not be doable, so I was really happy here.  

Then, delivery slipped.   I got a call on the 28th that it looked like my vehicle wasn't going to be available in time.  It looked like the earliest might be 1/5.   Not a huge deal, but they wanted to see if they could find another I'd be happy with that was local.   I was taking advantage of the 2.99 year end financing.   None of the other duals had premium audio, so I invited them to check out tris.  There was a tri that fit the bill and I was up for putting a bit more into the car.   After we signed off on everything they realized that they could not honor the 2.99 and it would be 6.99 on the tris.  That, however, was a dealbreaker for me.\*   No problem, my original vin was still available and Rivian walked back the new purchase, resent the original purchase reflecting my additional down payment (covering the difference in the two vehicles to keep the loan the same), and we were scheduled for 1/5. 

I ended up going with Rivian for insurance, technically nationwide.  I have not aggressively shopped insurance in a few years, but the cost for the brand new rivian and my y was a \*heck\* of a lot lower than I was paying for a 15 year-old honda odyssey and my y with less coverage.  Added on home and ended up saving four figures in premiums.    This also led to another moment of great customer service.  I had the problem of having cancelled my insurance effective 12/31 with my prior carrier and now had a large van I'd be driving 2+ hours to trade that wasn't insured.  For almost no money and one email my rivian insurance rep added the van on for a week to solve the issue and sent over new cards.  

Then on 1/1 I got a marketing email from Rivian telling me about the q1 promotion of 1.99% on my model.  DOH!   Literally one semi-sheepish text later, I had a new finance agreement honoring the lower rate.   

From a sales experience all of this was a 10/10.   The team at Rivian solved for my unexpected circumstances making the trade in difficult, worked quickly to fix a modest delivery delay, fixed the resulting insurance hiccup and honored a lower interest rate on financing after we'd already signed off on the prior agreement.   Very few of these were things that they had to do and I can't guarantee that they'd do them for everyone, and frankly, even if one of these things didn't work out (for example, they couldn't honor the promotional financing on the tri, which was fine), it still would have been a fantastic experience with smart, communicative people, genuinely looking for a painless and enjoyable buying process.   

My only critique is having to drive over 2 hours to the nearest delivery location, but I could also have chosen to pay the 1k for a home-delivery if that was truly intolerable and Pennsylvania could also choose to let them sell vehicles in the state.   

I wanted to share this because sometimes people post when things go wrong especially in sales process issues, and after dealing with dealers for 25+ years, I think it's important to point out how different and frankly how much better this was than any dealer experience I've ever had.  

**Initial Thought on the Premium Audio as of 1/5**

I'm going to make this shorter and might post separately - 

1. The premium audio is very good in my R1S with the latest firmware.   It is not especially hyped and sounds a lot more like neutral studio monitors than the sound of most cars.   It's also not default tuned to favor the left front which is definitely the ""default"" in my model Y and a lot of other cars, and of course they are - we're the drivers, screw everyone else.   I found the sweet spot for me, not messing with the EQ but moving the fade and pan a bit off it's default center to sit just to the left like right on the right side of the driver's seat.  This takes a bit of the pressure off the large center speaker and makes it sound more like a traditional car audio system.  The second row drivers are also very good and they bring a lot of balance to the sound.  I was *really* scared I was going to refuse delivery over the sound, but it is at least on par with my model y, which is all I can ask.  It does stereo separation better and is particularly good at reproducing sibilance and high end in drums and instruments.   

  
Anyway really long post, mostly wanted to praise Rivian's team for a great sales process working together to resolve the few issues we had, mostly created by my own life circumstances.   Love love love the car.





\* Nobody needs a six figure car.  I think just about everyone on this thread who owns a rivian is in some version of very lucky to be in a position to entertain owning a luxury priced vehicle, even at the most base level lease, it is still more than a lot of people have available for rent.  Everyone of us could get by fine with a 20k or less beater that would get us to where we're going.   I love cars and technology and I fully acknowledge that owning a rivian and generally swapping cars with my wife every 3-4 years or so is an indulgence.  One of the reasons low interest is so important to me though is that cars are a t-e-r-r-i-b-l-e investment (says the guy who bought a Y in 2021 when they were over 60k).  So if I'm going to indulge, I want to keep as much of my money out of the car as possible, and make sure that the interest cost to do that is less than I can earn on the money elsewhere.  So around 3-3.5% on a car is usually my cut off.   I don't lease because I drive 18-20k miles a year and buying has generally let me hold some of the value in the car for when I go to get my next one.   Just my personal take on any of this. "

Great Lakes winter road trip summary
**TL;DR** Love the Rivian R1T, charging was better but more expensive than expected, efficiency slightly worse than expected, different bugs every day but no major issues, hopefully future updates will continue to make it better.

Between Christmas and New Year's we drove 1,350 miles (29 hours) in my 2025 Gen 2 DM R1T with 20"" ATs from Northern VA to Buffalo, Niagara Falls, Toronto, Detroit, Cleveland and back (followed the Washington Capitals). Here is a summary of my charging experience and costs, driving efficiency, and other observations.  

**Charging**:  This was a test road trip and overall it was a good experience.  My range anxiety has settled and I followed the advice from this subreddit on charging strategies.  Used RAN x2, Tesla x5, Chargepoint x2, and other mixed networks to add 655 kWh.  A few times I was able to charge overnight at a hotel or while parked during activities.  The superchargers are great.  See costs, load, charging times and comparison to my ICE below.  At one fully busy Tesla station, there were 3 of us Rivians.  Thankfully the first had a handicapped tag so they were able to take the far right station and we slid in side-by-side so that we wouldn't need to take two slots each.  That is definitely the way.  I felt bad the one time I couldn't get the end spot and it was near capacity.  Most of the time it wasn't an issue.  Cost ranged from $.36-$.56 per kWh for DC charging.  I wish I knew about the Tesla discount option before although I never use it normally with level 2 chargers at home, cabin, and work. 

 **Efficiency**:  I managed 2.0 miles/kWh for the full trip so worse than my normal daily driving but about what I expected.  I used cruise control most of the time and kept the max speeds around 75 mph.  I didn't fully realize before now that the efficiency pattern is flipped for EVs (more efficient city driving than highway).  On the longer drive portions in hilly western MD/PA, colder temps in the 20s, and very windy return drive the efficiency took a hit. The EPA estimated combined efficiency is 2.33.  I lost about 3% on the cold nights when I couldn't charge.  I always schedule the vehicle to warm-up before we set off and usually planned a DC charge about 60-90 minutes into each day so we could stop for breakfast but also give the vehicle time to precondition.  In addition to the Rivian navigation I also planned with ABRP and PlugShare.  

In the table below, I compared my ave cost per mile and it was surprisingly close to the cost of my inefficient 2013 Jeep 4 door Rubicon with AT tires.  I expected a little better from the R1T but I guess both are boxes on ATs.  My daily cost per mile is quite a bit better though because home electricity is $.14/kWh when I am actually paying (I have solar panels that produce most of my electricity consumption).  

**Adaptive Cruise Control**:  It worked most of the time and it was great.  I don't use the auto speed setting & lane switch but ACC is the right amount of driving control with assistance.  It was great at spotting sudden slowdowns and I love how you can leave it in ACC even if trafffic comes to a complete stop (construction, accident, etc.) and then resume.  We got stuck in an hour delay and I learned that it will switch to Hold after a long enough stop.  On two different days it stopped working mid-drive due to rainy conditions and it is jarring.  Also, I wish there was a better way to cancel although I learned to give the brake a quick tap and quickly take over the accelerator to smoothly exit ACC as I entered an exit ramp.  

**Adaptive High Beams**:  I was already in love with AHB from my previous 2 months of driving.  Until this trip  I never had any problems with AHB.  When driving through the mountains at night to my cabin AHB is great since there are few road lamps.  About 5 hours into our first day of driving I started getting error messages that AHB were not working and to get them serviced soon.  After two hard resets (not back to back), they came back after two days but failed again on another day, solved again by another hard reset.  

**Bugs, Bugs, Bugs**: Overall, the Rivian is still very buggy.  I realize it is a giant computer on wheels but I shouldn't have to perform hard and infotainment resets nearly every day to keep it in working order.  On the first day, I had some phantom gear tunnel and frunk latch sensor warnings a few times.  Both were fully latched but I have the gear tunnel issue often and usually goes away with a hard reset.  After 5 hours, many bugs came crawling out.  First the AHB issue noted above, then the music started skipping (on Spotify, Apple, and digital FM), then the UI got laggy, taking 3+ seconds to react to every command.  After 20 minutes I pulled over and did an Infotainment reset, which took care of everything.  Maybe just a small sample size but it seems like the longer you drive, the more bugs start to come out.  One evening I started the truck to completely black dash and infotainment screens.  After several minutes of staring at black screens, I did a hard reset. Eventually it came on like nothing happened.  

**Cabin Temperature Controls**: Seemed a bit hit or miss, especially in the colder temps.  I don't like air blowing on me so I prefer the cabin below 65 and just use the seat warmer (1 dot) and occassionally the floor heat.  Took me a few days to realize that the position settings for defog/defrost are different from the normal settings.  Defog works well to quickly stop your windshield and windows from fogging up.  Dual zone controls need a little improvement in cold temps especially if one person has it off or low and the other has it above 70.  

**Premium Sound System:**  Still has ISSUES.  I have had a service ticket pending from Day 1.  Better after the .43 update but like other bugs, I noticed that the sound quality degraded the longer I drove it.  On the last day, the speakers had rattles, were flat, and sounded like blown speakers even though the volume was usually around 10.  Finally had to turn it off the sound was so bad on all sources.  Also, **Rivian** please add an option to play music from an SSD.  There are long stretches of rural America that don't have strong LTE or digital FM signals so I was without music for hours.  My phone space is limited.  Also, learned the hard way that you have to park! to pair a new Bluetooth device.  Why?

**Bonus:** I learned that when you cross the border, the posted speed limits and ACC set speed automatically switch to kilometers.  Actual driving speed stays in mph if that is your setting but it adds kmph in smaller font above the mph.

One Year Review
We picked up our 2024 R1S on 12/29/2023 and drove home for 3+ hours in an “atmospheric river” downpour, roads closed and flooding – it performed amazingly! Now we have traveled 13,800 miles in “Bear,” and have loved every minute of it.

For anyone considering Buying a Rivian, here is my **One Year Review**!

I have previously owned some great SUVs, including two Lexus and a Volvo XC90 PHEV. Without question the Rivian has been far better by leaps and bounds. It has been an absolute delight to drive.

“Range anxiety” has not an issue. We have driver on numerous long trips, one towing a trailer over the Siskiyous in a storm – no problems. We have driven over Vale Pass twice in blizzard conditions, through heat, snow, and major rain, towed our camper and utility trailers, and hauled a lot of stuff without a hint of a problem. Our total mi/kwh is 2.20. I am happy with that.

We have not had any mechanical or software issues. Frankly, I think that is the norm. I have spoken to lots of Rivian owners on out travels, which has been the shared view. I am glad for that since our SC is a 3-hour drive from our house. This week Rivian is sending a mobile unit to replace our battery, I guess, a warranty issue. I had them come to rotate the tires at 7,500 mi and do an inspection.

The software update process is great. They have fixed or added many features. I love the music upgrades and now we have SiriusXM without streaming it from the phone. Also, getting the Tesla adapter is cool, though we didn’t need it on any of our trips. Other upgrades have been amazing and beneficial.

There are a few things that I would like to see in future updates. One, better texting/calling support. I understand this is coming in 2025, I cannot wait. I have grown so dependent on this feature having spent a lot of time on the road before I retired. My Volvo was amazing with this service. Second, I would love to see the frunk inside release button also serve as a close button. Not a big deal. Lastly, I want V2H bidirectional charging to work with our solar. In CA we are subject to black/brown outs and frequent power outages. Sure, I can and have plugged into the car for needed power, but I want an automatic whole house system. Rivian said they are working on a biD unit; I hope its soon and affordable.

My wife and I totally concur, the Rivian has been the best vehicle we have owned in our 50 years together. Its fun, reliable and very safe; AND we’re not burning fossil fuels. One year down and many more to go!"

Weird Supercharger encounter
We are in the middle of a roadtrip and had the weirdest reaction at a Tesla Supercharger yesterday. We have been using both Tesla Superchargers, and Electrify America preferring the Tesla chargers because they are cheaper using the membership option. Yesterday in Ft Stockton we got to the Tesla Supercharger and for some reason there was a 10 car wait with exclusively Teslas charging. As we drove in we drove past the line of cars waiting at about 10 mph. We drove in the entrance, saw the situation, and just kept going past towards the exit. As we were cruising by past the Superchargers and line towards the exit, a woman in a Tesla starts frantically waving at us. I had no idea if she was waving at us, so I kept going towards the exit. As I got to the exit which is a good ways (?50 yards)beyond the chargers I can see the same woman running towards us, motioning for us to roll down the window. I stopped thinking that there might be something wrong with our roof box or something. I was even more confused as when we rolled down the window she was super angry and frantic, and I had no idea why. She said asked if we were going to charge there, and I said no, which should have been evident as we hadn’t stopped the entire time, maintaining a steady 10 mph, and by that point were sitting in the exit. Then she said, “just so you know, if you want to charge here you have to get in line. I can’t even imagine trying to tie up two stalls in a Supercharger that backed up. The weird thing in this case is we essentially just drove by and got such an over the top reaction from someone.  We drove the couple miles to the EA charger and the 350kw charger was available, and worked no problem. "

Rivian Gen 2 Problems Resolved?
Hey guys,

As a prospective buyer, I am curious if anyone is seeing any fixes to the common problems mentioned with Gen 2 R1T and R1S yet?

1) Has the sound system improved/been fixed?

2) Is the heat pump any quieter?

3) Does Driver Assist work consistently now?

4) Has the charging speed at the superchargers gotten any better?

5) Have repair times at the service center improved?

I'm just curious as I'm still on the fence about my R1S Quad reservation.

Thoughts after a long (cold) road trip in a 2025 Standard Range R1S
My family and I recently took a \~ 1500 mile road trip (NC to VT and back) in our new 2025 Standard Range R1S. We've previously done this trip multiple times in a Model Y. I thought I'd share some thoughts.

TLDR: It was awesome! The HVAC is whack in the cold.

We had 2 adults, one child, and two large dogs in the car.

Pros:

* The car is extremely comfortable and quiet.
* The rated/stated range of the vehicle is very accurate.
* There's enough storage in the car that we did not need a roof box, but were able to bring a week's worth of supplies, dog supplies, a week's worth of clothing for another person (who flew), all of our Winter gear, and all of our Christmas presents. It was a bit cramped in the 2nd row. We had the 3rd row folded down to provide the dogs some room.
* We typically stop every \~3 hours (max) on these types of trips, so the range never was an issue. There was maybe 1 charging stop where we had to sit and wait a while in the car. The rest of the time, we were off finding lunch, bathrooms, coffee, etc.
* The Rivian Adventure Network stops were great! There were only two where we saw other Rivians and we did not need to wait at any of them. The locations generally were good. I think the new RAN behind the Ambrosia Diner, in Queensbury, NY, was our favorite. It was a perfect place to grab lunch and rest a bit. Nice diner vibe.
* The car performed wonderfully in the cold. Once the battery warmed up, our range did not drop nearly as much as we thought it would. We made the trip up to VT in 2 days, stopping in PA. We plugged into a ChargePoint at the hotel overnight (which was a trickle charge), but then turned on the climate to warm the car up about an hour before leaving in the AM. It was 1°F outside. Most of the 2nd day of the drive was below 10°F.
* Once in VT, the car performed great in the snow, on some unpaved back roads.
* The adaptive headlights are freaking awesome. I hope they're as friendly to oncoming traffic as they seem to be. It's great to get the wide spread of high beams when on back roads at night. I feel like this would really help to spot deer ready to jump on the road.
* We listened to Apple Music most of the way and it was fine.
* I used the tire inflator kit (without the emergency seal) to bring the pressure up after arriving in VT. It was super convenient, though I ended up over inflating the tires b/c the gauge on the kit is inaccurate. The cord that comes with it... there's no way I'll ever get it wound properly to fit back into the kit.

Cons:

* Something is off with the HVAC system when it's very cold. The main issue that we had is that the car would get way too hot when it was very cold outside. While set at 70°F, the cabin would routinely heat up to 88°F or higher, while driving. We found that the best way to reset it was to just turn off the A/C until it started to get chilly and then to turn it on again. This usually would lead to it working normally for a while before heating up again. We have only had this problem when it was very cold. I suspect this can be fixed with a software update? We were on the update that released at the end of November (can't remember the number).
* Because of the HVAC issue, we could not use dog mode. We repeatedly got warnings that the cabin was too hot and that the dogs might be suffering. Since they were in the way back and not jumping around in the car, we ended up just not using dog mode when parked/charging. I would just leave the climate off at first and turn on the regular climate via the app after 10 minutes or so.
* The car routed us to a non-existent Electrify America stop in Albany. That sucked and wasted a bunch of our time.
* The range estimates on the nav are less accurate and far more conservative than the range estimates on the main battery indicator, especially when the battery is getting low. This caused us some range anxiety when we were scheduled to arrive at a RAN. The nav told us we would have 10 miles of range left upon arrival when, by the time we arrived, we had \~ 25 miles of range left.
* Dear Rivian: please build a RAN in Burlington, VT and one maybe in Waterbury or Montpellier. Coming up the NY side was RAN-less. Stowe seems like a natural place for a RAN, too.
* We had mixed results at Superchargers. One of them cut us off at 82% or something and refused to start charging the car again. We found that when you start the charge via the Tesla app, that this apparently does not prevent the Rivian from going to sleep (or something). So, after leaving the car for 15 min, the charging would stop. Starting the charge by just plugging in and letting Rivian manage it did not cause the issue.
* Tesla owners seem super cranky that other brands can use the Superchargers, so we tried to avoid them.
* The trip would have been a bit better with a longer rated range on the car. This would have completely eliminated range anxiety.
* The driver/passenger headrests are uncomfortable for short people whose heads hit right at the seam/gap between the main seat and the headrest part.

I'm happy to answer any questions!"

Am I crazy? [Last Minute Cross Country Roadtrip]
I received unfortunate news that my father passed away today and I am attempting to figure out the best way home. Here are the basic details:

I live in Los Angeles full-time, but am currently up in San Francisco visiting my GF's parents. I have my dog with me, and my GF has her two dogs with her. We drove my '23 Quad, Large Pack R1T up here. The funeral will be on a TBD date back in the Pocono Mountains in PA. But I imagine it won't be until 12/30 at the earliest. 

I need to figure out some things, but I am considering leaving tomorrow morning and driving back home in my R1T. Am I absolutely batshit crazy? Both Rivian and ABRP says I'll make it, but am worried for obvious reasons. 

My dog is rather reactive (can manifest as aggression), so leaving him with my GF's parents isn't an option. Unfortunately, my dog sitter back in LA is out of town, so I couldn't drive back, leave him at home, and fly out. I also think it would be nice to have him by my side for emotional support. I also like the idea of driving as then I can stay out in PA as long as I would like afterwards.

Here's my basic plan as of now. Leave SF early in the morning as early as possible. Try to nap at charging stops along the way. Get dog-friendly hotels with EV chargers when possible. I should make it to Pennsylvania by 12/29 in the evening.  

What problems am I going to run into? How can I make this plan work as best as possible? Rivian and ABRP are currently telling me to take 80 across the country. Is that a bad idea due to cold weather? Should I try to go South, which will add more time, but keep me in warmer climates? 

Any and all advice is appreciated. "

Half the car died 
Apologies of it's against any rules, but had to post and curious if anyone else has ran into this issue.

We are the proud owner of a 2025 R1S dual max, we lucked out and found it ""used"" with ~300 miles at a dealership so we jumped on it.

We haven't had really any issues except for our older model Tesla charger in compatibly mode forces us to stop/start charging as the first charge start always fails, so that means scheduling charging doesn't really work. This in of itself is not a Rivian specific issue as it's plauging our Model 3 as well.

Back to the problem at hand: Today my wife was running around the neighborhood doing Christmas things when she called me the Rivian would not move and she could not get out of the car (she didn't know of the emergency handle).

Essentially half the car down the middle was non responsive, which is a weird statement in itself 😂. All the physical buttons on the driver's side no longer worked, the driver side headlights were out while the passenger side worked fine.

All those buttons not working meant we could not hard or soft reset as the steering wheel buttons were also non responsible.

After some reading I decided to try and jump the car via this back hitch access, and it magically started working again.

Support was super nice and had a tow scheduled but after I got it jumped I had them cancel it.

We are now scheduled to drop it off at the end of the week in the Chicago Service center. 

I am hoping it's just a 12V battery issue but seems strange for a car with < 2k miles on it.

UPDATE 1:

Dropped the R1S at the Chicago Service center. First of all a great experience overall. Communication was great and the turn around was pretty fast. Issues Monday scheduled appointment Friday (especially with Christmas in between).

Turns out a Zone Module went offline during the time of our issue, unsure if jumping the car did anything but it did force it back online.

ETA is Tuesday for parts and then will see a timeline for replacement from there.

Unfortunately they had no loaner vehicles so they set up an Enterprise rental car for the time being.

UPDATE 2:

Service got back to me today, they confirmed it is a west zone controller issue. Stated it read a normal spike in current as a short causing the module to shutdown.

ETA on part delivery is in 2 business days or so and then service will resume.

Final Update:

Got the R1S back today. Confirmed it was the West zone control module. 

It took longer to diagnose fully because they haven't had many Gen 2s in for these problems so they are building QC docs as they go if they see this again.


Overall great service experience and communication through the whole process. Them returning the rental was a big plus. 

Roughly two weeks without the car, but there was Christmas and Year's from start to finish."

Charging problems? 
Hello fellow adventurers— 

Got this error message last night before I updated new software (car was plugged in but not charging—set for midnight charge)…and again after I updated the software this morning. Tesla charger FYI. Did all of the following recommendations and still no luck. Did this happen to anyone else? Any other ideas? 🥲"

Holiday Travel Supercharging Fail…
Edit: Answered!! I was a dumby and assumed I could charge at this supercharger, but it was a V2 model and I couldn’t. Though, another Rivian owner tried the same thing, so I’m not alone in my dumbness. 

Was taking part in my yearly pilgrimage from Los Angeles to San Francisco. Ever since they’ve opened I’ve taken advantage of the RAN chargers, as they are always the most affordable and fastest. Even during holiday travel I find the wait time to be short or nonexistent compared to similar EA chargers.

This year upon my bathroom and Starbucks stop at the Buttonwillow RAN, I found that all chargers were full. Since I leave LA with 100% SOC, and typically stop every ~2 hours, I didn’t need a huge charge and figured I’d simply pay more per kWh at the adjacent SuperCharger, rather than wait for a RAN charger to open up.

Found a supercharger I could reach without blocking two stalls, plugged in, aaaaand nothing. The screen on my Rivian said “starting” for about 7minutes but never started or failed for that matter. I unplugged and tried starting the charge from my Tesla App and got the following message: “An unexpected error occurred. Cannot charge this vehicle on the Supercharger Network.” (I am paraphrasing a bit, I don’t remember the exact phrasing). 

Despite having used SuperChargers plenty of times in the past with success, I thought it was a me problem and kept trying. Eventually another Rivian owner had the same idea when the say the packed RAN chargers, but ultimately had the same issues as me and could not get the SuperChargers to work.

Eventually I got in line and waited for a RAN to open up. Luckily, it was a short wait! But if I had just waited for one originally I would have been charging much sooner. Did anyone else experience this with SuperChargers over their holiday travel? Any way to avoid or fix this in the future?

Thanks!"

R1S not charging - 1mph at 240/60amp level 2 home charger - help!
This morning temps dropped to -10F. Right now sitting between -7 and 5 depending on what thermostat I look at. The cabin is at 5 degrees. I removed the charger from my ev9 and put the R1s to charge. First 3 times I received “charging error” in red on app and the lights around the charger. Now it’s finally “charging” but it’s showing 8.6kwh instead of usual 11kwh and somehow for the first few minutes the range and charge on the vehicle went down instead of up! It’s at 81% (started at 305 miles remaining and it’s at 310 now). 

It’s reporting it will take over 25 hours to complete )81% to 100%). We were planning a long trip today so was trying to max the battery pack to ensure we don’t get stuck in the middle of nowhere without power. 

Has this ever happened to any of you? Any fixes? Anything I should be concerned about (issues with the vehicle) or is this expected because of the frigid cold temperature? The EV9 had no problems charging and is ready to go but I wouldn’t expect to get 200 miles out of a 100% charged ev9 vs maybe 300 out of the max pack on the R1s. "

R1S bricked after dead battery
So last week I had 30ish miles left on the battery before I left for a weeklong trip. I forgot to plug in before I left. I came home and the battery was totally dead, couldn’t even unlock the doors or open the charging door, assuming it phantom drained.

So I did some research and was able to access the black/red wires for the 12V battery (next to the hitch receiver). I connected it to my 4Runner with jump cables to “jump it” and was able to get it to turn on enough to unlock the doors and get the charger plugged in.

But now I am having all sorts of problems:
- only the door locks/headlight on the driver side work
- can’t turn the steering wheel
- Can’t depress the brake pedal
- getting every single warning message possible on the dash
- says my frunk hood entrapment (spelling?) isn’t working
- It is charging extremely slow, like 100 miles in 48 hours (the vehicle still won’t drive though)
- Charging sometimes work sometimes doesn’t

Basically I can’t do anything with it. I’ve tried doing the forced reboot to no avail. It’s bricked for the time being.

Does anyone have experience with this? I have a service request in the rivian app but haven’t heard back yet.

Range question (Vancouver to Whistler)
My wife and I are new Rivian owners (2025 R1S, dual, large, Gen 2, latest update installed yesterday).  It’s also our first EV, so we’re real newbies.

She drove it up to Whistler this morning, from our home in Vancouver (94 kms).  I charged it to 85% overnight and used the new feature to preheat the cabin from the charger for a 5:35am departure time (not sure if it actually worked; I was still asleep when she left).  She just arrived in Whistler with 45% remaining, so used 40% on a drive that was under 100 kms.  It’s not that cold out; 8c in Vancouver and 2c in Whistler.  Is this normal?? I assumed that 85% would be more than enough to get her the ~200kms there and back today, but nope, she’s going to have to charge up unless she wants to risk rolling home with sub-5% battery. Loving the Rivian so far, but this is a super disappointing range for a “large” battery pack.

We’ll both be doing the same Whistler drive tomorrow.  Tomorrow we’ll have a Thule rooftop box, so that won’t help range.  I’ll charge to 100% tonight, but any other tips? Maybe she’s heating the cabin too much?  I know she’s not being too heavy-footed with her driving, so doubt that’s the problem.  Is it possible there’s something wrong with the car?  Should I contact Rivian service about it?"

Maps, Alexa, and AC Issues
Hi Everyone - 

I wanted to post here about my issues when I took delivery of my new 2025 R1T on December 11th. 

1. Street View Maps - this will not load after infotainment reset and hard reset. Talking with the SC they said a module relating to maps needs to be replaced. They are having it programmed in Illinois and shipped to SC so they can replace. 

2. Alexa can’t connect - when navigating to Apps -> Alexa it doesn’t even let me sign in. It’ll just say “Can’t connect - try again later” again info/hard reset doesn’t fix. Resolution is TBD and they will look at it when they replace my mapping module. 

3. Air Conditioning - no matter what setting I put the car on (coldest or hottest) the temp does not change it just continually blows room temp air. I’ve noticed I don’t even hear the heat pump kick in when at the highest setting. Resolution TBD and they will look at it when they replace the mapping module. 

4. App connectivity - initially when I got the truck I was able to send remote commands (vent windows, change charging limit) etc. but now I always get “can’t connect” error message. I even get it when I’m in the truck! If I update a setting ie: charging limit in the truck the app will update - which is weird to me why I can’t do it the other way around. Info/hard reset doesn’t solve the problem. 

Truck goes into service on 12/26 so hoping to get more details after that. Very frustrating that after only have the truck for ~2 weeks there’s all these issues.

Key issues 


Since my GEN1 Rivian came back from service, I've been experiencing some odd key issues. It started Monday morning when I was getting ready for school. I had my phone, fob, and key card, with the app open and the fob charged, but my car showed a ""no key"" message.

I tried locking and unlocking the car with the fob, closing and reopening the app, but nothing worked. Eventually, it only recognized the key card, which I had never used until now. The only time it was used was when a tow truck driver picked up my car for service; he struggled with the fob and said he only knew how to use the card.

Now, the problem is hit or miss; sometimes it works, and other times it won’t unlock as I approach. All keys are still registered in the settings.

Has anyone encountered this issue? Any solutions would be appreciated!

——— 

**TL;DR:** After service, my GEN1 Rivian has been having intermittent key issues. Sometimes it won’t recognize my fob or phone, only the key card, which I’ve never used until now. The tow driver had trouble with the fob and mentioned he only knew how to use the card. Has anyone else faced this? Any tips?"

Any Service/Support Tips for Escalation?
23 R1T DMP. Left on cross country road trip from Seattle to South Carolina. Trip was going very well, without charging issues or infrastructure problems…until the last day when the rear motor dropped out and went into turtle mode/limited performance. Thankfully was able to finish the road trip and get the vehicle towed to the Atlanta service center on 11/21. 

They’ve had my vehicle for almost 30 days now. So far I’ve received an ‘update’ once per week, for the last 3 weeks, that my car will be assigned to a technician ‘next week’ and will provide updates after that. Again, this was supposed to be 3 weeks ago…but as of today no one has even looked at the vehicle and I received that same ‘next week’ text in my app. 

I’m incredibly frustrated at this point that no one has even looked at the truck, and then when I try to call Rivian to get some help, they do NOT return calls. They have even claimed they can’t get in contact with anyone at the service center the few times I try and go through Rivian support. I’ve only received one return call after trying to reach out to the service center (this was only to say my vehicle would be looked at next week). I’ve tried to be polite and patient (new company, growing pains…I get it), but I’ve run out of patience and I’m looking for some advice on how to escalate this issue and get some actual help. Does anyone have experience with this? I feel like this should be a pretty unusual scenario, but poking around it looks like maybe some of you have had this type of experience? TIA for any help the community might have as I try to navigate Rivian ownership. "

Day 1, problem 1 (not Rivian’s fault)
I’ve searched this, and I see that it’s not an uncommon problem, but I can’t remove the J1772 adapter from the Tesla wall connector plug.

I’ve seen advice to smack it, to shove it in hard, to do a little dance, etc. I’ve tried them all and none have worked.

The good news is that it charges the R1S no problem. The bad news is that I need to charge my Tesla too until I sell it.

Any words of wisdom?"

why on screen nav arriving range very badly predicted?
I just had a road trip and I have experienced very bad arriving range estimation for on screen nav

  
I was doing DC fast charger to DC fast charger road trip and next DC fast charger on route was 135 miles away, Rivian wanted me to charge up to 203miles of range, I left when charged to 155 miles I had no problem reaching the next DC fast charger with 20+ miles of range left

  
On the route, On screen nav was keep saying I can't make it to next charger, is Rivian working on improving the estimation?"

The 'we're just a startup' excuse
First of all I love my Rivian. Whole heartedly.  However, I'm growing increasingly frustrated with the attitude of the service folks, and also folks in the company that I've talked to. 

R1S GEN2.  Just two months old

Going into it, I knew the cars had some problems. I accepted the risk, but I thought the support structure would be so much more better. Service has been really pathetic,  mobile service was useless the one time they came.  Dent on the speaker grill, several (many many times) errors with sensors that come and go. Window seal falling off. None of these are major issues, but they require some attention on a brand new car. I have opened many tickets, they said they would call back but nothing. No calls, no follow up. Just another mobile appointment in the very distant future.  Oh and alignment is still off :)

She mentioned several times how they were a startup. Service at Richmond, over 3 hours away from me said the same. We're a startup. I mean so what?  I didn't pay startup prices for the car. It was well over 100k. How long can you keep telling this to your customers? The startup argument is a valid one, but you are charging high prices for the new cars, you are also cutting back on things as you are charging more, such not having a fob that I miss. But service is such a big part of the experience, especially when you have issues with the vehicle.

  
I'm getting super frustrated, but I still like the car. I don't think I will recommend it to others. I certainly cannot talk highly about service to anyone else.  I know folks here have had really great experience with service, and my post is highly redundant now that this subreddit is getting big, but this venting helps a lot. lol. Thanks for listening."

PSA some A2Z Typhoon Pro adapters do not work with V4 Superchargers
I was just in a road trip for thanksgiving and unexpectedly all of the superchargers we hit were V4 and they all had their magic docks locked.  When we tried to charge (on many different chargers at 3 locations) using the A2Z adapter neither the car or the charger recognized it as plugged in.  We made it to an EA station with 6 miles left few.

After some research I found someone who had the same problem and posted a pic of their bad adapter.  It is super easy to check by looking at the NACS side of the adapter and seeing if the two metal lower outer connectors  are the same length.  A2Z has since sent a replacement and the new one appears to be fine but have yet to test it.

The problem with EVs
I’ve owned a R1T for 2 1/2 years. 
The problem with EVs is the issue I ran into last night. I’m staying in the casino in Cherokee TN w several chargers in the parking garage for free.  I am only staying one night and figured I could leave it plugged in all night and in the morning I would be good to go, but nope! I waited a while to see if it would be good enough for my ride back home and sadly it was ridiculously slow - my home charger takes 6 hours for a full charge but I had 10 hours at the hotel so I thought it should have been ok. After an hour, I had only gained 6 miles. So after 10 that would only be 60. That’s dumb. They should not even install chargers that slow. I then made my way to a Rivian charger less than 1 mile away (thank heavens it’s a super charger) and paid $21 for 20 min of charging that got me back to 50% which gives me enough for now.  Please don’t install “trickle” EV chargers - it’s a waste of time and money.  The charging network needs to be improved to gain wider acceptance. "

NO GPS Rivian says bring it to SC
Update! It was a software bug after all! The fix is simple. Unplug the USB Hard drive for gear guard and reboot the UI or the whole vehicle. Leave the HD D unplugged until Rivian sends a new patch to fix it. My hard drive and GPS worked fine until one of the last 2 patches broke it. I am sure they will fix it. I plan to let Rivian know so they can update their Helpdesk manuals. Thanks Oafyone!


Hi All, about 6 weeks ago after the Halloween update, I noticed my R1S Launch Edition would lose track of whether I was at home occasionally. I had to reset my home address in maps to make it come back. After the most recent update, I lost gps completely. 

It may have been coincidental, but it feels like a software issue since I have had zero problems with GPS before these updates. I have tried the AV restart twice and hard rebooting twice on several occasions each. Each time GPS works for a couple of minutes and then goes to no-GPS. 

This was a real pain on a long road trip recently because I couldn’t get the battery conditioning for fast charging. 

Is this really something I have to go to a SC for? They are backed up until mid January.

Think Twice About the R1S Being Your Primary Car
I’ve had my Gen 2 Rivian R1S for about three months, and while I wanted to love it, the experience has been less than smooth.

Here’s what’s been going on:

1. Initial Quality Issues

Right out of the gate, there were small but frustrating problems:
	•	A rip in the headrest.
	•	Panel gaps that stand out more than they should.
	•	And an odd wind noise that makes it sound like a sunroof is open whenever you’re driving over 50 mph—except the car doesn’t have a sunroof.

2. Charging Problems

At first, I brushed off the little things, but then the car stopped fast charging altogether. After five calls to Rivian support, I’m still waiting for an appointment to address it.

3. Airport Incident

The most frustrating experience, though, happened after a 7-day trip. I left the car parked at an airport charger and landed late at night after delays, traveling with my toddler and baby. All I wanted was to get home quickly.

When I got to the car, it decided that was the perfect time to install an update. No warning, no option to delay—it just locked me out until the update was complete.

I called Rivian Roadside Assistance, hoping they had a way to cancel the update. Their response? They couldn’t help, but I was politely reminded that I should’ve turned off OTA updates in the settings. I didn’t realize this was something I needed to think about when just trying to get from point A to point B.

4. Final Thoughts

If you’re considering the R1S as your primary vehicle, I’d recommend thinking twice. It’s not that the car doesn’t have its strengths, but moments like these make it hard to trust as your main mode of transportation.

For now, I’m just grateful for the reliability of my other EV (a BMW iX) and am counting down the days until the lease is up.

Edit: Just a side note—it’s wild how defensive some people in this group get. I’m just sharing my experience with the car, but it feels like some owners are taking it as a personal attack on their Rivian. Not meant to be that at all. "

Rivian after Seattle's bomb cyclone
There have been a few posts on the storm that hit Seattle and how powering essential items with our Rivian's saved the day, certainly the case for me, as I was without Power from Tuesday night to Sunday morning.

After going through that I got to thinking how can I power my house without running extension cords and I think I found a solution.

Firstly, I got one of the Anker Solix F3800, for two reasons, price and it has an EV port and can confirm charging my Rivian at 5.5 KW without issue. The thinking was that I can simply charge up the F3800 with the truck and effectively I would have a 6Kw output backed by 100KW of battery, with the F3800 battery taking any heavy loads while I ""trickle"" charge it from the truck. Most of the time my load is well below 1Kw, so I should be able to keep it topped up.

The unfortunate part is that you can't AC charge and use 240V at the same time. However, it does support 2, 1200W solar inputs for a total of 2400W of solar input. After a bit of searching, I found this very useful video on how to solve that problem, details in this video [https://youtu.be/T\_zZceBWZHk?si=1x3pUeRq8tYZ8tWI](https://youtu.be/T_zZceBWZHk?si=1x3pUeRq8tYZ8tWI) In full disclosure, I've not actually tried it yet but looks to be the best way forward and will be investing further. 

I don't have any affiliation with any of these products/videos just sharing an approach to a problem if it helps others."

R1S doesn’t want to charge past 70%
Hi all, we’ve had our R1S for a little over a week and have our first problem to report. We received it with 80% charge and have charged it from upwards of 70% at times going down to the 40% range at one point, nothing to extreme. We are set for a smaller road trip for Thanksgiving tomorrow so wanted to charge to 90%. The truck keeps disconnecting it’s charging for some reason. I’ve done a full reset and am going to let it sit for an hour before retrying. I’m wondering if the BMC needs some sort of calibration? Has anyone experienced this before? Using Rivian’s own L2 charger btw. 

Edit: After the full reset and 1 hour wait, charging past 70% appears to be working. I’m at 82% now. I’m beginning to think this was something related to the BMS being in some non-calibrated state, but just a theory. Hope this post helps others with similar issues!"

How many of you have the 2024.43 software update?
About a week ago, my GPS stopped working. It's inconvenient, but I have my phone to help navigate instead. I called my closest SC, and their earliest appointment is at the end of January. Not too big of a deal in the grand scheme of things. 

However, we're going on a road trip on Saturday, and it has dawned on me that we'll have a hell of a time figuring out charging on our route. I've done multiple hard and soft resets, which haven't worked.

This leads me to my question. My car's current software is 2024.39.01. I'm wondering if the problem will be fixed if I have the latest version, but it looks like 2024.43 hasn't been released across the board, yet. I've made sure that my car is connected to my WiFi whenever I'm home, and I've also turned off and turned on the WiFi to make sure it's working right. Chatting with tech support on the app hasn't been helpful. 

So how many of you have the latest software version? Do I have a super long time to wait, still? 

Thanks so much for any info you guys have! This community has always been so helpful!"

2025 R1T Tri: One Week In
I picked up my 2025 Rivian R1T Tri a little over a week ago.  Here are my thoughts of the experience so far, coming from a 2007 Accord.

Ordering/Pickup:
The interface for ordering the truck was pretty slick, although the limestone color is more blue and less green in real life.  The estimated wait time from order to pickup was accurate.  They notified me about 2 weeks out that it was going to be a week late. It turned out to be ready on the originally expected day which was a nice surprise.  Pickup was great, staff were very helpful and friendly.

Driving: Joyful to drive.  Responsive with acceleration and turns.  Haven’t tried any offroad modes.  The throttle mapping and regenerative braking makes driving with one pedal very easy.  The truck is wider than what I am used to so parking is still tricky, but the top-down camera angle is such a great help and brilliant implementation.

Reliability: In the 9 days I’ve been driving, I had to schedule a service call once.  The forward collision warning system telltale icon lit up on the dash.  They had me do a software reset which fixed it.  The next day, the same collision warning system icon plus a different icon for a fuse problem or something popped up.  Thankfully these just went away shortly thereafter without me doing anything.  I am a little alarmed that these problems are present within the first week of driving the truck.  Nothing game-breaking so far though.

Charging:  Charging at home with a Generac level II charger presented no issues.  I got the promised NACS adapter 1 week after picking up the truck, but there aren’t any superchargers compatible with non-Teslas near me.  Charging at Chargepoint brand chargers away from home has been easy, although I have used my credit card every time.  I’m not sure what the purpose of making us link the Rivian account to Chargepoint is.  The other two types of chargers I’ve used on the road both just didn’t work (Electrify America and something else) - they failed to start charging and the truck said “waiting on charger”.  So I don’t think that is a Rivian problem.

Sound:  I was worried because of what has been said about 2025 Rivians and sound quality is important to me.  On default settings, music sounded like listening to a phone in a tin can. Mid range was way too prominent and vocals sounded muddy, basically all around trash.  My 2007 Honda OEM speakers and OEM system sounded significantly better.  HOWEVER with some tweaking of the equalizer (boosting bass and treble, lowering mids) I have found settings that sound decent.  Even the bass, while somewhat underwhelming, sounds formidable without muddying the sound.  I did turn off 3D sound which made a small difference.

The Rivian system sounds are pleasant.  The turn signal can be hard to hear over music because it is so low-pitched.  I am looking forward to having more choices for the lock sound.  In fact, options to customize more sounds in general would be welcome.


Music software:  I’m using Apple Music, which brings me to my next point: the Apple Music implementation leaves much to be desired.  After starting the truck it usually takes 5+ minutes for Apple Music to finish loading or connecting or whatever it is doing to get ready to play music.  The system rarely remembers what I was listening to, and each time I get in, I have to select music.  I really wish it would remember where I was or at least which song/playlist was playing, and start playing automatically.  It does not remember my search history despite having an area that says “your recent searches will appear here”.  The navigation is much worse than Apple 
Music on an iPhone.  Tapping the artist or album name on the “now playing” area, for example, does nothing.  If I want to go to the album or artist for the song currently playing, I have to go back to search.  The music library interface sometimes doesn’t let me look at all of an artist’s albums or songs, only the top 4 or 5.  Again, having to search by typing out the album or song is the only way to find many songs - this is dangerous when driving. There isn’t even an option for voice-to-text when typing on the Rivian.  Also the Rivian integrated Alexa has no connection to Apple Music, even though the Alexa in my house does?  I can’t even ask Alexa to play a song or an artist.  That is silly to me. I’m logged in to my amazon account in the Rivian, and when I “announce” it announces on Alexa in my house.  I can play Apple Music at my house through Alexa but not in the car.  

Also, as far as I can tell, the only volume control is on the steering wheel.  There should be a volume control on the main screen as well - it doesn’t make sense to have to use the screen to open the music app, find the album or song and press play, then have to go over to the steering wheel to adjust the volume.  In short, the Apple Music interface is clumsy and feels like it is made for toddlers.  It should more closely match the functionality of the same app on iPhone.  I haven’t tried any other music apps on Rivian. As an alternative to Apple Music, Bluetooth works and is straightforward (although lesser sound quality). 

Driving Assist features:  The highway driving assist (which is cruise control + matching the car in front of you’s speed + staying in lane + switching lanes when desired) is limited to certain roads under certain conditions and requires constant attention.  It is helpful and does reduce fatigue while driving.  As it develops and expands I think it will be very helpful.  I don’t expect full self driving (nor am I particularly interested) any time soon.  The auto-adjusting high beams are awesome, maybe my favorite feature.  It is so cool to see them turn off in selective areas when there is an oncoming car or a car in front of you.  

Storage:  There is so much storage!  Under the truck bed, the gear tunnel, the gear tunnel doors, under the front seats, the console, the front trunk.  But no sunglasses storage area!  Not a huge deal but just something small that most cars have, even the most basic.  The power tailgate drop and powered tonneau are nice to have.  It would be nice to have a manual backup option for them too.  Same with the gear tunnel.  In fact, it would be nice to have a mechanical emergency brake as well.  I just don’t trust all-electronic interfaces.  

Other: The optional roof window opacification toggle is a necessity unless you live in a place without sunlight.  Being able to turn it on and off is almost as good as having a sunroof, but if it was clear all the time it would get really hot in the cabin.  
Air conditioning and ventilated seats are great, what a luxury!!  I find it annoying to adjust airflow direction with a touchscreen, but that’s subjective.  
I have gone through automatic carwashes twice without any issues.  I added a 1TB SDD to use drivecam and it seems to work fine, the process was easy.

Overall:  My biggest complaint is with the implementation of Apple Music and the sound system/interface in general.  Everything else has been great so far.  There are some things I would change but I am glad I decided to go with a Rivian.  

PS altogether banning use of the word “st0ck” in the body of a post is a really stupid way to prevent discussion of st0cks. I’m trying to describe speakers that came with the car and can’t use st0ck. "

Rivian and A2Z adapters.  
The good news is I got my adapter from Rivian a few days ago.  Then today I got a recall notice from A2Z.  Looks like Tesla got after them about the switch problem.  

IMPORTANT SAFETY RECALL

NHTSA Recall # : 24E094

Dear A2Z EV customers,

This notice is sent to you in accordance with the National Traffic and Motor Vehicle Safety Act.

A2Z EV has decided that a defect, which relates to motor vehicle safety exists in certain original NACS to CCS1 Adapter, the Typhoon Adapter (V1 with the slider lock). Through this recall, you can receive an improved Typhoon Pro (V2 Adapter - No slider lock), which features a more robust locking mechanism designed to enhance overall safety and usability.

Why We're Offering This Exchange

We received feedback from Tesla suggesting alleged concerns regarding the locking mechanism and surface temperature. We provided Tesla with multiple internal and external testings and reports, but a mutual agreement could not be reached. No safety event has been reported whatsoever.

Locking Mechanism : Over time, and after approximately 10,000 cycles of insertion and withdrawal, the retaining force of the locking mechanism on the V1 adapter's NACS inlet may degrade. This degradation could lead to a reduction in the locking force, potentially affecting the secure retention of the NACS connector during use. If the locking mechanism is degraded, the adapter may completely stop working as a safety measure.

High-Amperage Charging :

In conditions where the adapter is used at high amperage (≥500 amps) for extended periods (e.g., one hour or more), the surface temperature of the V1 adapter may rise by approximately 5-10°C over what the standard prescribes. This increase could exceed maximum temperature standards for EV charging equipment, more specifically adapters, potentially leading to a reduction in power or a complete halt in the charging session to maintain safety.

To mitigate the risk of personal injury, users must always ensure the adapter’s locking mechanism is used as intended. The adapter’s surface temperature may get hot if used for sustained periods of use.

We are providing the Typhoon Pro/V2 adapter to address any risks, incorporating a new locking mechanism that is easier to use and better aligned with recent advancements in EV safety standards. This will be provided to you free of charge.

Then more stuff on the exchange.

Is the Rivian flashlight battery covered by warranty?
I believe the problem is the battery but even after charging for hours, my flash/torch light, barely produces any light. It’s dim to almost no light but you can see the LED SMD glowing. I tried with a firend’s battery and it did turn on to 100% brightness.

I wonder if any of you have had issues and was successful in getting it replaced."

Trip Planner with Different Starting Charges
I really like the Rivian app trip planner in many ways except for one item that seems so obvious to be included I wonder if I am just missing how to do it?

Specifically, is there a way to run the trip planner with a different starting charge than your Rivian currently has?

Example: My R1T is currently at 70% charge as I always keep it at for day-to-day use. I am planning a trip a few days from now that will likely have me charging to 100% before departure due to distance and I want to plan and figure out my charging stops, route, etc. now, not right when leaving in a few days. Problem is that, in the trip planner, I have the option to choose my departure time, preferred charging networks, arrival range, drive mode, and trailer status, but NOT the ability to have the calculation run assuming I start with 100% or some other percentage at the outset. I can change arrival percentage, but not departure percentage. I am forced into a starting charge of whatever my R1T currently is at. 

I realize the point of this being default is likely to avoid someone thinking they can make it someplace when that level of charge doesn't exist at the moment, but is there really no way to ""game out"" the trip with different starting charge levels? I don't want to charge to 100% days before needing to just to make those plans, and it seems a bit silly to have to figure it out in Google Maps or something else due to this limitation.

Is there something I am missing, or is this just something to add to my feature wishlist?"

Trip from Dallas to Sante Fe, NM
I did another post about a trip from Dallas to Springfield, MO and tried to detail out as much as possible. Here, I want to contrast that trip a bit with my trip to Sante Fe, NM.

**Pre-trip Planning and Service**  
One major note, I want to call out the service in Dallas. I've been pretty vocal about my dislike for the customer service from Rivian. I'd feel like it is disingenuous not to call out some improvements I saw. I had a seal on my window which was bad, and I scheduled an appointment with them. It did take a month, but...

* They called me earlier in the week to confirm the appointment. They mentioned something I didn't ask for which was replacement of 12v battery. I didn't ask for it, but I guess they handled it a bit like a recall and said they were just doing it to trucks which came out of the factory the same time as mine.
* They had a person who greeted me upon arrival - and that person was available in the waiting room the whole time. (YAY! Good improvement Rivian. I complained about this earlier.)
* They saw me that day. I didn't have to get a rental car. My appointment was an actual appointment.
* The person there noticed another bigger issue with the seal. They fixed that too. In doing so, they missed the original seal, but fixed that after.

All in all, a very large improvement, and since this was the day before my trip, it really helped.

About a month before this trip, I had not received a notification of getting the Tesla adapter. I did order the A2Z adapter because based off of what I was seeing, I would not have made it to Sante Fe without either going out of my way by like 5 hours, or I would have to have an adapter. Of course, a few days after getting my A2Z adapter, I got the mail from Rivian that my free adapter was on the way. Given that I didn't want to use the A2Z adapter and potentially void warranty or whatever, I was glad though a little frustrated in timing.

I plotted out this trip with Plugshare. I scheduled 3 stops throughout the trip. I tried to leave about 100 to 80 miles in case the charging station was down and I needed to move on to a different one. The thing about this trip was that there weren't many alternative charging stations... at all. It really needed to be carefully planned and I definitely had some range anxiety.

**Adapter and Tesla Network**  
Getting on the road, the big takeaway should be that the adapter was not only necessary, it just made everything so much easier. I tried a Tesla charger three days before the trip. I made a mistake and thought I needed to pull up the Tesla app to use it. I did not. I just had to plug in and everything started. INCREDIBLE! It also showed the charge realtime on my Rivian's screen. My first stop on the trip was a Tesla station and I just plugged in and everything worked instantly. There were plenty of stations. I can't even stress how much of a better experience this is.

**Mileage and Range Anxiety**  
The second thing I should note is that the mileage that is showing on the battery is still not very useful, but the battery amount you will be at when you arrive at your destination is pretty good. I did not drive in Conserve mode, I went Standard the whole way. I feel iffy about hearing Conserve mode puts more wear on my tires, especially since I just replaced them at under 20K miles. (14K for the curious) Not sure if that rumor is true, but I am being careful. I tended to get about 210-230 miles out of a charge in Standard. (Note this calculation comes with remaining battery.) Also, 21"" wheels. That's a far cry from 256 that it is showing. Wind conditions, elevation, etc. I just wanted to note this because people should plan, IMO, for about that amount when using Plugshare.

(Weird bug - I set up my trips to allow it to show stops that required an adapter on the Rivian nav. Somehow this got turned off? It made battery pre-conditioning non-existant on the trip to Sante Fe because I had to plug in addresses versus being able to see the Tesla chargers on the trip.)

I did have one scare where I stopped early because I was worried about the mileage not being what I originally thought it was going to be. It was going to be a little closer than I liked making it to Santa Rosa. I stopped in Tucumcari, NM after charging in Amarillo. I made the mistake of stopping at a non-adapter Tesla place. I went several miles further to the original CCS place in Sante Rosa, NM. I got there with about 40 miles remaining. That made my butt pucker a bit. (Not because I was worried about making it there, but it was the ONLY option.) I could have just gone to another place in Tucumcari as there was a CCS charger at a Love's Travel station there. I just didn't see it on the Rivian planner, probably because it was behind me.

That station was Electrify America, and sure enough, something went wrong in charging. I tried to use the app, but it never registered the app properly so I had to use a credit card and be a ""guest"" in the system. I had to do the same on the return leg of the trip. Not the end of the world, but certainly a far cry from just plugging in at a Tesla charger.

**Final Thoughts**  
This was a much harder trip than the one to Springfield as I knew it would be. Charger options were very limited without the option of a lot of bailout points along the trip. I absolutely could not have made it without the adapter. I was really far from everything and I traveled alone. What I didn't expect is, if given a choice, I will never stop at another Electrify America, EVGo or any other station than Tesla if I don't have to. The number of stalls, the ease of use, etc. was great.

Also, this isn't an easy trip. Its boring as hell. Even in a gas vehicle stops are not plentiful. Its a bladder workout for sure. Still, I made it in the Rivian without much problem on the whole. Yes, I was very careful in my planning, but nothing major occurred. In fact, as a bonus, the hotel in Sante Fe had a charger and I left there with 100% charge. In fact, if it wasn't for my own doubts, this trip was done pretty easily in an EV - with access to Tesla network."

Question about charging SE USA
I’m in Kentucky and taking a trip to New Orleans next week. Was planning on driving the Rivian as I’ve not yet taken it on a road trip. Done lots of trips in my Tesla and had no problems. But looking at the charging options, it looks like there’s a charging desert from Birmingham to NO and basically no where to charge in Mississippi. 

Am I looking incorrectly or would that be a trip to advise against? "

Fantastic purchase and driving experience with R1S Tri
Took delivery of a Tri Max all terrain storm blue R1S with premium sound two weeks ago (my first EV). I put 1,500+ miles on it tooling around the Texas Hill Country and in city traffic. The SUV performs extremely well. I tested it extensively, and everything just works.

The purchase process was easy and Rivian was responsive. About a month out from my delivery date, I asked my guide to get the process started for my Tesla adapter. I received it a week or so before my delivery date. I also asked to see the car before sending payment. They kindly let me stop by and do a quick check the day before I took delivery. I thoroughly checked all the panel gaps and climbed under the car to inspect during delivery. All were spot on.

The vehicle drives well. It feels solidly built and handles nicely on both the interstate and rural roads. I haven’t done much off-road yet, but hope to in a few months. The storm blue color is fantastic and I love how the hue appears to change a bit depending on the light. Charging was easy and after adjusting the audio using the settings recommended by this sound engineer, it’s pretty good to my ear. The vocals are crisp.

I’m very happy with the usability of the controls. I’ve had no problem going through the car wash, managing charging, changing lighting, or customizing the vehicle to my preferences. Of course, I did read the manual a couple times before taking delivery. Nevertheless, the interface is intuitive and I appreciate that it doesn’t shout at me to be noticed. With the exception of the 36 hour hiccup with the Halloween update, all over the air updates have worked seamlessly.

All in all, it’s been a terrific experience for me and I’ve recommended this car to friends and family. Although not my goal, it’s a head turner and I’ve had people come out of neighborhood shops to ask about it and offer compliments. Thanks to all at Rivian who worked to create this game changing adventure vehicle and to the redditors whose posts helped me pull the trigger. "

Road trip
Took a trip from Las Vegas NV to Albuquerque, first road trip 3 charging stops. First stop I dropped to 7 percent (massive range anxiety) lesson learned lol! Lunch in Gallup charge while eating Blake's lotta burger. Then on to ALB. Was a great exp. Used RAN  charg3rs mostly.  Now the funny part. Charging using the supercharger in Abq.  While charging numerous diesel trucks ""rolled coal"" on all of us charging and the others drove by reving their engines. I should of had score cards to rate them. The Tesla guys had no problem with me using the chargers and had a 20 minute Convo with a cybertruck dude. Anyhow. Loving this truck!

My R1S Nightmare
First of, I really like the car, it’s design, interior and the ride. I had a Model 3 before that and I am really impressed with it and I really want to love it because it’s great - when it works.

I had many issues starting with systems disabling one after another and putting the car in limp mode while I was on the express way going to work. When I made it back home, I reached out to service via chat and they responded within minutes and I was connected to a person who tried their best to help me. That’s awesome. Kudos Rivian, this is really good. 

The solution was to reboot the car several times in several ways until the warnings disappeared. Hmmm. Does anyone remember Windows 95? That worked kind of the same way. But then this was probably a one time occurrence and I wasn’t the only one here that experienced this.

A week or so later, when we took the car on a longer road trip for the first time, the RAN charger disconnected with a “vehicle error”. Since we were at 90% (I have the LFP battery), it was kind of ok and we continued on our trip. No issues charging the other times on the trip though we never went as high of a soc as 90% again. Tesla SC was ok with the A2Z Typhoon adapter from Canada! Salut a Montreal! 

The following week, while charging at work on a ChargePoint Level 2 charger, I am receiving the “Vehicle Error - Unplug and try again” not once but two times - both times I charged that week. So maybe there’s something going on. I didn’t contact support with it yet. It seemed to random still. 

Then the following Sunday, after driving my friend to the airport, the car said “Critical Battery Issue - Service Immediately” and it wouldn’t move anymore. Luckily chat support responded and after resetting and deep sleep and other things, we were able to clear the warning and the car would drive again.

Now I am a bit concerned that those issues are not glitches but actual symptoms of more significant problems with the electronics. 

I’ve reached peak problem state when I couldn’t pair my new iPhone as a key yesterday and despite the best efforts of support to walk me through the troubleshooting steps, the issue remains. The phone keys that I previously added through the app for me and my wife are still shown in Settings > Drivers & Access though I have tried (and failed) multiple times to remove them. Now I cannot re-add them because I cannot tap the “Setup” button. Because it’s not shown.

Now I am actually quite convinced that there is an underlying problem that surfaces with different symptoms. My theory is - and it might be completely bonkers - that due to the zonal architecture, different ECUs are taking over certain tasks but if one of them throws an error, then multiple resets and deep sleep states might result in other units that are not suffering from a fault or some issue taking over that work and clearing the previously issued warning. 

While I understand that there are growing pains especially for a new product with this insane complexity but this is a Gen2. I would expect service to slot me in earlier than 1.5 months out to diagnose the problem. I’m starting to read about the California lemon law. I think it's ok that the car has problems, but not fixing them is not right. I understand they are busy at the SC but at this point, I don't care. Fix it or give me a new one. 

I really want to like the car but these experiences make it quite difficult and I begin to feel regret (or leaser’s remorse)."

Pre-mature L2 charging stops at Home
I've been having an issue with home charging recently, and I'm curious if anyone else has had the same problem and knows how to resolve it:



Problem: home L2 charging session ends early, far before the configured charging limit.  Charging will resume if you open drivers side door, or if you unplug/replug the charging cable.



Frequency: this has happened to me 4 times since the upgrade to 2024.35.0 which happened on September 27th (which was 11 days ago).  I didn't track it's frequency before that, but I seem to recall it not happening as much before this latest software update.

  
Context: Gen2 R1S Dual Max. My home charging setup is a Tesla Universal Wall Connector, which is configured in legacy/compatibility mode.  It's configured for 48A charging, and is connected to a 60A breaker with 6AWG wire.

  
Anyone else have a similar problem?  Any known solutions?

  
I have opened a ticket with Rivian to have them investigate, but am curious if others have seen the same or if I've got something weird going on at my house.  Thanks!"

Charging station regulation
When do you suppose we’ll get to some actual charging station regulations? On a broader more obvious side of things, Im talking about stations being broken down all the time but there’s other problems to consider. Station locations Ive found to be wildly inaccurate. Ive also run into stations being listed as available, but in reality they’re inside a private condo association or in an office building private lot. My final annoyance is why does every brand require a separate app, separate handshake system and separate payment setup? This whole thing needs to be overseen and regulated and simplified or the “normies” or ney-sayers or the just the people on the fence wont convert. "

From Tesla to Rivian: Early Impressions
**Background**

Going from '23 Tesla M3P (10K miles) to '25 Gen 2 R1S Dual Max. Also still drive a Model Y (20K miles). I am sharing this because I sure a lot of people have or know someone that has a Tesla and may be looking for their next EV. Hopefully this helps, but do keep in mind, your miles may vary. 

  
**Delivery Day Experience and Issues**

Tesla: Was ordered as an existing inventory order. Delivered 3 days after ordering. Many issues such as sagging headliner, floppy door seals, 1-2 pain chips/pain defects, a loud, abnormal whining sound from the rear motors, scratched wheel were the more notable problems. Otherwise, we were allowed to see the car before accepting delivery. Overall, felt like a poor built but nothing too major to cause me to reject delivery

  
Rivian: Initially a custom ordered, no updates for almost 1 month until salesperson reached out to me about a similar config in the shop. Changed order to that and took delivery 3 weeks later. Was allowed to inspect the car for 45 mins before accepting delivery. Only issues noted on delivery day was minor paint hazing the size of a half dollar, hood is not fully centered. After 300 miles, other issues noted were rattles on both front doors, driver side mirror vibration (may be normal?), some missing clips on front door seals. So far minor fit/finish issues and no major error messages.

  
*Winner: Rivian*

  
**Service**

Tesla: Plenty of available appointment times and multiple service centers in a 30 mile radius. Car was in service 3 times in the first 2 months. Total of almost 3 weeks as they had to send the car one time to a body shop for some paint correction. Besides the wheel exchange because of the scratched wheel and paint correction, no other issues were resolved. The most frustrating thing was the lack of communication from the service centers and despite initially being told that some of the issues were not normal, after the car was returned to me, they said those same problems were within specs. The reps were caught straight up lying because they mentioned my car was almost ready for pick up but just needed to be washed but when I drove there, the car was in the same parking spot I left it at and service has not even started. 4th service visit at a different service center, they finally diagnosed the rear motor whining sound and replaced the whole motor. Alas, the sound was gone. Other fit/finish issues remained unresolved. 

  
Rivian: No service visit yet because, well, they are 2-3 months out. Cannot comment on the quality of work but the lack of timely appointments is concerning. Thank goodness my issues are very minor. I do have to commend Rivian for reaching out to me about every issue I brought up to get more information and see how they can triage it. 

  
*Winner: Rivian, because so far, has better communication with the customers. They* definitely *need to expand their service center network*

  
**Driving Experience**

Obviously 2 completely different vehicles but both drive well. I love the instant acceleration and responsiveness of the accelerator with the M3P and how well the handling was. The R1S feels tanky but yet very maneuverable. There is an obvious lag with the  R1S accelerator but it probably still accelerates faster than most cars on the street. The M3P seemed like a more tuned vehicle. The R1S excels in a smoother ride quality, less road noise and vibration because of the bigger tires. I give the R1S a slight edge with wind noise but it is by no means quiet going freeway speeds. Of course, the M3P is a more efficient car because of its size so I felt less guilty about having lead foot while driving it.

  
**Software**

Tesla: Took a bit to get used to a software-based car after only driving ICE vehicles but after the initial learning curve, the experience was smooth, intuitive, and hassle free. Really only had to reset the screen 2-3 times for minor freezing issues. I love pin to drive because it adds an extra layer of security without being cumbersome. Love the auto cancel turn signals, auto side mirror fold based on location, green light chime, Netflix/YouTube while charging, and PAAK just worked seemlessly.  The Energy tab detailing your expected use vs actual on a graph as well as indicating what components are using energy are very helpful on long car rides. 

Rivian: Obviously not as refined as Tesla but it is also not bad and seems like it is continuously getting better. I do hate how there is no dedicated Home Screen. I don't think it would be too difficult to default to an app after inactivity while driving. The screen is laggier than Tesla's but not too far off. Their Energy and Nav Apps leave a lot to be desired. I wish they would focus on refining the other apps instead of greatly focusing just on the Drive app as I am sure most owners are leaving the same drive mode settings 80-90% of the time. We also need a Keep mode and improved PAAK functionality. 

  
*Winner: Tesla*

  
**App**

Tesla, hands down as well. Some things I miss going to the Rivian include the ability to start Pet Mode in the app, detailed charging section specifically detailing the cost of charging at home, live sentry mode view>>Gear Guard live (granted this is brand spanking new on the Rivian), more detailed remote climate controls. Rivian definitely has a solid app and many probably prefer it to Tesla's.

  
*Winner: Tesla*

  
**Sound System**

Tesla, end of story. Rivian's premium sound system is a joke. It is flat, muffled, and feels one dimensional. I shouldn't have to experiment with EQ setting for a >$90K car csound system, Tesla's wasn't the greatest I have heard but definitely lightyears better that what Rivian is offering in their Gen 2s. I don't even know where the EQ setting are on the Tesla because I never felt like I had to use it. 

  
*Winner: Tesla*

  
**Others**

* Rivian's HVAC > Tesla, albeit much louder and less efficient. It cools the cabin than the M3P but it is also 2x the cabin size. And I live in Phoenix where is has been >110F multiple days in September so preconditioning the car is a must
* Rivian's built quality is spectacular. It just feels solidly built. I am disappointed about the small rattles though but they are much quieter than the ones that developed in our Model Y
* It is harder to curb rash a Rivian for sure
* Storage space in the Rivian is functional and flexible. The frunk and sub trunk are HUGE. 
* I do not use autonomous driving features much but I wish the Rivian's system can be activated on more roads. 
* Rivian's nav system's rerouting LAGS. Can be dangerous and definitely frustrating
* Rivian needs auto cancel turn signal ASAP
* Glass roof on both are fine without tinting. Gets hot but AC can keep up. You might feel the heat more in the M3P because your head is closer to the roof but not once did I ever feel like I needed to tint it or get a shade. The Rivian's glass roof get warm as well but same story as the Tesla except your head is much futher away as well so the heat doesn't as strong. Remember. I live in Phoenix.  Both cars have Xpel ceramic tints on all other windows, however. A must

I'm sure there are so many more things I can list but can't remember right now. 

  
**TL;DR: Service, Built quality: Advantage Rivian; Software, app, sound system: Advantage Tesla**

Edit: To clarify I think that the HVAC in Rivians is better because despite it being louder and slower to cool the larger cabin, I find myself not having to go colder on the temp to achieve the same comfort level as I have to do in my Tesla. Basically, Rivians AC blows colder. "

[Question] Trouble Fast Charging My R1S at EVgo Stations—Anyone Else?
So, I recently tried to fast charge my R1S at an EVgo 350kW station. Everything started off fine, but within two minutes, the charging stopped and I got an error message saying, “Unplug charger and let it cool.” 🤨

I waited for a bit, but no luck—the car just wouldn’t charge at that station anymore. I ended up switching to a 100kW charger nearby, which worked perfectly fine. 🤷‍♂️

To double-check if it was just a one-time glitch, I went to another EVgo location. This is a station where my R1S used to charge without any issues about 6–7 months ago. But again, same problem—charging stopped within a few minutes with the same error message.

I’ve opened a service ticket and am currently waiting for a response, but I figured I’d post here in the meantime to see if anyone else has run into this. Is it an issue with EVgo’s newer stations, or is my R1S being finicky? Appreciate any advice or similar experiences you guys can share!"

Anyone here successfully using portable charger at home?
Anyone here successful in using portable charger at home? What is your set up (120V or 240V?) We don't have a 240V outlet in our garage currently.

Electrician is saying they will not install NEMA 240V (50amps or less) receptacle due to requiring GFCI breakers leading to tripping issues and prolonged charging times on these circuits can result in receptacle melting and compromising reliability and safe charging of vehicle.

Also how many miles can you get per hour on a 240V portable charger? We drive less than 30 miles a day."

My 🍯, and why Gen 1 Quad is the best Rivian ever
Ordered 1 month before pricehike (thanks A!), got the 7500 tax credit. 

Had to grab one of the last Compass yellow R1S and accept the full off road upgrades. 

Currently at 20k miles, never had any significant reliability issues. Service appointments were prompt for me in San Jose. 

Had a windshield replaced due to rock chips, and had to patch a flat myself. Otherwise the car kept on going and had been perfectly reliable.

Got EVsportsline running boards and it was fine.

Family and children love their yellow bus. 

I am one of the majority, the majority of very satisfied Rivian customers. No, I won’t be upgrading my car, not until another Compass yellow vehicle comes out. I really think Gen 1 quad from 23-24 have the highest quality and value.

My unpopular opinion? Gen 2 is the cost cutting generation and is not built as well. Almost every Rivian problem cars I know are Gen 2. "

Rivian Maps Are the Worst -Alternative?
Are there any reliable alternatives to the Rivian maps? They are the worst. They never show reliable traffic in my area and the traffic feature is even hard to see on the screen while driving. It has routed me several times to closed roads, traffic jams and roads under construction and won’t find alternative routes. I have to pull over and use google maps on my phone which is not safe and not a viable option. I had more reliable mapping on my 2011 ford fusion than on my R1S! Any alternatives and work around are much appreciated. Considering not keeping Connect+ because that seems like junk too that never works (the Alexa integration sucks btw). Hoping someone here may have a solution.

2022 R1T
I am looking at a 2022 R1T. My issue is a weird garage height at my home. Standards garage doors measure 78”…mine is 76.5”. I have heard an R1T might be my answer for a standard pickup that fits. Can the height of these be set and stay at a height that I don’t have to worry about hitting my ceiling every time I pull in???

Need a Reliable NEMA 10-30P to 14-50R Adapter for Charging Rivian R1S (Gen 2)
Hey everyone,

I’ve been using [this NEMA 10-30P to 14-50R adapter](https://a.co/d/iJ85wUL) to charge my 2025 Rivian R1S (Gen 2) from a dryer outlet. It was giving me around **18 miles of range per hour**, which was great for overnight charging.

It suddenly stopped working — and it seems like this happened **after I used it to charge a Rivian R1S Gen 1 (loaner vehicle)** for a few days. Not sure if that caused it, but it was working fine before that.

Looking for a **safe, well-built alternative** that works reliably with Rivian’s mobile charger. Bonus points for grounding protection and a reputable brand.

Any advice for getting pine needles out of the roof trim gaps?
Have tried compressed air with a Tornador gun, blasting water, picking out individually, running thin objects up and down the gap (think something like a credit card), but none of them really get more than 25% of the needles out. These ""solutions"" also tend to bunch all the needles up into a single spot, which makes me worry they'll end up blocking drainage even worse.

Anyone had any success getting these out with a reliable method? Is this trim piece easily removable and re-attachable without potentially breaking fragile clips?

How Rivian Can Transform From Industry's Worst to Reliability Leader

Just one owner’s opinion and a speculation how they got to this moment as I watch the frequency of service related posts seem to have been increasing rapidly the last few months. 

Rivian faces an unprecedented challenge in the automotive industry: being ranked dead last for reliability while simultaneously achieving the highest customer satisfaction scores. This contradiction, rather than being a corporate nightmare, actually represents Rivian's greatest opportunity. The 86% of customers who say they'd buy again despite experiencing reliability issues have essentially given the company a roadmap to redemption.

Unlike many automakers struggling with customer loyalty, Rivian has built something invaluable: genuine brand affection. Customers aren't just tolerating problems—they're actively advocating for the brand while waiting for improvements. This emotional connection provides the critical window needed to implement comprehensive changes without losing market confidence.

The company's direct-to-consumer model offers another significant advantage. While traditional automakers must work through dealer networks to improve service experiences, Rivian controls every customer touchpoint. This means changes can be implemented rapidly and consistently across the entire organization.

The Expensive Misstep: Premium Real Estate Over Practical Service

One of Rivian's most glaring strategic errors has been the allocation of enormous capital toward flashy sales centers in premium locations rather than practical service infrastructure. Founder and CEO RJ Scaringe's vision of sleek showrooms in high-rent districts like Manhattan's Meatpacking District, Beverly Hills, waterfront Laguna Beach, and downtown Seattle reflects a fundamental misunderstanding of what customers actually need.

These showcase locations, while visually impressive, consume millions in rent and buildout costs that could have funded dozens of service bays. A single Manhattan showroom's annual rent could operate three fully-equipped service centers in suburban markets where most customers actually live and drive their vehicles. The waterfront Laguna Beach location, with its premium coastal real estate costs, exemplifies this misplaced priority—stunning ocean views don't fix broken vehicles. The decision to prioritize brand image over customer utility suggests a founder more concerned with Silicon Valley aesthetics than automotive realities.

This misallocation becomes particularly painful when customers in markets like Los Angeles and Phoenix—areas with high Rivian ownership—face three to six-month service waits. The irony is stark: customers can admire a pristine R1T in a $50,000-per-month showroom overlooking the Pacific Ocean but can't get their own vehicle serviced for half a year.

RJ Scaringe's background provides crucial context for understanding Rivian's strategic missteps. Coming from a wealthy family that funded his early ventures, Scaringe has operated with a safety net that most entrepreneurs never experience. His father's success in business provided the initial capital and connections that launched Rivian, creating an environment where failure carried minimal personal consequences.

This privileged foundation, while enabling Rivian's ambitious vision, may have insulated Scaringe from the harsh realities of resource constraints that typically force startups toward practical decisions. When your family wealth can cover initial losses and prestigious investors line up based on vision rather than execution, the discipline of choosing service centers over showrooms becomes optional rather than essential.

The ""golden spoon"" mentality manifests in decisions that prioritize perception over performance. Expensive consultants, premium locations, and aspirational branding take precedence over the mundane but critical work of building reliable vehicles and accessible service networks. It's the difference between impressing investors at a Manhattan unveiling and satisfying a customer whose truck breaks down in suburban Phoenix.

When that golden spoon finally falls into the deep end—as reflected in Consumer Reports' devastating reliability rankings—the response often lacks the urgency that resource-constrained entrepreneurs develop by necessity. Someone who has never faced personal financial consequences from business failure may struggle to recognize when those consequences threaten the entire enterprise.

## Learning Curves and Life Lessons

Scaringe's journey with Rivian represents a crash course in lessons that many entrepreneurs learn through smaller failures earlier in their careers. The difference is that most people learn these lessons with smaller stakes—failed startups with a dozen employees, not public companies with billions in market capitalization and thousands of workers.

The expensive showroom strategy, the service infrastructure delays, and the quality control issues all point to decision-making patterns common among first-time leaders who haven't experienced real consequences from poor choices. These aren't character flaws but rather the predictable result of operating without the feedback mechanisms that typically teach entrepreneurial discipline.

The challenge for Rivian—and for Scaringe personally—is compressing this learning curve while managing a public company under intense scrutiny. Every mistake that might be forgiven in a private startup becomes a public relations crisis when you're competing with Tesla and traditional automakers for market credibility.

## Immediate Service Relief: The First Priority

The most pressing issue isn't actually the vehicles themselves—it's the service experience. When customers wait three to six months for routine appointments, even minor issues become major frustrations. Rivian needs to treat service infrastructure as emergency relief, not long-term planning.

The solution lies in aggressive expansion through partnerships rather than building everything in-house. Tesla's certified service partner program offers a proven model: work with established automotive service providers to dramatically increase capacity while maintaining quality standards. Rivian should simultaneously triple its mobile service fleet, handling routine maintenance and minor repairs at customers' homes and workplaces.

This approach requires abandoning the premium brand positioning that drove the expensive showroom strategy. Service centers in industrial parks with lower rent but better accessibility serve customers far better than architecturally stunning facilities in prestigious neighborhoods. The money currently locked into showroom leases—from Manhattan penthouses to Laguna Beach oceanfront properties—could fund comprehensive service expansion within months.

Real-time appointment booking with transparent wait times would immediately improve customer perception. When people can see exactly when service is available and choose from multiple options—express service, mobile visits, or comprehensive diagnostics—the anxiety of uncertainty disappears.

## Quality Engineering: Addressing Root Causes

While service improvements provide immediate relief, lasting change requires manufacturing excellence. Rivian's reliability score of 14 out of 100 isn't just a statistical problem—it represents systematic quality control issues that can be solved with proven methodologies.

The company should temporarily slow production to focus on quality over quantity. This counterintuitive approach allows for implementing additional quality checkpoints and standardizing processes that prevent defects rather than catching them after production. Every major automotive success story includes this inflection point where leadership chooses quality over short-term volume targets.

For Scaringe, this represents perhaps the most difficult lesson: that sustainable success requires patience and discipline that may conflict with investor expectations for rapid growth. The temptation to maintain production targets while fixing quality issues simultaneously has proven disastrous for the reliability rankings.

Establishing dedicated feedback loops between service centers and engineering teams creates real-time quality intelligence. When service technicians identify recurring problems, that information should immediately trigger design reviews and supplier discussions. This rapid iteration cycle can compress typical automotive quality improvement timelines from years to months.

## Technology as an Accelerator

Rivian's software-first approach provides unique advantages in reliability improvement. Over-the-air updates can prevent many software-related issues before they affect customers, while AI-powered diagnostics can predict failures before they occur. This predictive maintenance capability transforms the customer relationship from reactive problem-solving to proactive care.

Implementing comprehensive vehicle health monitoring allows Rivian to understand exactly how its vehicles perform in real-world conditions. This data goldmine enables targeted improvements and helps identify which components need redesign or alternative suppliers.

## Customer Experience Revolution

The path from worst to first requires more than fixing problems—it demands creating an experience that exceeds expectations. Rivian should implement a concierge service model where customers have dedicated service advisors who know their vehicle history and preferences. When problems do occur, immediate access to loaner vehicles ensures customers aren't stranded.

This customer-centric approach represents a fundamental shift from the brand-centric strategy that prioritized showroom aesthetics over service functionality. The lesson for Scaringe is that customer loyalty emerges from reliable execution, not impressive presentations.

Transparency becomes a competitive advantage when handled properly. Regular updates on reliability improvements, proactive communication about known issues, and detailed explanations of solutions build trust rather than highlighting problems. Tesla successfully used this approach during its own service struggles, turning transparency into customer advocacy.

## The Investment Framework

Success requires significant financial commitment across multiple areas, with a crucial reallocation away from premium retail locations toward functional service infrastructure. Service infrastructure demands immediate investment of approximately $500 million over 18 months to achieve meaningful capacity increases. Quality engineering improvements need $200 million for enhanced testing, validation, and supplier development programs.

The capital currently tied up in expensive showroom leases should be redirected toward these practical improvements. Every dollar spent on Manhattan retail space or Laguna Beach waterfront properties is a dollar not invested in service bays where customers actually need help.

Technology platforms for predictive maintenance and service excellence require $150 million, while comprehensive technician training and certification programs need $100 million. Customer experience enhancements, including communication improvements and compensation programs, should receive $50 million in dedicated funding.

## Measurable Transformation

The improvement journey needs clear milestones and accountability. Service appointment wait times should drop below two weeks within six months, while first-time fix rates should reach 85%. Customer satisfaction with service experiences should achieve 95% within twelve months.

Medium-term goals include improving the Consumer Reports reliability score to at least 40 out of 100 within two years, representing a dramatic but achievable improvement. Long-term success means achieving top-10 reliability rankings among all automotive brands within three years.

## Learning From Success Stories

Rivian can study proven transformation examples for guidance. Tesla evolved from service crisis to industry-leading mobile service capabilities, but notably did so without expensive showrooms in premium locations. Genesis achieved top reliability rankings within five years of launch by prioritizing quality over rapid expansion. Lexus built its reputation on service excellence that consistently ranks among the best in any industry.

Each success story shares common elements: leadership commitment to quality over short-term metrics, significant investment in infrastructure and training, and treating customer feedback as product development intelligence rather than complaints to manage. None prioritized prestigious retail locations over functional service capabilities.

## The Competitive Advantage Waiting to Be Claimed

Rivian's current crisis contains the seeds of unprecedented competitive advantage. No automotive startup has ever had such high customer loyalty while addressing fundamental reliability issues. This unique position allows for implementing changes that might otherwise face customer resistance.

The company's sustainability mission and innovative technology create emotional connections that traditional automakers struggle to achieve. When reliability matches this emotional appeal, Rivian could establish customer loyalty levels that transcend typical automotive relationships.

Transformation from worst to first requires treating this crisis as the opportunity it actually represents. Rather than defensive damage control, Rivian should embrace aggressive improvement as a core competitive strategy. The roadmap is clear: immediate service relief, systematic quality improvement, technology-enabled excellence, and customer experience revolution.

For Scaringe personally, this represents a defining moment in his leadership evolution. The lessons learned from Rivian's struggles—prioritizing substance over style, customer needs over brand aesthetics, and operational excellence over growth metrics—will determine whether he emerges as a mature leader capable of building lasting value.

Success demands sustained commitment from leadership, significant financial investment, and cultural change throughout the organization. However, the combination of customer loyalty, direct sales control, and technology capabilities provides advantages that established automakers would struggle to replicate.

Rivian stands at a crossroads where the right decisions and investments could create one of the most remarkable turnaround stories in automotive history. The customers are ready, the technology exists, and the pathway is proven. Now it's about execution, accountability, and transforming the industry's worst reliability ranking into its greatest competitive differentiator.

The foundation of customer loyalty already exists—Rivian just needs to build the reliability and service excellence that customer devotion deserves. Most importantly, it needs leadership that has learned to distinguish between what looks impressive and what actually works."

2026 Models...my biggest hope is not NACS or Stereo...
After researching a ton and having done a couple test drives, I'm getting closer to choosing an R1S over the Gravity when I lease a new vehicle this September.

My biggest hope with the new models is that they greatly improve the QC checks before delivery. I simply cannot believe how many issues I see on these $100K cars every day, with many within days/months of receiving.

Before people start yelling that only people with issues post, I will point out:

\-Even the various influencers, who Rivian knows will post reviews, get cars that have immediate issues. I mean, if you can't get Out of Spec a car that is doesn't have immediate noticeable issues (like being out of alignment)...well, the head of QC needs to do something different for a living.

\-I also have been trying to find stats on ""service request/issues in first year of ownership"" and it seems that nobody releases these stats. Of course, Consumer Reports has Rivian dead last in ""Reliability Ratings"" even though it tests high on satisfaction. I mean, that is survey-based but it's probably the closest thing to measurable data we can get publicly. (Let me know if there are others.)

I'm just very nervous that if I do a 2 year lease, I'll be dealing with stupid issues for half of the lease period.

I'm not sure of my strategy, but one reason I think I'll lean towards the 2026 model is that I'm hoping it is run through a new & improved QC system of checks before they deliver. I saw on OOS's factory tour they mentioned QC improvements coming up...

Let me know thoughts (or even better, data)...but buying a $100k car should not be such a gamble that I keep saying ""I hope I get a good one."" lol"

R2- SC Expansion questions
I am trying to gauge the lead times on new service centers. Specifically, from initial announcement to when they actually open. One year? I am looking the map and see nothing planned for Louisiana, MS, ALA. This seems like it may limit the scope of R2 sales through the Gulf Coast. With that being said I do see both the R1S and R1T here! Is there any talk that existing VW service centers will be able to add Rivian service? I am a reservation holder and investor and I will begrudgingly make the drive from NOLA to Houston as needed. However, I am hoping that is only for a year so. Also, going east for beach and bike trips seems risky given the vast lack of service until you hit deep into Florida.

I was looking at getting the RS but it is a tad long to park on the street in NOLA. R2 will be perfect. In chatting with sales they kept saying no concrete plans for service center but they ""heard"" one would come. I am not sure how reliable that is from sales but I am interested."

Tell me why I should NOT buy a R1S
My family and I are currently in the market for a 3 row SUV and we're interested in exploring options. My wife and I are already leaning towards he R1S because we like the brand theme and the features it has.

 Currently considering the R1S tri motor. Picked this over the dual motor since we wanted the extra options... and the Slate Sky only comes with the tri-motor packages and above. Im about a half hour away from the nearest service center, with the next one about 45 minutes away in the opposite direction. 

  
There are some concerns I have o the R1S and I want to know what the community thinks of the car in detail and wether or not you'd suggest/convince someone looking for a car with these criteria:

  
1. 3-Row with the 3rd row being able to comfortable sit someone 6' tall as reference height

2. Spacious cargo capacity for family items (stroller + cooler) maybe even consider carry ons for long road trips 

3. Range - large battery pack/range numbers were what led me to rule out the EV9s/Vistiqs, Id like to be able to go long stretches of drives without needing to make a stop, or at least I can make stops/explore areas that don't have charging stations and not have range anxiety.

\----

  
Other cars considered:

  
1. Volvo EX90 - Going to test drive it today. Apparently, ti has more of a focus on luxury/comfort for everyday use. Strong + in the sound department but the big drawbacks I find for it is the 3rd row not being amazing and unfortunately, I really do need to have functional 3rd row. 

2. Lexus 700h - More of the ""safety pick"" hoping that the reputation of reliability still stands this day for Lexus models especially at this price point.

Far 3. Lucid Gravity - Ticks a lot of good boxes for me, I just wish I didn't have to wait 6-9 months to get it....

  
\----

  
Some questions I have for the R1S. 

**Offroad Package**  
I plan to get the offroad package purely for the 20"" wheels... so that eventually I can switch for it to 20"" all season tires so I can get better ride comfort ... and for better options/price. I personally also like the idea of the additional underbody protection.. 

I plan to take the car to parks/campgrounds etc, but maybe like 5-8 times a year? Havent decided yet if Im wiling to take a 6 figure car out off roading yet. 

  
**How bad is the sound system really?**

Im reading a lot of owners are frustrated about the quality of the in-house audio. Is it really that bad? Or is it coming from the expectation that because this is a $100k+ car, that it should be really good? Can the problem be fixed via software or is this also a hardware-related issue? 

  
**High Mileage Maintenance and Serviceability**

I know no vehicle is BIFL, but I am coming into this with the intention of wanting to own this, and be able to drive it, for at least 10 years. Our family recent cars was a Mazda 6, CRV, and a Equinox, non of us had ever experienced owning a vehicle that was even close to over $30,000, so moving into a vehicle that is more than 3x the cost of what we're used to, a lot of these experience are going to feel expensive.

How has Rivian service been to you as customers and were they able to take care of your vehicles at reasonable time frames? Whats the cost of repair once out of warranty for big items like the air suspension, motor, battery packs? 

I read ""Air Suspension"" and I already am wondering how troublesome would this be to replace? 

  
\-----

  
Overall, I love the idea of the R1S, I love the brand and what its moving to. Given my needs for a vehicle, does the R1S make sense or should I consider another vehicle instead?

Seriously Second-Guessing My Lease—Would Love Input from Long-Term Owners
Hey everyone—  
I’m at the final stage before taking delivery of my Rivian (R1T lease), and I’m suddenly getting some serious cold feet. I’ve been excited about this for a month or so, but now that it’s real, I’m hesitating—and I could really use some honest feedback from owners who’ve lived with the truck day to day.

Here’s some context:

* I currently drive a 2022 Toyota Tundra (\~59k miles), which I love. I've got great positive equity in it, super reliable, and fits my needs well (except for the horrible mpg).
* I *can* afford the Rivian lease pretty cleanly, but the number still gives me pause when I think about long-term value.
* I live in a condo with an assigned parking spot **but no home charging**. I’m moving a couple times over 3-6 months and expect to have better charging access eventually—but not yet.
* I’m seeing some horror stories here about software glitches, service delays, inconsistent charging behavior, etc., and I’m starting to wonder: **am I overestimating how easy this transition will be?**
* There are also little Tundra things I’ve grown used to—rear sliding window, hard buttons, Car Play (please don't shoot), smart key system—that I’m now realizing might be more important to me than I thought.

I’m *not* trying to bash Rivian—I think it’s an amazing company and product. But I’ve seen a few posts from folks who were in love early on, only to realize later it didn’t fully fit their lifestyle, and I just want to make sure I’m going in eyes wide open.

If you made a similar switch (especially from a gas truck to Rivian), I’d love to hear:

* What surprised you the most—good or bad?
* How has living without home charging impacted you?
* Do you ever regret the tradeoff from a traditional truck to the R1T?

Appreciate any wisdom you’re willing to share. Just trying to make the most informed call I can.

Edit to add: my condo does have ChargePoint coming soon (in a couple weeks) but zero details so far. 3-4 EVs will share 2 chargers so not clear how that will work. "

starlink mini doesn’t work through roof glass
I’m using a Gen 2 Rivian R1S. I’ve tested Starlink from inside the vehicle in various positions (panoramic roof, rear glass, etc.). No part of the roof glass allows Starlink to lock satellites – it just stays stuck on “trying to locate satellites,” even with perfect sky view and a stationary car. I’m not sure if Rivian added a metallic layer or special coating to the glass, but for those considering using Starlink from inside the vehicle – it’s a complete no-go. Outside mounting is the only reliable method."

But can we talk about the turn signals? Canceling a signal is something we all do constantly, and in the Rivian it’s weirdly hard. It’s way too easy to overshoot and accidentally signal the opposite direction, then have to try again—while looking totally unhinged to everyone around you.

A recent update added auto-off for lane changes, but it’s sluggish—often staying on a second or two after I’ve completed the lane change. Worse, it only works about 80% of the time, so I’m always nervously waiting to see if it worked.

Why didn’t they just use a standard mechanical stalk like basically every car made in the last 80 years? It was rock-solid, intuitive, and reliably canceled after turns. Is this some cost-saving thing?

Maybe some people adjust over time, but months in, I still think the signals are awful.

Anyone else feel this way? Is it better in Gen 2? Has Rivian acknowledged this and said they’ll improve it?"

Switched from Tesla X to R1S -- Detailed comparison
I still have a 2020 Tesla Model X LR and just added a 2025 R1S Standard.  When I was considering the R1S, I searched but did not find a comprehensive and objective comparison of the two vehicles.  For Tesla MX owners considering switching, here are my thoughts.  First, some background to help you contextualize my experience:

**TL;DR:** Software experience is far better for Tesla.  Hardware / build quality is far better for Rivian. For my near-term needs, the Tesla Model X is better.  But over time, the R1S's larger size will be the deciding factor and I'll have to make do with the Rivian's shortcomings.

**Background: Experienced Tesla owner, new R1S owner.**

Owned Model X for 5 years as the daily driver so I know it extremely well.  I hate how many problems my Tesla has had -- for example, my HV battery has been replaced 3 times (yes, THREE times). 

Owned the R1S for 2 months so I don't profess to be a R1S expert. But it is my exclusive daily driver.  I am hoping to I find all the quirks before taking it out for summer road trips.

  
**My use case: Full-size 3-row EV as kid hauler.**

I have 3 young kids. Must-haves for a new car were 1) a full-size, usable third row as the kids grow, and 2) an electric vehicle since I have a home charger.  Rarely used the MX third row given how tight it is; main usage was to separate the kids and minimize fighting. Nice-to-have was to have large hauling capacity, in order to move kids stuff and large items for home/business needs.

Also considered the Lexus TX plug-in, Kia EV9, Audi Q7 e-tron, VW Buzz, and gas minivans (primarily Sienna, Odyssey, and Carnival). Not the focus of this post, but happy to share my thoughts on these alternatives if you have a similar use 



Now, a detailed comparison of the two vehicles.

**DRIVING EXPERIENCE**

* **Manned driving experience: R1S >MX**. Good steering wheel weight. Responsive handling and adjustable drive modes (snow, sand). Acceleration and regenerative braking are pretty similar for both vehicles. Road noise is far lower in the R1S, so I don't need to blast the music how I did in the MX.
* **Self-driving experience: MX > R1S all around, but R1S will not nag you to death.** R1S's self-driving (Highway Assist) only works on the highway and is far limited to Tesla's autopilot.  The latter will switch lanes on its own, allows speed/aggressiveness adjustments, and works when you are not on the highway.  That said, Tesla autopilot nags incessantly and requires you to regularly jiggle the steering wheel, even when you are on a completely straight stretch of highway for miles and miles.  Rivian Highway Assist nags far less but is also less accurate -- it disengaged for a section of highway that was being repaved with poorly visible lane lines.

**CONTROLS**

* **Physical controls: MX > R1S.** The Tesla buttons and scroll wheels were customizable and had various functions. The R1S right buttons are only used to adjust speed on Highway Assist; the rest of the time, they do absolutely nothing.  
* **Touchscreen controls: R1S is slightly better than MX.** Rivian's menus are shallower with easy access to most of the things you need, so fewer clicks needed. Tesla touchscreen menus are cumbersome to navigate.

**PHYSICAL QUALITIES**

* **Storage capacity: R1S > MX.**  R1S wins hands down with huge front trunk, subfloor trunk storage, usable third row, roof racks instead of the MX's gull wings. Tie down latches in the trunk make it incredibly functional. Main downside for R1S is the lack of glove box
* **Heating/cooling: R1S > MX.**  Front seats for R1S are both heated and cooled, vs. MX are only heated. Third row for R1S also has heated seats, but MX doesn't.
* **Lighting: R1S > MX.** R1S has adaptive headlights to spare oncoming traffic from high beams. Guide lights and accent lighting are nice but more for show than anything useful.
* **Wipers: R1S > MX.** Rivian's automatic wiper sensing works well.  While MX offers this option, I keep it on at all times and the wipers do not reliably engage, even in heavy rain. R1S also has a rear wiper vs. MX did not.
* **Doors: MX > R1S.**  Closing the R1S doors requires a heavy push and cannot be actuated The kids end up not shutting the door with enough force \~10% of the time, which means I need to close it -- very inconvenient during hectic school drop off.  Now I tell them to just slam the door, which has worked well so far.  MX was ideal for small kids since the wing doors could be closed with a button push.
* **Seats: R1S > MX.** R1S has high-quality durable material that withstand the kids jumping and stepping without issue.  MX has visible scuffs and scrapes on the seats, which are a thinner material.

**TECHNOLOGY**

* **GPS & Navigation: MX > R1S.** Traffic is clearly visible on Tesla navigation but is sporadic for Rivian.  The highway can be horribly backed up and Rivian navigation won't show any red at all.  Hard to proactively avoid traffic when it isn't reliably visible on my R1S.
* **Cameras: R1S is far superior, particularly 360 degree view.** 
* **Call quality: R1S > MX.**  In the MX, it is hard for people to hear me given the excessive road noise, especially while on the highway. No similar issues for the R1S.  People can hear me clearly and have not raised mentioned call quality as an issue (unlike when I speak in the MX).
* **Voice control: MX > R1S, but I admit to being biased against Alexa.** R1S voice controls via Alexa work fine but it is annoying to have to summon ""Alexa"" every time.  MX has a dedicated button to trigger voice control, which I much prefer.
* **Entertainment: MX > R1S.**  Kids like to play the Tesla arcade games when we are killing time.  Rivian only has YouTube and audio streaming services so it works well enough but is less of a draw for the kids.

My highest weighted items are GPS/navigation, call quality, and capacity. In general, Tesla has a more refined software experience, particularly with navigation. But the better Tesla software is moot if I can't fit the whole family, diapers, bikes, and sports gear, so I will ultimately need to accept Rivian's shortcomings to get more space for the family.

Lastly, if you want to use my referral code, I pledge to pass on the referee credit to you ($500 value as of writing). Please DM me; I won't post my referral code publicly. When I got my R1S, I used another Redditor's referral code because they had several posts stating they would pass on the full credit. However, they only passed on half the credit ($250). While I appreciate them for passing on anything, I was misled by what they had publicly promised. So, my turn to help build the Rivian community that I hope for:  I pledge to pass on the credit to you -- and if I don't, I urge you to name and shame me.  "

Rivian R2 versus Volvo XC60
Debating getting a Volvo XC60 now versus waiting for the R2... I know this is a little apples to oranges as it's hybrid versus electric but trying to weigh the flexibility and established track record of the XC60 with the potential of the Rivian (people seem to LOVE their R1s, but reliability seems mixed and would be getting the first model year of the R2). Have a 7-seater already so looking at a 5-seater for going around town. Any strong arguments for one or the other?"

Incident can and Road cam failed us - anyone else?
Gen1 R1S with 2TB drive for road cam.

Incident occurred in a parking lot.  I was slowly backing out of my spot.  At about 75% clear from my parking spot, I noticed a vehicle across the aisle (behind me, 1 spot over) put their car in reverse and started moving (without looking or hesitation.  I immediate stop our R1S and lay on the (wimpy) horn, but that didn’t prevent the other vehicle from continuing to back up.  Their vehicle scraped/rubbed along our passenger side rear corner, damaging the bumper, quarter panel, and probably the tailgate.  

Despite mashing the horn and the car being nudged for a few seconds (the other driver didn’t stop on initial impact), the Incident camera didn’t capture the accident.  It started rolling after I had gotten out of the R1S to initially inspect the damage.  Additionally, that is when the road cam also has footage starting from.  Every other trip today had the road cam footage start from when I placed the vehicle in gear.

Really frustrating as this would have been a slam dunk on fault with the footage.  Anyone else have this problem with camera recording?  I can “understand” the road cam not being reliable, but I’m truly disappointed the incident cam didn’t trigger on my initial horn use."

The Unluckiest EV owner in the World.
Just wanted to share with the world my crazy and non representative EV truck experience of the last 2.5 years. 

In December 2022 I took delivery of a R1T Quad in Rivian blue. It was my dream car, I got the early order pricing and I was thrilled with it. 

It was not my first EV, I came from an early build Model Y but it was a huge upgrade. It reminded me of my old blue Tacoma but offering the performance, tech, and comfort that I never thought I could afford. 

Sadly it kept going into service. Roughly every 2-3 months it would spend between 11-23 days in service at a time. Everything from rattles, squeaks, leaking hydraulics, leaking air suspension, replacing rear both drive units, etc. Despite all this I stuck with it, it met my States requirements as a lemon in my first year of ownership but I just toughed it out. My fiancée was running out of patience with my truck as every service trip required me driving over an hour one way just to drive an enterprise rental for two weeks. 

The final straw came as I got to take a once in a lifetime month long road trip across the West. I drove from the East coast to Colorado and all over Utah. I got to do some amazing off roading, camping, and hiking. Sadly, during that trip I noticed a bad musty smell. I figured it might be the evaporator coils, something many Tesla owners are familiar with. Not a big deal but annoying. The smell kept getting worse though. Finally on a stop where I pulled out the floor mats to clean them I noticed the drivers floor was soaked and probably had mold growing. The AC was draining into the cabin. The mold was especially concerning because I am allergic to indoor molds, but at least I figured out why I was sick for most of the trip. I tried to get the truck into the Denver service center and then the Colorado Springs service center. Colorado Springs was able to get me in but they said it would likely take 14 days to repair because they would have to replace the entire heater core along with removing most of the carpeting and sanitizing underneath it. I decided at that point to return back to the East coast, have my regular service center fix it and then try and continue the second half of the trip. 

When I was about 400 miles away from home at a charging stop in Ohio I happened to notice my rear tire treads seemed low, which was weird because I put fresh tires in before I left on the trip. Upon inspection I found both rear tires treads were completely worn down to the metal cords on the inner part of both tires. 

I decided to slightly air down the tires and basically try to limp home at 50 mph. I made it about 70 miles from home when one of those tires failed and I had the truck towed to Rivian from the side of the highway. I have a full size spare but the other tire was close to failure as well. This was the straw that broke the camels back. The truck recently had an alignment done, I had done off roading but nothing that should result in a severe misalignment to cause this. Rivian had replaced both rear drive units before I left on the trip but I am not sure if the tire exploding was related to that. What troubled me more was that if I hadn’t had glanced at my rear tires I would have never known there was a problem. The tire could have exploded with me going full speed down the highway. There was no steering wheel shake or other tell. 

At that point I asked Rivian to buy the truck back. It kicked off a long process that went back forth but finally we came to an agreement despite the truck being too old for the formal lemon process. 

I decided I still wanted an EV truck. I was not going to get a Cybertruck because my fiancée would leave me and I did not want all the negative attention, plus at the time they were over $100k. I decided to go with a Ford Lightning because it was a simpler suspension set up, and I just figured it would be more reliable and easier to access service. I did the dealership dance and got a killer deal. I drove the Lightning for about few days and then noticed after dropping off some pavers and mulch for my Mom that the front of the roof between the windshield and the moon roof had deep scratches and dents. I figured out immediately this damage must’ve come from the car carrier. I picked up the truck at night and despite using a two page delivery checklist from the Lightning forums I missed the damage. The dealer did offer to fix it in their body shop for free. I was annoyed, I did not want a brand new truck that had body work off the bat but they weren’t going to take it back. I brought it in for them to repair. 

Two weeks into that repair I got a notification in the Ford App that were was a battery/powertrain malfunction. I hoped this was just a glitch or a result of the dealer having to disable the HV system while doing body work. Sadly their service department then confirmed it was indeed a bad battery module. They would have to drop the pack and replace the module. I took that as a sign and requested a buyback. Ford initially refused but I sent a frustrated email to the Ford CEOs public email about the dealer and the entire experience. To Fords credit a member of the executive office reached out to me and took over the buy back case personally. She got it done and that was that with the Lightning. 

At this point I made a decision that many would say is crazy. I went back to Rivian. I just loved the brand and there is truly nothing like the truck. I knew my truck was a lemon and hoped lightning would not strike twice. I ended up leasing a Tri Max R1T in Rivian Blue. Now 5 months into ownership its getting ready for its second service trip. Alignment problems, rattles, sound system rattles/resonance. 

I still have to drive over an hour but at least this time I got a loaner. An early VIN R1T. Worked flawlessly for the 11 days I had it…

I truly do not think my experience is representative but maybe the universe is telling me I shouldn’t drive an EV truck. "

Schedule Charging Bug
I plugged my R1S in this evening for the first time in a week (or more?) and walked away. For whatever reason I happened to glance at the charger and noticed that it was pulsing as if it was charging. That’s odd, since it was 8:30pm and the car is set to only charge 12am-3pm during my off peak hours. I had to hit “stop charging” after a couple minutes, it clearly wasn’t stopping on its own. Anyone had this happen?

Running 2025.14.01 and I’d done a full hard reset earlier today. Earlier in the day my steering wheel didn’t adjust to my saved settings, so figured I should do one. Usually do a hard reset after each update but had forgotten. Pretty unimpressed with update reliability at this point. "

A few weeks ago I posted about buying a rivian and I I decided to go forward and I have a few questions about the options
Thank you everyone for your earlier responses. I have decided to move forward with the rivian truck and I had a few questions about some of the options and choices I had and was hoping I could get some feedback 

1. Is the electric cover more reliable now? I know early on they had lots of issues with it...

2. How well does the self-driving system work? I have used the one in Tesla and it's quite good and I was wondering where rivian was with their technology...

3. Are there any options that are must-haves or must avoids? 

Any real world feedback on these would be great to hear...

Why I chose a 2025 Gen2 R1S over the Volvo EX90
I took delivery of my 2025 R1S Trimotor yesterday and figured I’d share my thinking on buying this car. 

I narrowed this down to two cars: Volvo EX90 and the R1S. First I’ll say: my experience driving the EX90 was delightful. I have zero complaints about it. I know there’s endless reports of reliability issues with it, but I’ve also seen a fair share of these on Rivian. To me these issues washed out and I accepted I was buying an expensive but immature product.

I won’t trash the EX90, it’s really a phenomenal vehicle but I’ll share what won me over to the R1S.

1. RJ. I’ve admired RJ for a long time. I love what he stands for and how he represents the company and wanted to support him. I think founder’s personality permeates throughout the company and my experience so far has corroborated that.

2. The software. I’m one those that wants CarPlay in the R1S and it really held me back in the past from buying this car. Rivian has a level of product coherence with the software / hardware that you just don’t see on other non-Tesla cars and is good enough to overcome some of the gaps that come from no CarPlay. I also enjoyed the latest highway assist features. I can’t wait for them to extend this beyond the highway. 

3. The design and brand. Both the exterior and the interior of the R1s have tremendous character and connective tissue with the brand. I feel something from Rivian when I see their cars and experience their design language, whereas Volvo and others are striving for a level of sterility that’s way too close to boring. Genuinely this stuff makes me want to work for them.

4. Space. The R1S cargo capacity is massive compared to others in a similar category.

Obviously this post is full of peak honeymoon positivity and I know the ownership experience of these cars is anything but that. But that doesn’t detract from these areas that Rivian should continue to invest in."

Buying R1T used - suggestions which?  And where?  Carvana?
Hey all - I am leaning toward the R1T over the lighting for my first EV truck and am likely buying used.

Anyone have suggestions which year and trim/battery mix makes best sense for value and quality?

I heard something about Gen 2 starting in 2024 but I know very little what that means in terms of improved features.  

Also, any suggested better sources for most reliable used R1T?  I live in the Boston area and am not finding much via dealers or private sales so wondering what others experience was using Carvana?  Or are there other good sources for used R1T's that anyone here can suggest?

Thx for advice on both questions - which used RIT year is best value and where is best source for find used options?

Valet mode?
I'm a former Tesla owner and one feature (besides the ability to read and send texts) is valet mode.  That is the ability to limit access to the frunk, map activity (such as home address) and the speed at which the vehicle can be operated at.  Does anyone know if that is anywhere on the roadmap for updates?  I've had my vehicle 6 weeks and am still trying to identify reliable sources of information."

Reflecting on one week of ownership
I took delivery of my new Tri-Motor Gen 2 R1S about a week ago, and I’ll admit—I was a little nervous. Spending over $100K on a vehicle you’ve seen Reddit threads warning about laggy infotainment and odd wind noise naturally raises some questions.

But so far, none of those concerns have come true. The infotainment system is fantastic—I actually like it *more* than Tesla’s—and I’ve never experienced any lag. On the freeway, it’s remarkably quieter than my previous Model Y, and the overall build quality feels top-notch.

I’ve also been impressed by the range estimator’s accuracy. My Tesla would often drop from “162 miles remaining” to “157” after just a couple of miles; the Rivian’s numbers are much more reliable.

This morning, I drove to a trailhead for a run and tried out off-road mode. The ground clearance is outstanding, and my dog fits comfortably in the back even with the third row up.

All in all, I’m extremely pleased with this purchase—kudos to the Rivian team! 

If you’re on the fence or have any questions, feel free to DM me."

Seattle to Zion Trip Summary
This is our first road trip with the 2025 Rivian R1S Tri-Max. It was fun to drive, but we had a few terrifying moments.

We set out from Seattle, WA, driving along I-90, I-82, I-84, and I-15. Charging was generally manageable; however, we didn't follow the recommended stops on the Rivian map, as I opted for the Tesla charging plan. This led us to rely solely on Tesla Super Chargers. Naturally, we took a risk twice each way, arriving with just 35 miles of range remaining. Along our route, we encountered only one Rivian Adventure charging station, while several hotels we visited offered Noodoe charging stations.

The entire trip covered 2,500 miles and cost us $367.43, after subtracting $102.09 from six months of free Rivian Adventure Network. The average range was 1.91 mi/kWh.

The trip mileage estimation is impressively accurate as it takes into account both the uphills and downhills, ensuring a reliable experience!

I made a mistake while we were in Nephi, UT. When we arrived at the Tesla charging station, our attempt to charge failed to initiate. I then moved to another charging post, only to discover its label didn't correspond with what the Tesla app indicated. After half an hour of trying various chargers, I remained unaware of another Tesla charging station located just behind Cody's restaurant, until someone informed me about the faster chargers at the back of the building.

Let's now turn to some frightening experiences. First, we truly appreciate the vehicle and its advanced technologies. Throughout our journey, we utilized the Highway Assist feature whenever possible, which made long-distance driving significantly more enjoyable and relaxing. However, on our way back along I-15, we encountered road work that narrowed the lanes. While the R1S successfully remained within its lane as it adjusted to the narrower area, it appeared that the R1S was on the verge of colliding with to a car right next to us. In an effort to correct our trajectory, I made a slight adjustment to the steering wheel. Unfortunately, the Highway Assist and Lane Keep Assist reacted too aggressively, resulting in the car to start fishtail. Experiencing fishtailing at high speeds on the highway was terrifying, but fortunately, no other vehicles were in close proximity. After this incident, I opted to disable the Lane Keep Assist feature.

When using Highway Assist, I sometimes found myself wanting it to be smarter about keeping a safe distance from semi-trucks rather than just remaining centered in the lane, especially around wider load trucks. Now, we have to disengage the Highway Assist feature each time we pass a semi-truck.

I have one more exciting thing to share! I’ve got a brand new NACS adapter that I’d love to give away. If you use my referral code to place your order, you can snag it! If you're nearby, we can easily set up a time for you to pick it up once we've both received our rewards. If not, no worries at all! I can ship it to you for a flat fee of just $10 once Rivian applies the rewards. PM me.

Hoping to get your advice, I love the idea of an R1 S, but every time I look into them on a deeper level, I see a bunch of quality complaints and that Rivian has a low reliability rating and I can’t bring myself to spend 90k+ on one. Is it really that bad? "

My Ultimate Rivian R1S Car Camping Guide
As an adventure-focused brand, we know many Rivian owners are campers, overlanders, explorers, or somewhere in between. Camping in an EV just makes sense—with ample onboard power and built-in HVAC, you get all-weather comfort without the usual hassle. It might take some trial and error to dial in the perfect setup, but here’s my guide to transforming your Rivian R1S into a capable, go-anywhere camping rig. Just a quick note: this isn’t a sponsored post. No brand paid me, and no one sent me free gear. I personally purchased every single item listed in this guide.

2022 R1T Quad Motor OffRoad package on the way, Non-Tesla network road trip recommendations?
If all works out, I'm turning my M3 into a 2022 R1T Quad with the off road package this week. I've done an obsessive amount of research, but my main question now revolves around charging. I live in the North Bay and I'm going to be taking a road trip down to Joshua Tree next month. 

I know I can charge at Superchargers with the adapter now, which is one of the reasons it was easier to make the switch, but I'm also curious which non-Tesla networks other than RAN--which don't seem to be on my route--are most reliable (EA, EvGo, etc) so I have options since, having been a Tesla owner, I don't want to take up two charging spots if I can avoid it. Or, heaven forbid, I get to a Supercharger and there aren't two adjacent slots available. 

Anyone else in the North Bay make this road trip and have some recommendations? 

(Also, can I say how much of a deal the 2022 R1Ts quads are compared to a comparably specced new R1T?!)

(Also also, if anyone has some good off roading / off the beaten path exploration recommendations around Joshua Tree, I'm all ears!)

Tesla Charger -> Rivian Converter for Level 2?
I'm replacing a Model 3 with an R1S and I already have the Level 2 Tesla charger installed in my garage. I also ordered the NACS Adapter from Rivian, but only realized after ordering that it's Level 3 Charging only.

My Rivian Guide gave me some warnings about third-party converters and suggested I buy a Rivian home charger to replace my current one, which is $800 plus probably another $500 in electrical labor.

I know that's probably a liability thing, but does anyone have experiences (good or bad) with which adapters (if any) are safe and reliable to convert L2 charging?"

R1S vs TX vs X7
Hello! My wife and I are looking at getting the R1S Dual with all the options except for the Max battery to replace her Sienna.  We currently have a (refundable) deposit on a Lexus TX 500h Luxury and are also considering the BMW X7.  Each of these cars has some features that the others lack, so I've come here for advice!  Below are some things we like and don't like about each and I'd love to hear your thoughts.  My wife was initially resistant to electric cars because of all the issues that we've seen.  While Rivian seems somewhat better, I've still read numerous posts on here about wait times for repairs.  With that said, a lot of them seem to be in CA (we're located in Maryland, about an hour from the newly opened Glen Burnie location).  I'd like to also hear your thoughts on reliability and having things repaired.  Paying ~$100k for a car that sits in the shop for weeks is unacceptable to me (as I'm sure it is to others as well).

Lexus Pros
- the most affordable ~$80k
- it's a toyota/lexus, that speaks volumes to longevity and reliability
- very spacious (my oldest is in a lot of sports, requiring hauling around kids and gear for him and his sister)
- wireless android auto
- heads up display
- digital rearview mirror
- captains chairs
- ventilated rear seats
- power folding and reclining third row
- manual window shades
- self parking features 

Lexus Cons
- the seats are rather uncomfortable with the side bolsters
- it feels like a toyota, lacking much refinement on the interior
- not as much space as the Rivian when factoring the frunk
- the exterior is not very exciting, it looks like a highlander
- still have normal maintenance of a gas powered vehicle
- generally kind of boring
- no soft close doors

Reliability Issues
My first grader brought home some schoolwork today... He’s totally obsessed with our Rivian (which has been flawless for us), but judging by his latest writing project, it looks like Rivian’s reliability image might need a little work when it comes to the 7-year-old demographic!"

Rivian Firewall Ports
I've noticed that the rivian app connects much more reliably to the vehicle (especially live cam) when it's not on wifi and is going over LTE, which seems counter-intuitive. I was wondering if anyone knows if there are any ports I should be forwarding in my router's firewall to help things out. Or maybe there's some other gotcha, but I am assuming it's most likely a NAT/FW issue since LTE is great, and my home network seems otherwise fine (good signal, works flawlessly on half a dozen devices)"

Road Trip Report: Santa Cruz to Lake Tahoe
My wife, my dog and I took our first tahoe trip last weekend. I've done this trip plenty of times in my wrangler, and really wanted to do a good comparison.  Attached pics to show how it was packed.  I've uploaded plenty of dog picks for the karma.

**tldr**: i loved it. i loaded the vehicle with my brick of a snowboard bag on the roof just like i would have on the jeep and managed a respectable 1.94 mi/kwh. More efficient than what i had been driving. Super quiet. Comfortable. Tons of room.  the snowboarding was great. 

our vehicle: 2025 R1S tri max with offroad pack. oem tires on 20"" rims. 

  
i've got RAN charging for free until august. i made sure to charge only at RAN chargers on the way up, and back. The Truckee charger was my favorite.  Placerville is not quite as quaint as stopping in the historic downtown. Manteca is close enough to tantalize you with bass pro shops outdoor world, but it's so far that you don't actually have time to walk there and back in 20 minutes. 

At the end of the day, they were all fast enough, and they were reporting that i would have been charged 0.49kwh. i like free better.

My hotel ended up having some destination chargers. there were a dozen tesla chargers and 3 j1772 chargers. This was also a free perk just provided by the hotel. all my transportation ended up being free!  

on saturday night there was stiff competition for chargers. There was one tesla still available. i couldn't plug in. i've made a note to get a tesla to j1772 adapter for future trips. luckilly, i have a max pack. having charged to 80% the night before let me not worry about charging saturday night. that was plenty for a couple days of exploring around the lake.

I did some hands free driving. I find it nice for when i need to open a bottle of water or  a granola bar or something. Otherwise i find that i get bored after sitting there for a few minutes and want to do something to occupy me... driving seems fun compared to just staring mostly out the front window.

i do really like the adaptive cruise control.

i loved having tons of room. I didn't have to plan an elaborate tetris maneuver to get all our stuff in. We had easy access to the stuff we needed. This was a major pain point in my jeep. this was a big reason why i made the switch, and i love it.

my wife and I think the sound system sounds great. i guess, in spite of us both being musicians and having been in bands... we are not audiophiles. again, going back to jeep comparisons, we are used to baaaad audio. We both really appreciate how quiet the cabin is. even the off road tires sound nice and soothing. 

the bad:

The defog button. WTF is this supposed to do? 

it seems like if you push it, you are going to HAVE to also open the environmental panel and turn auto off and manually adjust the fan speed to be something that isn't going to turn your car into a convection oven.  why have a convenience button that doesn't work unless you push a whole bunch of other buttons?

what does work the way i expect is to just open the environmental control panel and tap the windscreen blower.  you get normal air blowing over the window. the fog goes away. the heating doesn't run amok.

my wife really wishes there was a physical volume control for the passenger. She feels like, as the passenger, she doesn't like interacting with the screen in case the driver needs to do or see something on the screen. Like, maybe i'm looking at the nav and don't want a volume slider popping up right where i'm looking or something. It's a nit, but I think she's correct here. maybe even just long press the speaker icon to mute or something.

  
that's it. those are the only things that seemed wonky to me. i don't really notice the rattles and wind noise everyone is talking about. sure sometimes my roof bars make a little whistle. sometimes i hear a rattle somewhere. idk. it all seems really solid compared to what i had been driving. 

I wish i would have had a chance to test it in some snow. I always really appreciated how my jeep got through all the weather. It wasn't fast, but knowing that you could just slowly and reliably get there was great. I did drive the Rivian through some slushy muddy parking lots. it seemed plenty capable there. I wouldn't try to take it on the rubicon, but i never tried to take my jeep on the rubicon either. 

oh yeah. my dog LOVES the snow!"

A great two vehicle solution
I'm fortunate to own a Tesla Model S Plaid and a Rivian R1T Quad Motor. Both are great vehicles with complementary strengths and weaknesses. If I had to choose just one I honestly don't know which one I'd keep.

Advantages of the Model S:  
\- Bonkers acceleration  
\- Handling  
\- Efficiency  
\- Charging speed  
\- Snappy UX  
\- Better mobile app (slightly)  
\- Autonomous driving features (by a country mile)  
\- More comfortable seats  
\- Service (Rivian Service is overwhelmed and it shows)  
\- Quiet cabin  
\- Reliability  
\- Camera quality  
\- Sound system  
\- Accelerator pedal throttle mapping

Advantages of the R1T  
\- Ride height (nice not to have to worry about speed bumps or curbs)  
\- Off-road capability  
\- Softer ride  
\- Seating position  
\- Interior materials are more premium  
\- Blind spot warning in side view mirrors  
\- 360º camera view  
\- UX is slow, but stylish. It has a friendlier vibe than Tesla's  
\- Powered frunk  
\- Cargo space  
\- 110v outlets  
\- Onboard air compressor  
\- Full-size spare  
\- Height adjustment for the shoulder belt on the b-pillar (crazy that Model S doesn't have this)

I think that about covers it but I may have forgotten a thing or two. Happy to answer any questions!"

Issues With Auto Lock/Unlock Using Key Fob
When using my PAAK the auto lock/unlock has been pretty unreliable (on my R1S Dual Large+ Gen2). I thought that since my iPhone 15 pro max had ultra wideband that it would work well. I ended up disabling it because of its unpredictable nature. When the key fobs came out I decided to purchase since I thought it would be *much* more reliable. Unfortunately that has not been the case. I had the auto lock/unlock on only for the key fobs (and disabled for my home location). 

1) when I am at home (even though I have it disabled for my home location) I am constantly hearing the owl lock hooting sound. I take that to mean it is constantly locking and unlocking even though I’m at home. 

2) I only have the auto lock/unlock enabled for the fob and I have been surprised to see that when I am looking at my app the car has been unlocked even though I heard the owl hoot as I walked away. I have also seen the car unlocked as I approach even when I am more than 50 yards away (car lights on and unlocked and had been that way). I consider this a pretty serious issue (more than with other cars) since when a Rivian is unlocked it pops out the handles and lets everyone around know it is unlocked. 

I thought having a key fob would make this feature more reliable. Unfortunately it seems like Rivian has missed the mark on what seems very simple to me. Please look into this basic functionality u/WassymRivian
For now I have disabled the auto lock/unlock completely due to this issue. 

…and while you are looking please also look into making sure that drivers and keys that are associated with a particular user in the app syncs properly with the car. I have two key cards and two key fobs that show up correctly in the phone app but only show up in the owners profile in the car. This stuff makes the owners experience with profiles pretty frustrating. "

Shopping questions about new car options
Howdy, So I'm considering a Rivian R1S Trimotor or maybe Dual Max and had some questions. I'm looking for the most comfortable/quiet/grippy setup for summer driving. No freezing conditions or serious off-roading.

1. Has the premium audio option been sorted? I've read nothing but complaints about how bad it is. Is it looking like this is a hardware issue and won't improve or it might be a software issue that Rivian is working on? 
2. I typically don't like large wheels because the ride is too harsh and causes bent rims and flat tires on bad surfaces. I also won't be off-roading much. I was thinking about getting the all-terrain package for the 20"" wheels and swapping out the tires to a luxury suv summer sport tire. Is this foolish and should I just stick with the 22"" and get good tires on it? I know the suspension has changed a lot with Gen 2. But are 20"" wheels still the best option for a good ride if tires are the same on 22""?
3. There are some good incentives right now but I probably won't be able to purchase quickly enough to take advantage. Do we think there will be new incentives soon?
4. Is it possible they will reintroduce a 5 seat option for R1S? I will never need the 3rd row seating and would love to option them out.
5. Does Rivian ever take special requests like ordering 20"" wheels without all-terrain package? Or perhaps a different interior on a trim that's not usually offered? Ideally I'd like the slate walnut interior on a Dual Max because I don't need the performance of the trimotor. 
6. When do they usually announce model year updates? My understanding is that we're currently in the 2025 Gen 2 model year which was introduced around September of 2024. So perhaps there will be a 2026 Gen 2 update around September with different options and configurations?
7. I saw a thread about how someone was able to lease the car to take advantage of the great discounts, then immediately pay it off to save some money. I am a cash buyer so this appealed to me as a workaround to get a discount. Does this lifehack still work?
8. Do we think Rivian will offer any type of Tesla conquest bonus incentive?
9. Does Rivian negotiate at all on new and used inventory? Has anyone offered them $500 off asking price and gotten it on new or used? Do they sometimes throw in an extra charging cable or NACS adapter if asked?
10. I've read the NACS adapter and charging in general is hit or miss and glitchy. Has this improved? I'd likely be using Superchargers mostly.
11. Is mobile tech service and warranty solid for folks who don't live anywhere near service centers? Customer service is a big deal to me and I've read that Rivian reliability isn't great.
12. How reliable is the comfort access feature? I've been told as long as you have a phone in your pocket the doors will unlock. What's the approximate distance for this feature to work and does it always work? It would be a pet peeve of mine if this feature failed even 1% of the time.
13. Does the driver's seat tilt and recline some with lumbar adjustment and comfortable for big drivers? I like my seats set up like a big soft reclining chair. I hope ingress and egress is easy and comfortable.
14. Does Kneel mode work pretty well? Is it adjustable to go extra low in Kneel or single setting?
15. Anything else I should be thinking about regarding a R1S purchase?

Solar powered 12v battery tender via OBD port: any reliable options?
Any proven solar powered 12v battery tenders that work well through the OBD port for Rivian Gen 1 and Gen 2?

I'm looking to park for an extended periods of time while camping and hoping to have the solar trickle charge the 12V via OBD port. I'm hoping to use this approach to keep vampire drain to a minimum, while keeping the vehicle fully locked with no external wiring. I can place the solar panel on the dash or close to the glass roof from the inside, but preferably not on the outside of the vehicle.

I'm looking for something that's simple and basically plug-n-play. I'm not interested in approaches that will require me to disassemble any portion of the vehicle.

My search didn't yield anything obvious, but I see these products on Amazon, and curious if anyone has tried anything similar and if it works reliably with their Rivian for a similar use case as mine? If it does, any caveats to be aware of, such as how much Wattage to look for in a panel, whether  okay to use for extended periods when parked outdoors etc

Stranded by a brand new R1S
My partner received his brand new R1S last week and within four hours a battery warning popped up saying service was needed. After several days of back and forth with Rivian, they reviewed diagnostics and confirmed that the vehicle is fine to drive but will need service soon and they scheduled transport to the nearest service center. It’s unclear why this issue wasn’t identified before the vehicle was delivered, eight hours away from the nearest service center.

Then, yesterday, the vehicle completely died while he was on the road. He had to pull over and then get a tow back home. The vehicle won’t move on its own at all, not even the 15mph crawl. It’s now parked outside our house until the previously scheduled tow back to the service center.

I’m posting this because my partner doesn’t have a Reddit account and I want to make sure others are aware of another instance of poor QA and reliability. I’ve been a fan of Rivian for years and even had a R1T reserved at one point. I had mainly been concerned about charging access in the mountains, but apparently the real concern is where it will randomly strand you."

NACS: An Unpopular View
TLDR: NACS will not become the dominant format. 

The long version: This has nothing to do with politics, please keep logics out of this thread.  

As EV adoption grows, demand for access to fast-charging is well beyond what Tesla’s fast charging network could offer. Tesla would have to invest 100 billion into building out its charging infrastructure if it wants to meet the demand that will exist in ten years. That’s not going to happen.

What is happening is that charging networks have matured and got serious about building out a reliable amenity-rich customer focused and frictionless experience. Oil and energy companies are investing billions into next gen charger tech with CCS plugs that is quickly surpassing Tesla’s superchargers. Megawatt stations are already popping up. 

The future belongs to CCS. "

There was discussion going on in another thread regarding whether Rivian is developing Autonomy features in-house. I think this confirms it. Entire Autonomy platform stack is developed by Rivian in-house, including the models. Thats pretty good but Rivian is entering a critical period as more and more people start using this feature for more and more miles driven. There will be complaints about it not being available on all roads and stuff like that. But Tesla's stack developed the same way. Just hope Rivian continues to deliver on this. A truly reliable highway assist that is better than Tesla thanks to better sensors and compute on-board will be a game-changer for the adventure community. "

Disappointed in Rivian’s pre-purchase customer service.
Since I’m new to EVs and buying a car online I have been trying to get questions answered, dot my “I”s and cross my “T”s before making my final decision. Seems understandable considering the investment. I keep having to wait days to get questions answered that should be easy and same day. And a couple of the people representatives at the 800 number have given me wrong information. For example they told me to enter the EV upgrade discount into the down payment field. Found out that was wrong. Another person told me that the Dual Standards have the Vision and Sound package, “just keep looking on the website” even though it’s not an option when building a Dual Standard. I am hearing different information on GAP insurance. Some people have said it’s included in the lease but the sales person says it’s extra with their insurance company. Again, I have been waiting for someone to contact me but no one does.
I learned here on Reddit that charging slows down on all of the batteries so 80% is the common charging point on road trips. This has made me want to consider the Max battery upgrade again. Since there isn’t a field in the calculator to work in the 3k EV upgrade discount so I can compare the difference in price, I emailed the salesperson I did the test drive with but he didn’t respond to my email. So yesterday I reached out to Rivian and the persons said a sales person would contact me. No one got back to me yesterday. In order to take advantage of the current offers you have to take possession by March 31 yet they delay the buying process. It’s so frustrating. It’s making concerned for the actually owning/leasing customer service. At this point I want to work with a different sales person. I wish I could just call the Venice location but there isn’t a local number. I’m beginning to think Rivian might not be reliable if problems arise. "

For current owners: What changes to new models would make you upgrade?
Happy Gen 1 Quad R1S owner. I love so much about this vehicle. It hauls kids, sports gear, my boat, work stuff, etc. It’s fun to drive on the road, it goes great in the sand, it’s so capable off road. 

As I was looking over the new features on Gen 2, I thought to myself, while those new features are nice, nothing was compelling enough to upgrade (though the insane numbers on the new quad are tempting). So I thought over what would get me to upgrade. 

Here is my list of what would almost definitely get me to trade up, by order of importance:

1. Charging Speed 

I don’t mind stopping every two hours or so on long drives, but on long work trips, if those stops could be shorter, it would save a solid amount of time. 800v architecture or some other solution to bring 10-80% closer to 10-15 minutes on a Max pack would be a game changer for me.

2. Range/Battery Capacity 

This goes hand in with number one but is slightly lower priority for me… if charging speeds could increase enough. 500-600 miles of range would put 99% of my drives within one required charge stop. This would also open up real world towing capabilities. (I can’t tow my boat to any destination because of lack of reliable chargers near by, even then, it would be such a slog, I’d probably rather just boat to my destination haha.)

3. Autonomous driving

For the most part, I actually enjoy hands on driving my Rivian. It’s just plain fun. Until I get on the road for long monotonous drives. This is the lowest on my list, but an eyes off autonomous driving Rivian would let me work while on the road at such greater efficiency that I would be compelled to upgrade. 

So let’s hear it! What feature or improvement would compel you to upgrade your beloved Rivian to the next Gen?"

Frequent camera activation failures - Reboot required
I have had a gen2 R1S Max since September. The car has been great, and I've had very few issues with it besides this one. Every so often the Cameras would fail to activate, and I'm presented with the screen below suggesting a reboot. The issue was infrequent and mostly occurred when I got in the vehicle and shifted to Reverse. This activates the cameras and boom, I can't see anything. I first hit this when trying to turn of Gear Guard, and figured it was a bug or reliability issue around that feature. I avoided using a flash drive for months as a result and the problem was infrequent. A Gear Guard got more updates and fixes, I enabled it and the frequency of the error remained low.

Recently, perhaps since January and a run of colder temperatures in the mid-30F range, this has been striking more frequently. Perhaps 25% of the times I dive. And it's started to happen after I'm already driving and crashing as I back into a parking space or parallel park. It's gone from being a nuisance to a real safety problem.

Currently it does not seem to matter if I have a (recommended) USB-C flash drive installed or Gear Guard activated or not. I've removed the flash drive on the suspicion that was a factor and still experience this crash. A few times I've had to reboot 2-3 times in a row before the cameras works. I've done hard resets as well on occasion. No improvements from the hard reset.

I've come to the conclusion that this is not just a typical Rivian software bug but is developing into an actual defect in my car. I've searched this forum and other resources but as best I can tell this has not been reported as a >frequent< issue of the type I am experiencing.

Are there any suggestions or thoughts on this before I contact Rivian for a service call?

Charging Adapers - Help Please
Trying to make some sense what adapter will be needed where.  I'm coming from a Model Y and looking into an R1S with max batter.  I have a Tesla wall charger installed at my house and expect to leverage the Supercharger network on longer trips.

What I've gleaned from various youtube videos is that I'll need at least two adapters for home and on the road

This guy to access relevant superchargers (V3 and V4):

And this guy so I can continue to use my wall charger:

I understand there are a lot of non-Tesla chargers available, but given my current set up and reliability (or non reliablity of non-tesla charging options (eg. electify 'murica)). I just want to make sure I have my bases covered and have a decent understanding on how to prepare.

  
Thanks

Delivery anxieties
Hi all, I’m scheduled to take delivery of a 2025 R1S Dual Max in the next couple of weeks. I’m excited having been impressed on a couple of demo drives and generally favorable reviews from “professionals” and owners alike.

That being said, I’m getting nervous having read several threads of poor reliability and repair experiences. For context, my other vehicle is a Polestar 2 that I’ve owned for 3 years. In that time it’s been in the shop 5-6 times for various issues (rattles, sensors that have gone bad, phone as key stopped working, etc.) but repairs have always been quick and there has always been a Polestar loaner available.

I just want to know, particular from Gen 2 owners, am I setting myself up for pain? I’m well accustomed to software glitches (Polestar’s software is its Achilles heal) but I’m worried about issues that require service visits. Am I getting into a situation where this thing ends up sitting at an SC more than my driveway and I’m routinely living with an inconvenience?

FWIW, I’m in the greater Seattle area for which I believe there to be 3 SCs. Minor rattles, wind noise, panel alignments don’t bother me much. It’s the out of service time that I’m concerned about.

Thank you to anyone who can share their thoughts/experiences."

Gen2 KeyFobs Available again!
If you were like me, and you’ve been refreshing the Rivian Gear Shop daily, hoping the key fob would be in st0ck—good news, it’s finally back!

Why am I getting a fob? Like many others, I found the phone key to be hit or miss, and it got frustrating when it wouldn’t work—especially when my hands were full, like carrying my toddler. Definitely ready for a more reliable option!"

Possibly looking into buying our first EV
Hey guys,

  
Currently we have a '21 Yukon. We will have 3 kids under 5. Yukon requires '3 quarts of oil' between each oil change. This is 'acceptable' for them.

  
So I am curious on 3 things.

  
1) I am looking for reliability (7+) years. Do any of you have thoughts on the reliability on these vehicle?

2) Do you think the rivian could comfortably fit 6 passengers and have sufficient room in the trunk for luggage/etc. for 6 people?

3) My biggest concern is additional time on road trips. We routinely make 8 hr road trips(\~550 miles) (2-4x a year). How much extra time will it take to charge? How good is the fast charging? How reliable is the network?

Thanks Guys!

\- Going out saturday to do a test of the unit."

Thinking about minivan to R1S
Hey there. Currently own an older Model S and a Honda Odyssey. We’re thinking of trading in the Ody for a 2023 R1S. 

Did a test drive of a Gen2, have done a ton of research, but was just wondering “real-world” if this is a logical step. 

We do take the Odyssey on long (~2400 mile round trip) excursions, but those are few and far between. I’m more concerned about something like a ~300 mile trip (one way) to get my kids to college with their stuff in the cold (NY). We’ve taken relatively long trips in the Model S and the software has been exceptional at getting us to the next supercharger, indicating availability, and telling us how long it will take. Is the Rivian experience (charging multiple times over longer trips) reliable and accurate? Obviously one of Tesla’s big advantages is the charging network but with Rivian being able to access it, are the routing and recharging options similar? The folks at the Rivian showroom said “no problem”, I’d love a slightly less biased take.

Sorry if this has already been discussed, I couldn’t find it. I know the X and Y are options, but there are many reasons I’m much more interested in the R1S. Thanks!"

Rivian highway assist
I am looking into replacing my Tesla M3 with Gen2 R1S and planning on using it to commute. It will mainly be Southern California highway driving. I have seen mixed reviews on Rivian’s highway assist features. Those of you who use it for commuting or better if you commute in LA/OC area, do you find it reliable and useful? I heard there was going to be an update in January. Has that happened and if so, did it improve the highway assist feature? I rely on autopilot to survive the LA traffic and can’t imagine driving without lane keeping and adaptive cruise control capabilities. I know it’s not as good as Tesla autopilot yet but is it good enough?"

Camp Speaker waking up while docked
Other than unpairing (or setting it on file, or smashing it with a hammer) - has anyone figured out a reliable, reproducible way to stop the cursed thing from waking up every once in a while *while docked inside a sleeping vehicle in the garage*, connecting to phone, and resuming playing whatever the phone was last playing?

I thought I had it figured out months ago. I hard reset the thing a couple of times - not the 30-second-hold reboot, but the 7-second 3-button hold to restore to factory settings. I then hard rebooted the car for good measure, then paired the thing to phone - and it seemed to have behaved. Turns out it just forgot the phone. And I didn’t realize until today, because I never use the thing. 

But today I decided to futz with the speaker while trying to install the update, realized it’s no longer paired to phone, did the factory reset thing again, re-paired - and boom, the darn thing keeps waking and starting to play stuff from my phone every 30-45 min or whatever. 

Help?!"

Tesla owner looking to switch
I've been wanting an EV truck for a while now and initially hoped the Cybertruck would be the one—but I just can’t see myself paying for or driving that thing. Now, with Musk’s recent controversies (Him being a Natzi imo) , I’m considering trading in my wife’s Model Y for another EV, possibly an R1S or a lease until the R2 comes out. But what I *really* want to get soon is an R1T.

I’ve done some research, and aside from the longer range and the 2.0 updates, what are the key advantages of a new R1T (Dual or Dual Max) over a 2022 Adventure or Launch Edition? If I can get around *270 real-world miles* per charge, I’d be happy with that.

Used R1Ts seem to be quite discounted, and I haven’t found any major reliability concerns—are the 2.0 updates *that* much better? I’m also debating whether to wait a few months in case new models start shipping with NACS plugs, which could push me toward buying new since we already have a home wall charger.

Apologies for the newbie questions! I’m well-versed in Tesla’s specs, pricing, and ecosystem, but I’d love some guidance from the Rivian community to help make the switch."

Completed a US to Canada winter road trip with my gen1 R1S
Recently completed a winter road trip from Seattle WA to Kelowna BC Canada, just to share my experience.

[the route](https://preview.redd.it/fjh0jjmb9iee1.png?width=897&format=png&auto=webp&s=71a8d1999aeaed39806cc73bc67bba758216348f)

Concerned before the trip for mainly three reasons

1. Snowy and icy road condition on BC Hwy 5 (Coquihalla highway) and 97c (Okanagan Connector)

2. Reliability of the R1S as I had one breakdown and few other issues within the first few months of ownership

3. EV range in winter weather

We bought a set of winter tires to for this trip:

[MSW type 52 20\\"" wheel + Michelin X-Ice snow 275\/60\/r20](https://preview.redd.it/tcdlj4787iee1.jpg?width=1280&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e2a8f948698e33c87b5028e011e36845eeb7be02)

We stopped at two Tesla superchargers in Hope, BC and Merritt, BC, we could finish with just 1 charging stop, but if road closure happens on these mountain passes, we could sit in car waiting for hours, so we charge to 80% at each supercharger just to be safe.

Driving from Seattle to Hope, BC is easy (Leaving soc 100%, Arrival soc 40%ish), we stopped at our first charging stop, there are 24 V3 superchargers available, we are the only one charging at the time, charged to 75%, it's in a big truck stop, has shower, lounge, food and drink, also dog friendly.

[Hope, BC Tesla Supercharger](https://reddit.com/link/1i76lel/video/59mz9xke7iee1/player)

Driving from Hope, BC to Merritt BC through Hwy 5 (Leaving soc 75%, Arrival soc 50%ish), weather is Sunny, roads are plowed, just a lot of melted snow mixed with mud\\sand, and when other cars pass you, you just got sprayed\\splashed, we turned on snow mode.

[BC Hwy 5](https://reddit.com/link/1i76lel/video/igoqlz4l7iee1/player)

Second charging stop in Merritt, BC, there are a combination of v3 and v4 superchargers in Merritt, we choose the v4 charger and met another R1S from Seattle area, chatted a bit and charged to 80%, hotel, fast food and convenient store available. 

[Merritt, BC supercharger](https://reddit.com/link/1i76lel/video/rx6tvh4q7iee1/player)

Last part: Driving from Merritt, BC to Kelowna, BC through 97c (leaving soc 80%, arriving soc 50%ish), same road condition, smooth driving, arrived safely.

The aftermath:

Lesson learned: Bring windshield wiper fluid, check weather and DriveBC.ca for road condition.

We did not see many EVs on this route, only few Tesla and 1 Rivian at Merritt supercharger, and still got skeptical looks from gas car drivers when we pull in the stops.

Overall We arrived safely, charging at Tesla superchargers also worked reliably, I feel more confident driving the R1S after this trip, hope this is is helpful or entertaining to you guys.

Reliable performance over 4,000 mile Southwest adventure (R1S Tri)
Over the holidays, my R1S Tri was terrific during a 3 week, 4k+ mile tour of the Southwest with 11k feet of elevation change, 21 degree primitive roads, sub-zero temps and long distances between charging in remote locations. My pup and I slept comfortably using camp mode and prepared meals on the tailgate. She transitioned well between primitive roads, interstates, cities and snowy mountain passes. All in all, it just works for me. Of course, she now has some desert pinstriping and dust in places that will be difficult to clean, but I don’t mind that. During the trip she was a reliable adventure vehicle with enough range and capability to spontaneously explore interesting places whenever they popped up.

On retracting door handles
I was walking in the garage besides the car and I bumped into the door handle that sticks out because I'm afraid to lock my car in the garage because it keeps locking and unlocking constantly and to my recollection drained the battery like crazy although we are a few software updates ahead of that and the vampire drain at 1-1.5%/day still sucks with leaving the doors unlocked, but I digress.

It really hurt my elbow and I wish we could get car wash mode door handles so that,

1. Manual door handles eliminate motors (cost down)
2. Door handle motors never fail (reliability)
3. We don't invite onlookers to open the doors when our cool cars are unlocked (safety)
4. Car can check I'm around it only when I pull on the door handles, eliminating the 5 second wait or worse having to pull phone out of pocket in hopes the car unlocks (convenience)
5. I don't hurt myself walking into these over engineered door handles (health and wellbeing)

I recall R2 will make this change but I want a SW toggle so I can pull on the door handles myself and I'm sure are there are dozens of us!"

Premium Sound Paired with Glass Roof. Why, Oh Why?
Thanks to the Elon meltdown and recent snow events where I live, there's a Rivian in my near future.

Let me tell you a pet peeve: complicated technology solutions to problems already well solved. As a modest example: the metal roof on my old BMW has done a fine job of keeping the rain out of my car for 25 years. Even when I've owned a convertible, I don't look up while I'm driving. I look forward through the windshield. 

I do, however appreciate that stalwart metal roof that, with no technology complexity at all, keeps the sun from coming down into my eyes and the rain out of my car. In over 40 years of driving now, I have never had a metal roof crack or ""stop working"" in some way. 40 years, literally zero problems. Metal, roof: reliable. proven. simple.

Now, I'm not saying that you should not like the Rivian glass roof; more power if you love your glass roof! 

I am saying that if you asked me to pay $500 for a metal roof instead of an overly complex piece of glass roof technology, on a truck that's over $70k, I would find that cheap at the price. 

So why .... for the love of Baldr .... can I not get a nicer stereo without this complicated thing that I literally do not want and would pay to not have?

(Of course the answer is probably: streamlining manufacturing complexity.... which is a totally valid answer.)

When push comes to shove, I'm probably going to put up with the peasant sound system..... Sigh. No extra money for you Rivian."

Is Rivian close to ""Have to be there"" reliability yet?
Update: we put down a deposit on a Green Dual Large Battery. We pick it up when we get back in town from vacation. Thank you for the input. The Rivian won’t be the only vehicle to drive we just didn’t want it breaking down on the highway driving or in the entrance to the garage of the hospital. It seems like those days are over. 

We are interested in an R1S Dual Standard. My wife is an OBGYN, and one night a week + one weekend a month she is the OBGYN on-call for a local hospital. If they give her a ring (regardless of time) = she has to be there could be to deliver a baby, perform a surgery, or whatever else is needed.

We are in the St Louis Metro, and deal with a road that floods twice a year with a few inches of water, we can get 6 inches of snow and ice, 100+F summers and sometimes below zero winters. No matter what = she has to be there. We feel as if the Rivian could handle these things, but...

**I have seen a couple instances of R1S and R1T catastrophically bricking out and needing long service center stays,** *is this still an issue?*

We have 2 acquaintances that have had **no issues** and absolutely love their Rivians. One racked up 22K miles in their first year of ownership after falling in love with Rivian Road Trips. The other acquaintance quickly grew jealous of his wife's R1S and purchased an R1T to replace his rather new pickup, and cannot say enough nice things.

We would love to get one, the only hang up is the reliability, is this still a worry?

We are on the fence between a leasing a Rivian Dual Standard or a Toyota Land Cruiser 250. The LC 250 will likely be incredibly reliable, but not be thrilling to drive. The Rivian has 533 horsepower and that is awesome. Our Demo Drive is in 2 days. Wanted to get first hand experience from you fine folks. Thanks for weighing in."

New or Used?
I've long been interested in getting a Rivian R1S and am getting close to finally pulling the trigger. The major point I'm considering is whether to go new or used. I'd be saving ~$20k going the used route, but am a little more concerned about service/reliability issues going the used route. My sense is that, by going the new route, Rivian would be much more accommodating to any potential issues that arise with the car. Is there any merit to that assumption in this group's experience? I will say I'm a bit more sensitive to service/reliability issues as we are a one-car household. 

Any other major things to consider when choosing new vs used?

For what it's worth, I've done enough research on the Gen1 vs Gen2 differences to decide there's no big difference to me between either option. And, from a financial perspective, I could go the new route without really affecting my financial status but, hey, $20k is still $20k. "

Pretty Disappointed in my Rivian experience so far
Hey Everyone,

  
Wanted to share my experience so far and hear from other owners if this is a more common occurrence than I realized.



I've had only electric cars for 6 or so years now. I've been only in Teslas up until last year (Model 3 and Model Y). I've been watching the R1S roll out, and with the addition of a new lease program, I pulled the trigger last year.

  
I ended up with a Dual Motor R1S with Max Battery Pack.

  
I've been driving it and enjoying the experience so far, but on a casual drive the other day, my car had a major issue.

  
It felt like I ran over a rumble strip in the road, then the dashboard lit up. I lost power to the rear motor and the car went into ""turtle"" mode. Screen told me to service soon.

  
I parked the car, and when I got back into it, it tried to power up the rear motor and had some pretty bad grinding noises.

  
Spoke with Rivian and after a restart, was able to drive it up the the service center the next day on front wheel drive only. Keep in mind I have just over 4,000 miles on the car at this point.

  
The car has been sitting there since December 9th. I was told they would need the car for 2-5 weeks and could not provide a Rivian loaner. I have been given a Enterprise rental car (that experience has been horrendous in itself. Had 2 different cars now due to issues and been asked to trade it again so they can sell the one I have).

  
I had heard nothing over the past month despite reaching out over the app to my service advisor. 

I finally called yesterday since I was getting notifications that my batter charge was extremely low. I was informed that they have not looked at the car yet, and haven't even assigned a technician to it. My battery was sitting at 5%, and they told me they would go and plug it in, and thanked me for letting them know.

  
They said they are overwhelmed with a back log, and are flying people in from all over the US to the Atlanta service center to try to catch up on the backlog (technicians, managers, etc.)

  
This is by far the most expensive car I have owned. I know Rivian has had some reliability issues, but to hear that they have such a big back log of cars they need to work on was pretty surprising. Hoping they follow through with my request to reimburse me for my lease payments while the car isn't in my possession.

My 5 Month experience
This is my first main EV that I'm living with. 5 month in and I love the drive and the feel of the vehicle. 

I always look forward to driving this thing but it is not without it's quirks. I do feel like this is really a computer on wheels...unfortunately it feels like a MS Windows on wheels instead of Mac lol. Fam, tell me if I'm the only one doing this or others are too...I find myself needing to reboot my car almost once a month because something is not working correctly. This week has been the worst for me, I've had to HW reboot at at least 5 times this week. 2 just last night because one time the heat was suddenly blasting cold air when I wanted heat and another time my sensors was off...oh and I even had a phantom breaking event probably due to the sensor issues. 

The odd thing was, this past update had been pretty solid until this week where these little things are popping up! I'm ready for the next update though lol 

  
I love this thing...but sometimes its hard to defend it's reliability to my wife lol "

First sizable roadtrip in R1S
We returned last night from our annual extended family trip to Disneyland, driving from Bay Area (east bay) to Anaheim and back. This was an important “test” to give my wife added confidence on the viability of EVs in long distance trips. Overall the SUV passed her skepticism pretty easily but not flawlessly. 

Charging - we were able to exclusively hit RANs during the whole trip. They worked perfectly, were never over-crowded, though my wife did notice a drop in kw rates when another Rivian pulled up and began drawing power from the same cabinet. We were able to get coffee, stretch and relax and time it fairly well with the charging time. We were more conservative than we probably needed to be with doing extra large charging sessions (dual max) as we didn’t want to rely on charging at the hotel. 

Hotel charging - I believe we lucked out here with some attentive valet personnel but giving a bit of an extra tip helped here 😀. We stayed at the Grand Californian which has valet charging. Their official policy is two hours of courtesy charging which on a 6.5 kWh charger isn’t much. With a $20 tip at drop off the valet kept it on until we got to 80% and they then topped it off on the day of departure which was very nice of them. Again, not completely reliable, given how receptive one valet driver is to the next, but it is possible to get a decent charge through valet. I’m curious other’s experience with similar hotels. 

Quirkiness of the SUV - The R1S was basically flawless except for one full reset I needed to do. I noticed while the SUV was parked in valet after a few days it wasn’t going to sleep. I didn’t do anything about it but noticed a larger than usual phantom drain, like 2-3% but given it was the tail end of our trip I left it as is at valet. When we got on the road, all of the sensor warning lights were on, ACC and driver assist were unavailable and the map was completely bonkers, showing our position like 20 miles west of where we actually were. I did a full reset at a RAN and everything came back normal, so I’m not sure what happened with it parked at valet. 

Overall my wife thought the trip went well, I think we now have more confidence to do smaller, more frequent charges so that the time to charge doesn’t take so long. The SUV was super comfortable for us and the kids and overall I’m super happy with how it performed!"

Tesla vs Rivian: An EV Owner's Detailed Comparison
My TLDR advice: “Car guys” might lean towards Rivian for its utility and luxury, while “tech guys” would likely prefer Tesla for its superior technology and driving dynamics.  
  
Having owned a Tesla Model Y, a Gen 1 Rivian R1T, and most recently, the Tesla Cybertruck, I've gathered substantial firsthand experience with these electric vehicles. My aim is to provide insights to help others make an informed choice between these two brands.

**Software:** Tesla’s software is notably superior in terms of speed and features. Their navigation is reliable and extensive, especially in complex areas marked by townships, where Rivian's system, which relies on OpenStreetMap via Mapbox, often struggles. Additionally, Tesla's smartphone app is more advanced than Rivian’s.

**Features:** **Camera and Display:** Tesla's cameras offer higher image quality, but Rivian’s bird's eye view is remarkably convenient for parking and tight spots. **Climate Control:** Rivian's climate system struggles in cold weather, failing to reach the set temperature promptly, unlike Tesla's, which warms up more efficiently. **Autopilot:** Tesla's autopilot is significantly more reliable, capable of handling long distances without intervention, whereas Rivian's system frequently requires driver input even on shorter trips.

**Utility:** For hauling cargo, Rivian's R1T is robust and capable. However, for family needs, Tesla's models, especially the Cybertruck, offer more space and comfort. The spacious arrangement allows ample room between car seats and the front seats, making it a better fit for families, especially for someone who is 5'11"" like myself.

**Aesthetics and Interior:** Rivian wins on interior design and aesthetics, providing a luxury feel with superior materials and craftsmanship. Tesla’s interiors are more minimalist, which might appeal to those who prefer a simpler, tech-focused environment.

**Driving Experience:** Tesla excels with its responsive throttle, quick acceleration, and tighter steering, offering a more engaging drive. While Rivian provides a satisfactory performance, it doesn't match Tesla’s “fun factor.”

**Leadership/Company Ethics:** Discussing company ethics, both Tesla and Rivian have their controversies. Rivian's decision to backtrack on software updates for Gen 1 vehicles without offering compensation was disappointing. Tesla, under Elon Musk’s unpredictable leadership, presents its own set of challenges. This section may invite bold discussion, but it's an honest reflection of the companies' attitudes towards their customers.

**Conclusion:** In summary, choose Rivian if you value a premium interior, better aesthetics, and strong utility capabilities. Opt for Tesla if your priority lies in advanced technology and a dynamic driving experience. "

Turoed a R1S. It seems like a perfect dog car!  has pet mode ever let anyone down?
tldr: pet mode seems like a killer feature for me. does it ever go flakey and just turn off like ... adaptive cruise control?

I currently drive a '17 wrangler rubicon with 100k miles on it. I'm in the market for a new car. The wranglers that i like are now in the $80k area, and honestly, that seems ridiculous. Plus, my life has changed since '17. I have a 4 month old puppy that is rapidly growing into a 50 lbs dog, and i really feel the need for more space than what i have in the wrangler.

Enter the R1S. Rather than just do a test drive, i decided to turo one for a week. i LOVED it. honestly, i don't think i even need to test drive any of the other cars on my list. (defender, gx, land cruiser, another wrangler) The ride was great. The space was perfect. It felt like it had all the offroad capabilities that i need. It was nice not buying $91 of gas that week, and instead only spending $30 on charging at evgo (i've been assured that that's even the expensive electricity)

The thing that really impressed me was how perfect it seemed for my dog. 

I do things where my dog will sit in the car and wait for me. surfing, skateboarding, snowboarding, mountain biking. These are all things where i might be gone for an hour or two. come back and she's just happily waiting in the car with the windows cracked, under a tree, etc. i realized that i NEED a car with pet mode! I know teslas and some other ev's do it, but none of the ICE cars on my list do. This seems like an absolutely killer feature to me. 

I see complaints on here about needing to reset the car to get adaptive cruise control to work sometimes, or some other convenience feature suddenly not working. That all seems slightly annoying on a $100k vehicle, but it also seems like it's merely annoying if i have to maintain speed on my own.

if pet mode were to fail.... that could be disastrous. Is it pretty reliable? I understand that it uses battery and all that. i'd have to learn what the drain is in the environment i'm trying to protect my dog from. That's fine, does it ever just turn off for no reason and you come back to find your little buddy overheated or freezing? (yike)

Also, if you are still reading, the frunk proved to be the PERFECT place to store my pup's bag. It's usually got some treats in it and i hate leaving it in the cabin with her. i know she can smell it and i bet it kind of drives her crazy knowing there are treats around. "

1,700-Mile Trip Impressions
I’ve had my 2025 R1S Dual Motor Standard (with 22” Sport Wheels) for two months now, and I’ve already racked up over 5,000 miles. Last week, we embarked on a road trip from Illinois to Florida and back, so I thought I’d share some thoughts and insights from the journey.

**Trip Statistics:**

* **Distance:** \~1,736 miles total (\~1,600 highway miles)
* **Time:** \~30 hours of driving (\~24 on highways)
* **Energy Consumption:** 871 kWh (\~1.99 mi/kWh efficiency)

Here’s a breakdown of what I loved about the experience, a few minor annoyances, and one significant disappointment.

**What I Loved**

1. **Driving Dynamics & Comfort** The driving feel, handling, and ride quality were outstanding. These are hands down my favorite aspects of the car (besides its stunning looks).
2. **Reliability** I didn’t experience any major reliability issues—no sensor malfunctions, battery failures, or software bugs, which some users have reported here. Just smooth sailing overall.
3. **Fast Charging** Even without Rivian Adventure Network (RAN) chargers along my route, Tesla Superchargers with the NACS adapter worked seamlessly. The charging process was fast and hassle-free.
4. **Driver Assistance Features** Adaptive cruise control and auto lane-change assist made highway driving much more relaxed and enjoyable (when they worked).
5. **Dynamic High-Beam Lighting** Watching the adaptive high-beams adjust dynamically was both fun and practical. It’s a clever safety feature I really appreciated during night driving.
6. **Entertainment During Stops** Having YouTube and Plex casting on the center display during charging stops was a surprisingly delightful experience. It really helped pass the time.

**Minor Hiccups & Annoyances**

1. **Highway Assist Limitations** There were stretches of road where the highway driver assist wasn’t available, which was a bit disappointing.
2. **Inconsistent LTE Connection** Rivian’s LTE connection was occasionally slower than expected, likely due to AT&T coverage in certain areas.
3. **Hood Flutter** The hood noticeably fluttered at high speeds or in strong headwinds. It wasn't significant but it was noticable.

**The One Major Disappointment: Efficiency**

The biggest downside was the vehicle’s efficiency on highways, especially in colder weather (We were 4 adults and 2 children and had no cargo boxes or hitched up trailers). Here are some specifics:

* **Colder Temperatures (around freezing):** Efficiency dropped to \~1.4 mi/kWh at \~75 mph.
* **Cooler Temps (40–50°F):** Efficiency hovered between 1.8–2.0 mi/kWh.

For a vehicle with a Standard battery pack (\~90 kWh usable capacity), this translates to a practical highway range of about 130 miles per charge (note that on a road trip you typically don't want to charge all the way up to 100% and you don't want to arrive empty at your next stop). While stopping every two hours or so was fine for us, the inefficiency resulted in some significant amount of enery lost, which I had to pay for at fast chargers. Fast charging for the trip cost us about $410 (using Tesla Superchargers). It’s a significant expense considering the amount of energy lost due to inefficiency.

**Final Thoughts** Despite the efficiency concerns, I absolutely love my R1S. Its design, driving dynamics, and overall functionality make it a fantastic vehicle. However, for frequent highway travelers, especially in colder climates, the efficiency issue is something to consider. Hopefully, future updates or improvements address this!

Would love to hear others' thoughts or experiences.

One Year Review
We picked up our 2024 R1S on 12/29/2023 and drove home for 3+ hours in an “atmospheric river” downpour, roads closed and flooding – it performed amazingly! Now we have traveled 13,800 miles in “Bear,” and have loved every minute of it.

For anyone considering Buying a Rivian, here is my **One Year Review**!

I have previously owned some great SUVs, including two Lexus and a Volvo XC90 PHEV. Without question the Rivian has been far better by leaps and bounds. It has been an absolute delight to drive.

“Range anxiety” has not an issue. We have driver on numerous long trips, one towing a trailer over the Siskiyous in a storm – no problems. We have driven over Vale Pass twice in blizzard conditions, through heat, snow, and major rain, towed our camper and utility trailers, and hauled a lot of stuff without a hint of a problem. Our total mi/kwh is 2.20. I am happy with that.

We have not had any mechanical or software issues. Frankly, I think that is the norm. I have spoken to lots of Rivian owners on out travels, which has been the shared view. I am glad for that since our SC is a 3-hour drive from our house. This week Rivian is sending a mobile unit to replace our battery, I guess, a warranty issue. I had them come to rotate the tires at 7,500 mi and do an inspection.

The software update process is great. They have fixed or added many features. I love the music upgrades and now we have SiriusXM without streaming it from the phone. Also, getting the Tesla adapter is cool, though we didn’t need it on any of our trips. Other upgrades have been amazing and beneficial.

There are a few things that I would like to see in future updates. One, better texting/calling support. I understand this is coming in 2025, I cannot wait. I have grown so dependent on this feature having spent a lot of time on the road before I retired. My Volvo was amazing with this service. Second, I would love to see the frunk inside release button also serve as a close button. Not a big deal. Lastly, I want V2H bidirectional charging to work with our solar. In CA we are subject to black/brown outs and frequent power outages. Sure, I can and have plugged into the car for needed power, but I want an automatic whole house system. Rivian said they are working on a biD unit; I hope its soon and affordable.

My wife and I totally concur, the Rivian has been the best vehicle we have owned in our 50 years together. Its fun, reliable and very safe; AND we’re not burning fossil fuels. One year down and many more to go!"

Stick together at Tesla Superchargers and everything is fine. 
Just completed a trip from San Diego to Mammoth. When we got to the supercharger, there were actually more Rivians than Teslas for a brief moment. 

Everyone was fine with it and as time goes on not only will we get stations with longer V4 cables but it’ll naturally work itself out. Use superchargers, they are great and extremely reliable. 

So far on a few road trips we have not had any issues. Take that anecdote for what it’s worth versus all the complaints on here."

Gen 2 R1S, first road trip report, focusing on charging and ADAS
Before I go into this, the truck is the best vehicle I've ever owned (leased).  But, after going on my first extended road trip, there are some things I noticed coming from a Tesla.  Its focused on charging and ADAS.  I've driven many cars of various types that have some form of autonomous driving.  Kia/Hyundai, BMW, Tesla, etc.

1. Rivias ADAS is the worst of them all.  Here's why.  It only works on mapped highways.  Key work being ""mapped"".  You will never know which highways are mapped ahead of time and even if a highway IS mapped, it will disengage at any point if anything is remotely wrong.

\- A slight turn ahead that may be a little sharper? Turns off

\- Going under an underpass that's a slightly long?  Turns off

\- A merge coming up, turns off

\- A split coming up, turns off

\- more than 5 birds in the air?  Turns off.

\- the road is too straight for too long?  Turns off (I'm kidding here.  But I've had it just stop on open road for no reason).

2. When it turns off, you have no idea when you can turn it back on.  So every few minutes, you try it again. then again,  then again.  Then you give up.  Then you'll try it again sometime later.  This happened so often, that my kids starting playing a game of ""will it work now?"".  In a 9 hour drive, it let me turn it on for maybe 4 hours of it.  ALL highway on a massive interstate.  Ive had to turn it on and off more than 50 times during this time.  At some point, I just gave up on it.

3. It doesn't like merging cars.  In fact, I'm not even sure it sees the merging car.  It will only slow down if the car merges fully into your lane.  It detects this so late, it triggers the collision warning.  Going 75 MPH and getting a collision warning is a scary as all hell.  It felt like if I didnt brake quickly, there would have been a collision at high speed.  On this road trip, happened twice.  I dont feel safe using it anymore because of this and if I do, I'm white knucking it.

4. When you are in traffic, it doesn't work.  if you are in stop and go, when stopped, it tells you it can't find the lines and disengages.  Now, if it simply did that, it would be a pain, but it does more than that.  The entire screen flashes red really rapidly and a fucking bomb siren goes off in the cabin.  If your grandma and kids were sleeping in the back, they are wide awake now.  So I no longer use it in stop and go traffic because that warning sounds like a friggin cruise missile is inbound and WW3 started.

So...if I can't use it on highways reliably and can't use it in stop and go reliably, what is it good for?  A surefire way to get a headache is what I surmised.

like I said, I love the car.  Its the best I've ever owned.  But to call what they have as ""autonomous driving"" is more than a joke.  It's very embarrassing and borderline fraud.

I get that its early for them.  But for them to be this far behind everyone else, even discount cars, is very disappointing.  If you're coming from a ICE vehicle, you'll love it.  If you're coming from an EV, there are parts that will disappoint you, specifically the autonomous driving part.

edit: I did a 3 hour road trip on my Tesla Model Y.  It took me from my driveway, to my destination driveway at my family's home, with ZERO interruption (not caused by me) the entire trip.  3 hours across local streets, highway on ramps and off ramps, merges and switches....straight to the driveway of my destination.  I talked to my family the whole way.

  
edit: If I were to do it again, would I buy the Rivian again?  Yes.  It's the best EV truck on the market, period."

R1S Tri-motor vs Porsche Macan EV vs Lucid
I currently have reservations for all three and need to decide on one by the end of the year. My current car is a 2022 Tesla Model S.

Here are my thoughts so far:
	•	Rivian (Tri-Motor): Leaning against it due to reliability concerns and the service nightmare. Appointments are backed up for over four months, which is a major downside.
	•	Porsche Macan EV: Reliable with excellent service, but the software is subpar, and it’s smaller than I’d prefer.
	•	Lucid Air GT: A fun car to drive, and the customer service is supposedly excellent—they send a flatbed with a loaner if needed. However, reliability concerns remain, though seemingly less so than with the Rivian.

What are your thoughts? Which would you choose?

Addendum: yes I know they are different classes altogether; SUV vs sedan don’t have a preference. Priorities - electric long range w reliability. "

Pulled the trigger, and couldn’t be happier
This is my first EV, and I was terrified about this purchase because of the alleged reliability issues. But all I can say right now is how in love I am with this car, and how well it drives for its size. The exterior is so sexy, the interior is so beautiful and comfortable. I also feel really proud for investing in a company with a cool ethos!

This community has helped me a lot in narrowing down my choice, and I’m really thankful for y’all! I will try to give back wherever I can 😀"

Farewell 
It breaks my heart to say goodbye.  This community has been so welcoming but I am leaving.  After 6-weeks and 2 rear drive unit replacements, 2 west zone controllers, and 1 east zone controller, Rivian still has not been able to fix my R1S so I had to start the buy back process.

I will most miss the community, the looks and driving of the R1S, and the matrix headlights.  I will not miss the premium sound system, poor reliability, and the parts / service which are completely overwhelmed.

As a shareholder, I hope Rivian starts making investments in the quality of their vehicles and their service network before it is too late.  My biggest regret is not buying a Quad and waiting for the Tri.   Live and learn."

How to speed up the update download?
Is there any way to just force the update to continue once it’s started? I’m going on 4 hours of downloading now. It was stuck at 4% forever, at one port it sped up and got up to 76% downloaded and now just sits there. I’ve restarted the car multiple times and just keeps getting back to “paused” on the update screen with no way to get it going again. This is my first vehicle update and it’s been quite an unpleasant experience so far. It’s bad enough that it seems to need to be on wifi to download (getting the car close to the house to get on wifi is tricky), but once it’s connected if it can’t reliably get the download it doesn’t look like there’s any recourse other than to just wait for it to feel like resuming at some point.

Why Now’s the Perfect Time to Buy a Used Rivian Gen 1

If you’re thinking about picking up a Rivian, let me save you some time: a used Gen 1 R1T or R1S is the way to go right now. Gen 2 is out, but honestly, it’s not that much better, and Gen 1 is hitting its stride. Here’s why:

1. First Owners Already Took the Hits.
Gen 1 had its early quirks (all first-gen tech does), but most of that stuff—recalls, fixes, early hardware tweaks—was handled by the first owners. These trucks have already been sorted out under warranty, which means you’re getting a solid, reliable Rivian without being the guinea pig.

2. Gen 1 Software is Rock Solid.
Rivian has been pumping out over-the-air updates for years now, and Gen 1’s software is super mature: stable driver-assist, great UI, camp modes, range improvements—it just works.

Gen 2? Sure, it has those slick 4K cameras, but owners are already reporting software bugs and optimization issues. Fancy hardware means nothing if the software feels half-baked.

3. Prices Are Finally Reasonable.
Used Rivians were crazy expensive for a while, but prices have finally come down to earth (somewhat). You can grab a used R1T or R1S for way less than what Gen 2 is going for the similar power, and you’re still getting a SUV/truck with insane performance and capability.

4. You’re Not Missing Out on Gen 2.
Okay, Gen 2 has 4K cameras and some tweaks, but let’s be real—that’s not game-changing. Gen 1’s hardware (powertrain, off-road chops, interior quality) is still excellent, and the software is better. Plus, Gen 2 buyers are now dealing with “new model” issues while Gen 1 is proven.

TL;DR: Used Rivian Gen 1s are the smart move right now. First owners worked out the kinks, the software is mature, prices are down, and while Gen 2 has 4K cameras, it’s still ironing out its issues. If you want a Rivian that’s ready to go today, Gen 1 is where it’s at."

Coming from a model Y… will I regret this?
R1T Dual Max Performance with off road package. Really hoping that the issues others have had are representative of a small minority rather than something common! My Y has been very reliable, but I want a vehicle that’s better equipped for my outdoor hobbies (plus I’ve always wanted a Rivian).
🤞"

Question for all, pre-purchase
I’m about to finalize a 3-yr lease tomorrow. I test drove the R1S and loved it. I think the car is so cool and I’m super pumped about it. 

But I see articles saying they are on the bottom of consumer reliability rankings and get nervous bc car issues stress me out unlike any other, bc they always arise at the worst times and I don’t have spare time as it it with a generally very busy lifestyle (and first kid on the way any day!)

Should I be worried or reconsider? Or just do it?"

Gen 1 RST: The Buggiest Vehicle Software I’ve Ever Used
I’ve owned my 2022 R1T for a few months now, and I *want* so badly to love it. But nearly every time I drive, the software lets me down.  
  
I’m curious to hear if others have experienced similar issues or if my truck is particularly problematic. Here’s what I’ve encountered:

* **Uncontrollable HVAC:** No matter what I do, I can’t seem to control the HVAC system. It’s always set to auto, but if it’s 30°F outside, it blows cold air even when set to 70°F. On the flip side, if the cabin is too warm and I lower the auto temp by 10 degrees, it starts blowing even hotter air.
* **Mobile App Connection Issues:** The Rivian app only connects to my R1T about 60% of the time. The rest of the time, it either fails to connect or doesn’t wake the vehicle, leaving me unable to preheat the truck reliably.
* **Highway Assist Disengagements:** Every freeway drive seems to come with at least one random Highway Assist disengagement. It’s sudden and without warning. Sunlight hitting the camera lens? Disengage. Perfectly clear lane markings? Disengage. Slight rain? Disengage. These sudden disengagements have nearly caused me to veer into barriers, especially mid-curve.
* **Screen Auto Brightness Issues:** On sunny days, the screen is so dim I can barely read it. At night, it’s blindingly bright, like it’s set to maximum brightness.
* **Profile and Seat Position Issues:** If my wife gets into the passenger seat before I do, or if she was the last to drive, the seat remains in her position. I often end up banging my knees under the steering wheel. The truck doesn’t reliably switch back to my profile unless I manually intervene.
* **UI Freezes:** On a road trip, the map froze while I was trying to find the closest fast charger, rendering it useless. Annoyingly, you can’t reset the infotainment system (by holding the two outer steering wheel buttons) while driving—you have to stop and put the truck in park.
* **Overly Sensitive Gear Guard:** Whenever I park for more than 30 minutes, I come back to 10+ “events” triggered by passing cars, shadows, or people 20 feet away. It’s become so frequent that I don’t even bother checking the recordings anymore.
* **Soundless Music:** Sometimes, the audio just stops working entirely. It doesn’t matter what the source is (Spotify, radio, etc.) or how the volume is set—there’s just no sound.

  
There's more examples of persistent bugs that are driving me crazy, but I can't bring myself to add to this already-depressing list.  
  
Does this align with other Gen 1 R1T owner experiences? Are these common bugs, or is my R1T particularly unlucky? Would love to hear your thoughts."

DIY Guide: Fixing Door Handle Bar Rattles

Hello everyone,

I wanted to share a quick DIY guide on how to fix some of the rattles in the Rivian door handle bars. After addressing several noise sources, I’ve managed to eliminate most of the rattles on my vehicle. Hope this helps others facing similar issues. This DIY was requested, that's why I am sharing with the community.

What You’ll Need:

Felt Tape
https://amzn.to/4kxkSLj
I picked this specific felt tape because of its ideal thickness. In some spots, I needed to remove the sticky backing and just use the felt. This one allows for easy separation of the adhesive.
Plastic Trim Tools
I used this one: https://amzn.to/4lB0gTi
But if I were buying now, I’d get this set with more tip options: https://amzn.to/3TnY5qe
Different tips help a lot when working in tight or awkward trim areas.
Scissors
Just for trimming the felt to fit small or narrow seams.

Before You Start:

If you have a Gen2 model, the door handle bar plastics are uncoated, which makes the process easier. If you have a Gen1, be more careful—using too much force with trim tools might scratch the coated plastic.

Steps:

Remove the silver plastic trim on the handle bar.
It may look like metal, but it’s actually plastic. Start by gently inserting a trim tool at the top-center area. Once the first section is loose, use a second trim tool to work along the edges and release the clips. The clips are strong and won’t break easily, but be patient.
Apply felt tape to the main rattle points.
These are generally:
Where the wood trim meets hard plastic
Where the silver trim meets hard plastic
Where soft vinyl meets hard plastic
In areas where there’s limited space (especially between soft vinyl and hard plastic), peel off the sticky side and only apply the felt. This prevents buildup that could make reassembly difficult.
Between the wood trim and hard plastic, also remove the adhesive and just use the felt for a cleaner fit.
Use minimal felt. A small amount is mostly sufficient and too much can make panels bulge or feel uneven.
Focus especially on the handle bar area. Some squeaks came from inside seams where different trim parts meet—especially where the upper and side parts of the handle bar join. In some cases, just adding felt where your hand grips the bar was enough to solve most of the issue.
Once you’re done applying felt, test the door by opening, closing, and pressing around the trim areas to simulate movement. If you still hear any noise, adjust or add felt as needed.

Battery warning still there
R1T gen 1, 2022 Launch edition. I have about 97k miles on it and about 4 weeks ago I got the 12 volt battery warning for the third time. Since then I was surviving with the warning till it started affecting my top speed (limited to 50) and would no longer hold and took longer to go into park. Rivian wanted 700 to replace the battery’s for the third time so I decided to just try myself for cheaper. I Just recently replaced both battery’s with Ohmmu 12 volt battery’s and it slightly fixed things. It still takes a little longer to go into park but I can now go higher than 50 mph and it now actually holds. The battery warning is still there and it won’t let me update to 18.30. should the warning go away eventually or what should I do? "

Has anyone else experience this? Rivian service change.
TLDR:I made an appointment for something that seems most certainly an issue that should be covered under warranty, and they want me to sign off on possibly paying 400$+ if they decide it’s not covered. My last service also had issues that needed to be seen and they said it should be under warranty no pay unless it’s a problem you caused. Has anyone else experience this? 

Put the TLDR first cause realized I may be rambling and if people just wanna know about why I’m posting this I’ll just put the TLDR first.


So my infotainment screen GPS started acting up, it went into “NighMode” during he day and wouldn’t show my my directions on the big screen. I still could see the turn by turn on the driver screen in the little window, but the big screen would go into and out. It also wouldn’t follow the car so sometimes it would still show on the map where I started the route. So I hit my name on the display and wrote down the time and date and just went on with my drive. I got home and did a soft reset(I forgot if that’s what it’s called). It fixed it, but I was already home. FF the next morning same issue came back. I was late to work so I reset it on my way back from work later that day. Next morning same issues. I did the same time stamp thing and reset. Around the 3rd or 4th time of this happening I finally submitted a ticket. Went through the mobile service request and set an appointment two weeks later( earliest they could get me in). Next day I get a msg saying unfortunately this problem is not something we can fix with a mobile service you must bring it into a service center. So it took me some time to get around to it but a few days later I made an appointment for an in service center day. Then the next day I get a push notification to review an estimate approval for 447$. I contacted the Customer Service and they said that’s their new practice. Idk if I’m wrong but i feel that if it’s something like what I stated above which sounds like either a bug in software or a glitch, why they won’t just consider it a warranty claim and let me know there is a possibility that it could turn into self pay if it turns out to be something I somehow caused?"

First update and it’s a no-go.
Just took possession of my Gen 2 R1T a few weeks ago and I’m away from home thru the weekend. Update is available but cannot connect to traditional WiFi where I am. It seems to have started and now says “Paused” with a Connect to WiFi button next to it. No matter what I do, my truck won’t recognize my iPhone either (and I’ve even changed the name to get rid of special characters, which I understand from u/riviantrackr was an issue 9 months ago but I think they’ve corrected). supposedly, it should be able to do a download thru the built-in Connect+ but it’s not. I’ve done a soft reset, but not a hard reset. Nothing’s working. Thinking I should punt and just wait till I get home but still perplexed why my iPhone won’t connect. I just get “Connection Failure” when I type it in directly.  I think I might have multiple unrelated issues. :-( "

Considering Used 2022 R1T. Is this worth it?
I'm considering buying a 2022 R1T Adventure Package with 45,000 miles. The best price I’ve been able to get from a third-party dealer is $51,800. It’s the Limestone exterior with the Ocean Coast interior, and it appears to be in excellent condition.

With the Gen 2 models now released, I’m wondering if we’ll start seeing more Gen 1s entering the used market. I’m new to Rivian, so I’d love to hear any thoughts or advice.

For context, this won’t be my first EV. I've previously owned a Model 3 and currently drive a Ford Lightning. Looking to make the switch to Rivian next."

I will start by saying that I love my R1T, it’s an amazing vehicle, even if it’s not an exceptional truck (compared to a typical half ton variety). Almost everything about the vehicle is truly a joy. I’m a major advocate and fanboy. 

With that said… I cannot believe how terrible the proximity unlock, and the ability to just get into the vehicle has been over the past year. For a three month stretch I was only able to use the key card, which is fine if not, really annoying. For the past six weeks my proximity unlock with my phone has been so bad that I’ve been stuck in the rain at least a half dozen times fumbling to find the key card in my wallet so I can get into the vehicle drenched while I figure out that the car won’t open no matter what I do with touching the handle or waving the phone. 

To add insult to injury, I’ve dropped my phone three different times with my hands full of children and other things expecting my car to open. I’ve literally never dropped my phone more than once an entire ownership period of a couple years per phone cycle upgrade in the past. I have a great schedule of handing my devices down to my family as I upgrade because my phone stay in pristine condition, but I’ll have to buy a new phone for my parents due to the abuse that this one has seen due to my inability to pull the phone out of my pocket to access the app to unlock the car so that I can get inside before I’m completely soaked to the bone, or just to placate screaming children, etc. 

I’ve said this before, and I come from the industry so I have empathy here, but the QA work on the releases for critical functionality is remarkably bad.  

I have an iPhone within the latest two releases, which I would guess makes up at least 80% of their audience, and I can’t get into my vehicle, which is the latest release that they have. That is mind blowing to me. 

And, before anyone lashes out, I have done all of the cycling through of logging in logging out, resetting on both ends and even spoken to Rivian themselves. Kind, but useless. 

Part of what I love about the Rivian is how the cars made, and the impressive zone architecture and software focus, but I would be a complete liar if I ignored that getting into the car… One of the most basic things you can do… is abysmal."

Working on a camp kitchen
Working on a camp kitchen cooking setup and picked up this little number for my induction stove. I have a butane-powered version of this that I would like to start phasing out now that I got the truck. This one has the benefit of looking like it will do fine being moved around and, most importantly, sized appropriately for the R1T to 1500W. I had previously planned on the ikea induction, which is also portable and around the same price, but it’s rated to $1875 watts, and I don’t want to worry about tripping the breaker (which several video reviews suggested they did with what I suspect was the ikea one). I didn’t want two burner options because they’re big and we won’t commonly use two anyway. My plan is to still bring the second butane one as backup if I need two, and if I pull it out often, I’ll reconsider getting a two burner. We also have a butane griddle we’ll keep in the rotation for now that will work well for bacon, burgers, hot dogs, etc. 

I’ve considered all of the purpose-built kitchens that go in the gear tunnel, on the back of the truck, on a table, and rivian’s recent $1400 thing, and they either seemed like a lot of money, too restrictive with how they took up space in the truck, or both. And taking rivian’s offering as an example, it’s nice and small and does a lot of what you want. But it’d still quite limited (e.g., I’m going to have a sync and pump-actuated water tap in my version), and it still costs a lot more than what I’ll end up spending.

My plan is to go with the snow peak IGT setup and customize it myself. My first pass is going to get me a full setup for under $600 and be very high quality/give me a ton of functionality with the added benefit of flexibility. Plus, I get to customize a ton going the IGT route, instead of being restricted to the purpose-built solution that someone else made. I’ll build some modules myself for fun :-)

Please proceed to comment on how genius this plan is, or mercilessly poke holes in it. "

Car won’t start with phone as key
New owner of an R1S. Came over from a 2018 Tesla X that I had for almost 8 years.

So far I’m happy with the car but we just ran into an issue that’s pretty frustrating. My wife is using her phone as a key. She’s the secondary user. She drove the car this AM to work. At the end of the day got in the car to drive home (her dad gone unlocks the car fine) and when she gets in the car it won’t start. She’s putting the phone on the center console and the car just won’t recognize it. We’ve tried everything - restarting the phone, the car (both types of restarts). We called support and they said they have seen an issue with secondary keys but was vague. They are currently pushing a forced sleep? She’s supposed to try it again in an hour. She’s been dealing with this for almost 3 hours.

Anyone experience this before and have suggestions? With less than 1000 miles in I hope this is not a regular occurrence. 

Also - She’s an hour away and we need the car again tomorrow. If it won’t start she will need to take an uber home and back again in the morning. When asked about uber reimbursement the agent said they couldn’t approve that. "

Dead Pedal Extension
I designed an extension for the dead pedal. It raises the pedal by about 1.25” and really does make it more comfortable.  This project started a while ago, but then I got stuck and never finished it (needed a good way to attach it).

Recently, TWRAPS posted that they just launched their own version and it got me motivated to finish my 3d printed one.  I suggest you try out the TWRAPS version as it looks pretty nice. If you are inclined to 3d print your own, though, mine is available on printables. That said, I realize now that my design likely won’t fit well if you have all-weather mats. I think I’ll update the design to at least accommodate the OEM mats, so stay tuned for that.

Car won’t turn off ……
For the last week my car won’t shut off, leaving music , ac and screens on all the time if not manually turned off ( except the screens) .

Have been on the phone with Rivian Service several times and hard reset the car, but no bueno. All the trouble started when I received error messages on the seat heater, because they wouldn’t shut off. After the reset the error messages cleared but car won’t shut off. 

After trouble shooting it looks like an issue with the driver seat contact . Can’t get into SC but have mobile scheduled on the 19th. Did anyone have this issue?"

RJ interview in Irvine standard
RJ Scaringe was 26 years old and just one day out of graduate school at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) when he founded the company he would later call Rivian. That was in 2009 - at the height of a historic recession.
Eleven years later, Scaringe moved the company to Irvine - and then took it public amid a global pandemic.
Since then, Rivian, which makes high-tech electric trucks and SUVs, has endured serial supply-chain crises and a vexingly slow buildout of U.S. charging infrastructure.
Yet, through it all, Scaringe has maintained his focus.

Owned Tesla. Leased Rivian. Back to Tesla. Wishing them the best but not quite there in my opinion.
Traded my Model S for an R1S and want to start by saying I’m a fan of Rivian and this isn’t a Tesla > Rivian post. You can enjoy both lol. I really loved it at first and think Rivian offers a uniquely capable vehicle and experience that you won’t get with others, but just need some expectations set going in. I started to have constant issues with quality and service within first few months of ownership - AC went out, windshield was misaligned and not set properly, suspension issues - to where it was spending more time in service than I was driving. People like to hate on Tesla for their quality but honestly had more issues with the Rivian in 5 months than I have in owning 4 Tesla’s previously combined. Maybe just luck of the draw, know a lot of people have had zero issues so maybe this post isn’t for you. 

I was warned about the tech being a step behind Tesla but I didn’t realize how big that gap actually was. Couldn’t understand why I near $100k car had such a lackluster UI performance and the lag that occur when switching apps in the infotainment. The autopilot/driver assist was reallly bad at times on the highway to where it caused some near collisions pulling the car into the next lane and swaying back and forth. I get that’s not Rivian’s primary focus for these cars but maybe it should be for atleast the immediate future. Charging speeds and efficiency were another pain - didn’t realize this until I took a longer road trip and immediately missed the ease and efficiency that Tesla provides. Spent probably 20-30% more time charging the Rivian in total than I would’ve in the Tesla, which on a longer trip is a lot. The last thing was how loud the cabin on this thing was driving with any type of speed, sounded like you were in a wind tunnel. I know a lot are coming from Tesla to Rivian and I’m all for that honestly, but it wasn’t the best fit for me. Test drove the new Model Y and immediately ordered it and it’s been a night and day experience for me. Crazy quiet cabin and butter smooth ride, amazing UI speed, FSD, tons of cargo space still. Sticking to what I know for now but hopefully in a few years I’ll give the R2 a shot when some of these things are worked out. Until next time ✌️ "

R2 timeline?
Not sure of anyone from Rivian is here but I would love to hear some feedback around reservations on R2. I booked mine back in March 2024 and currently driving a Tesla model 3 that’s coming up on the 4yr warranty at the end of the year. Also given the current political situation I know 10-15 Tesla owners(in my circle) eagerly waiting for the R2 :) I’m at a dilemma where I don’t know if I should pay extra $2400 to Tesla to get that added warranty since I don’t know when in 2026 I will get the R2 plus I’m in Canada so I might not be prioritized and tariffs might come into play; and push the R2 over 70/75k which will make it not affordable to me :(

It would be really cool if Rivian can predict the timeline based on the reservation number? It won’t be accurate but with +/- 3month accuracy would be cool? just a thought:)

Very excited for you guys and you’ll get a ton of Tesla owners jumping onto the R2. Specially in Canada since the R1s are pretty expensive here (base std starting at 117k without taxes etc)

Ski Rack Saga/Comedy
TL:dr ski rack purchased from Rivian was defective, they keep trying to get other companies to refund me even though I paid Rivian for the bum rack. 

Bought our R1S in fall of 2023 along with cross bars and the Yakima Evo 6 rack. We didn’t have a need to use the ski rack until this winter so cross bars and rack were boxed and stored until now. When we took the ski rack out of the box, the screw in one of the clamps was broken so the rack couldn’t attach. Reached out to Rivian January 6th 2025 which started this saga of 20ish phone calls and emails. Rivian couldn’t replace the part. Took a few emails and phone calls for them to convey this. They couldn’t decide if I should go in person to the dealership or not.  Then they punted me to Yakima. Yakima didn’t have the part (lots of back and forth here while they tried to locate one) so they tell me to return the rack to Rivian if I can’t wait until May for the part (they did end some other parts that didn’t work for me.) No big deal, REI had one of the racks and we are several ski weekends into the ordeal at this point riding with skis wedged inside with us or begging others to schlep our gear. 

Bought the rack at REI and now I am ready to return the defective rack get a refund from Rivian who are still trying to say it’s a Yakima warranty issue and so Yakima should issue the refund. Yakima says only Rivian can process the refund since I paid Rivian for the rack. Rivian just won’t do it because they still think it’s a warranty issue. The annoying thing is that because they close out the inquiries as “resolved” as soon as they think they are done, there is no continuity and I start at the beginning each time. At one point, a Rivian tech suggested I return the broken rack to REI to get my refund. Aside: since rei is a co-op, was that him telling me screw you? 

My husband and I switched owner/driver profiles during one of the many customer service phone calls so I could handle more of the back and forth about this stupid rack AT THEIR recommendation. Which brings me to the latest response which was today. They told me the ticket was closed and resolved because it appears I am not the original owner and refunds can only issued to the original owner and they again suggested I call Yakima warranty department. 

I will admit that we should have opened the box and tested all parts right away BUT when everyone is lemoning out these cars, the ski rack was not as concerning as the 12v or the actual car turtling. It’s unbelievable how many hours I have spent chasing a $360 refund but it was adjacent to a $90k purchase so…

Hopefully a Rivian employee can add a little plea for my sanity during the morning prayer where they thank all gods for Elon losing his mind. No way that is not a company-wide practice at this point.  "

Overland/Stargazing Astrnomy Setup underway
Started building a camping rig that allows me to setup my telescopes with ease while camping and smoking up some bbq at the time! 

I got the Rivian tent and awning over the weekend and the travel kitchen as well. I’m also working on integrating a Traeger ranger into the gear sled for some BBQ’ing. A month or so ago I had my telescope setup on the truck bed and it worked well but the vibrations from the loud gen2 heat pump distorted the images. So now I’ll be setting it up on the ground but still have it all powered by the truck and have the ikamper setup with iPad screens as my command center to control it all. Also lined the interior with black out material so the screens won’t affect my imaging or those of folks imaging near by. "

Phone key not working – “Tap key on tray, no key found” even after all troubleshooting steps
Hey Rivian community,

I’m having ongoing issues with my phone key. The vehicle keeps displaying: “Tap key on tray, no key found.” Even though I have my phone key set up and with me, the car just won’t recognize it.

Here’s what I’ve already tried:

Restarted the Rivian app

Verified Bluetooth is on and working

Deleted and re-paired the phone key

Performed a hard reset of the infotainment system

Checked all app permissions (Bluetooth, Location, etc.)

Ensured the phone was close to the tray when trying to start

Made sure the app is up to date


Despite all this, the issue persists. It used to work fine, but now it's totally unreliable. I’d really appreciate any suggestions or if anyone has experienced this and found a fix.

Thanks in advance!

Key cards not working
Update: fixed - turns out the key cards would show on the app but not on the car itself. Called Rivian again, they worked some magic and a couple hours later, both working again! Thanks all. Leaving original post here if anyone else has the same issue. 

Wondering if anyone can shed a light: picked up my new R1S this Wednesday! At the service center they unlocked the car with a key card and guided me to set up my phone as a key. Since then, none of the key cards worked again (which I only realized after getting home). 

Key cards won’t lock or unlock and won’t start the car in the console (key not found). I tried un-assigning and reassigning them in the app and rebooting the system. Nothing, no sign of life. Called them and next appointment is May or maybe something earlier but the SC is an hour away anyways. Anyone have any ideas? Btw: the compressor works! (I’ve read something about a blown fuse). "

iPhone won’t pair after service center visit
Just got my 2025 R1S back from the service center. It was only there for some small cosmetic issues in the interior. 

When I got in an alert popped up saying no key detected so I used the card and was on my way thinking that it was just a glitch since I haven’t used it in a week. 

Later on it still wasn’t working so i started troubleshooting and reset everything and now my phone won’t even pair. I’ve seen some similar issues on here and have tried pretty much everything suggested. Any ideas?

Things I’ve tried: soft reset, hard reset, deleting phone key, deleting Rivian app, rebooting phone, testing in different phone. "

Climate Control?
Why can’t the climate settings just start with the previous set up? I get out of my car for 3 minutes to go do something and I have to reset the whole thing. Toggle on heated seat and steering wheel, turn on the rear floor vents because the front ones won’t work if the rears aren’t on, toggle off and on the vents I want which includes passenger vents off. Seems like this would be an easy software fix for those who want the vehicle to start with the previous setup. I’m running around as a realtor in and out of my vehicle often and this is incredibly annoying! "

“Unlock” not responding from app
Is anyone else experiencing an issue where the car won’t unlock when using the app? This started for me first thing this morning. I can still preheat the car through the app, but when I press “unlock,” it doesn’t actually unlock—it just keeps making the locking sound on the car. For now, I’ve had to switch to using the key card.

Stay safe out there in the cold!
I was in the Catskills with 12 miles left on my drive and 45 on the battery so I thought it was fine. Didn’t take into account I’d be going up a mountain and it was 20degF. The miles started ticking off like crazy. Like 3-4 miles of battery for every mile travelled. I tuned the heat off and went into conserve mode. No good. With 5 miles left to travel, the battery went down to 15 miles to go and went into limp mode. Down to 30mph, then 10, then 1 mile an hour then I pulled over. Ended up getting towed by a buddy the last 3 miles and coasting down a hill to my charger at the house with zero miles left.

Hint: if you go into park with zero miles it won’t let you go into neutral, you have to disable it in the service menu to let it think you’re being towed onto a flatbed. Even then you can’t coast over 8 miles an hour otherwise it automatically engages the parking brake."

Key issues 


Since my GEN1 Rivian came back from service, I've been experiencing some odd key issues. It started Monday morning when I was getting ready for school. I had my phone, fob, and key card, with the app open and the fob charged, but my car showed a ""no key"" message.

I tried locking and unlocking the car with the fob, closing and reopening the app, but nothing worked. Eventually, it only recognized the key card, which I had never used until now. The only time it was used was when a tow truck driver picked up my car for service; he struggled with the fob and said he only knew how to use the card.

Now, the problem is hit or miss; sometimes it works, and other times it won’t unlock as I approach. All keys are still registered in the settings.

Has anyone encountered this issue? Any solutions would be appreciated!

——— 

**TL;DR:** After service, my GEN1 Rivian has been having intermittent key issues. Sometimes it won’t recognize my fob or phone, only the key card, which I’ve never used until now. The tow driver had trouble with the fob and mentioned he only knew how to use the card. Has anyone else faced this? Any tips?"

Advice for first-time buyer??
Hi all, and with apologies if this is already collected somewhere, but I’m looking for any/all “pro tips” on buying (or, more likely in my case, leasing) a Rivian R1S.

As background, we are a family of 6 (kiddos are 8, 11, 13 and 15) and are coming from a 2017 Honda Odyssey “Touring” which we bought new in 2016 and is really starting to show its age.  Seems like a Rivian R1S is the only EV option for us. Wife is scheduling us for a test drive at our local dealership this Friday.

We live in a dense semi-urban area just outside Chicago (northern Midwest, so cooooold winters, and our garage is detached and un-heated) and are a one-car family (both my wife and I work mostly from home).  We put about 55K miles on the Odyssey since 2016.  The longest road trip we ever took was 600 miles (one time…and probably won’t go that far again).  More typical road trip for us is once/year 200 miles.  Mostly, the car is an errand-runner (groceries, kids to school, occasional 1-hour drive out to the ‘burbs, etc.).

We have zero delusions of off-roading and the most “truck” thing I do is weekend warrior trips to Home Depot (but usually have them deliver larger loads when I get into some serious construction projects).

We do like “loaded” vehicles (hence the “Touring” edition Odyssey), and our current “loaded” standard is heated/cooled seats, heated steering wheel, nice in-dash nav, and Apple Car Play (I understand this is not available on the Rivian…).  We put a Class 3 hitch on the Odyssey for our Yakima bike rack and a basket outrigger that we sometimes use, but we never tow anything.

With all that as background….let me know what you’d do if you were in my shoes.

Buy vs. Lease?  I’ve never leased, always bought outright, but I feel like this is a car that we won’t want to own (or will want to upgrade) at the end of the 3-year period. 

Which spec level, given my background above?  I’m more concerned about under-spec’ing than over-spec’ing, and I usually get top of the line, but I can be convinced to ratchet that back if there are obvious inefficiencies in the top-of-the-line model.

Any must-have/must-avoid options we should consider?

We will probably install a fast-charger in our garage (which, again, is detached and unheated).  Any advice here?

Any trim/paint/rim options to avoid?

Any negotiation tips?  I get the sense that there is zero room for negotiation on these…but I’m very comfortable (respectfully) negotiating if there is any room on price, options, service, etc.  (For what it’s worth, our local Honda dealers are absolutely salivating over our Odyssey and we get weekly calls/emails trying to buy it, lol.)

Anything else?  I’m all ears, and would appreciate benefiting from the group’s collective wisdom.

Thank you all in advance!

30 Days In: HELP!
Need your help! I purchased a beautiful 2022 Rivian R1T Quad from Texas some time ago in September and finally got it in early November. I traded in a Genesis GV60 which was phenomenal but needed something bigger. Have no regrets about this but here are the little issues I have so far and need your help to maybe find a solution if you’ve experienced this before:

- Meridian Audio: Sounds like a dream! Just as good as the B&O on my GV60, but sounds like a rattle in my rear passenger door speaker. Did anyone have this happen? Will rivian just replace it?

- Truck Bed Storage: I find it hard to close the under bed storage door. Is this something I should get used to where I have to go back and push down ok whichever latch didn’t lock (usually right latch) or is this something I should address?

- Gear Tunnel Door: Since the weather got colder in the 30 days I’ve had it, it’s started squeaking and makes me not want to open it in parking lots! Last thing I want is for me to be driving this beast every day and then someone look over and hear my door squeak like a 1997 Saab… any solutions?

- Rattles!!!: EVERYWHERE! My 3 main rattles that I need addressed and hope you’ve dealt with and fixed before are a rattle in the large mesh metal cover thing in the center dashboard. If I hold it, is stops rattling but it’s like a tapping sound. The second is a very faint but rapid rattling noise in the driver b-pillar by the seatbelt, almost like a clicking sound. And lastly! Worst of all… a loud rattle coming from the rear passenger corner that I can’t find the source of, it’s like a knocking sound that won’t go away almost like what my old Genesis G80 did when they had to replace the sunroof track but this car only had a glass panel, I don’t know if it’s from the door or the roof or even behind the rear passenger seat but it’s driving me crazy… any thoughts?

- Rubbing sounds: This is more minute but the seats make this rubbing sound against the divider plastic in the back when you’re in the seat… the steering wheel does the same thing with the sponge underneath when I do easy access. I had to disable because I would feel embarrassed when I’d have my co workers get in and all of a sudden it sounds like a balloon being rubbed against front he steering wheel. Easy solution or do I need to involve rivian too?

- Windshield: My luck… I cracked my windshield already when a truck threw back a rock on the highway, unrepairable. Anyone ever replaced a windshield and if so, what did it cost ya? (Does anyone have recommendations of a windshield warranty contract… this will be my 3rd in 1 year…)

- Lastly… the driver seat storage door keeps I clipping from the sides of the from panel cover and just hangs outward. Rivian too?

Please let me know your thoughts! I love this truck and just want to make it perfect!!"

Update 2700 miles later on gen 1 R1T
I’ve put in 2700 miles. I’ll put this in categories. By this point the new car is almost gone but to this day it’s still a happy transition. 

Purchased in August 2024,
Model: 2023 quad adventure package AT with Rivian elevation. Current does not have a tonneau cover. Supposedly may come with one in the future. 
Came from a model 3 2018 long range enhanced autopilot now with 96k miles. 

The things I love: 

It drives like a champ: obviously hard to compare a 54k car at the time to a EV truck but like I’ve said before they did a phenomenal job making this vehicle feel smaller than its 7k+ lbs weight. 


Acceleration: no truck should accelerate like this. I love it every time. I use it as a daily driver to work. And I can’t help but enjoy that power. Can’t wait for actual launch mode in 2025. 

Space: May it be the lack of a trunk, but I have enjoyed using the frunk and the gear tunnel. This is in comparison to the frunk on my Model 3, which I probably use 2-3 times a year. 

Off-roading: It is fun as hell. It puts many other vehicles to shame. I’ve taken it 2-3 times off-roading, and I can trust to be able to handle easy-moderate trails without a hitch. 

Things that need improvement: 

Software: Rivian is playing catch-up. It makes no sense to me that my software 2.5 TM3, which has more software that I don’t use, has a significantly better responsiveness than Rivian. Nor does it make sense that we don’t have the capability to merge lanes by themselves. Nor the ability to back out of a parking space by themselves using your phone. At its current iteration, we are at least 2 years behind, and it will only get worse with the gen 2’s better computer hardware. I think the only way to remedy this is to have a computer hardware upgrade at some point. 

Fit and finish: between the two, it’s no comparison that the Rivian is made better. However, I’m starting to have sounds of all kinds happening after 1k miles. The HVAC sounds like a lawn blower when it’s hot, I hear a whistling sound when driving at highway speeds, I can’t tell if it’s a window or just the electric noise. The air suspension is noticeably louder on bumps than when I first got it. The auto wiper stays on even though the windshield is completely dry. One of the doors sounds weird when you close it compared to the other 3. Now, you would think for a 70k+ vehicle, these things wouldn’t happen. The worst part is that service is so backed up, I’m concerned that if I get these things serviced, I won’t see my truck for several weeks or months. 

Now do I have any regrets, hell no! I’m so done with Tesla. They support the removal of 7500 credit which they know would only hurt all other EV makers. How is that make sense. So much for supporting the transition as long as it was benefiting their company. In short, I am biased on Rivian succeeding. I have R2 pre ordered and I cannot wait to get it as it is likely a better comparison to my TM3. The R2 is the TM3 moment for Tesla. It’s the make or break for Rivian. If it fails, they will likely not survive. So they really need this to work. "

App won’t establish connection with R1S
With the Halloween update (or around that time), my app won’t establish a connection with the vehicle. I can’t remote unlock, start climate control or view live cams. I do have Connect+. I’ve tried the hard reset multiple times, restarting iPhone. Anyone have a fix? "

Another garage door opener bites the dust
So it finally happened to me. Again. My Rivian won’t show my garage door openers on my quick access panel. I’m on the Halloween update. I’ve tried a hard and soft reset. Tried adding and removing both my home location and the location of the garage door openers. In every order I could think of. Is there something I’m missing? How do you get this thing to work again? I’m really starting to get tired of Rivian software quality."

Getting a dead Riv off a tow truck
Hi all,

Bit of a strange question, but I don’t seem to be able to find a ton of people who’ve asked this so I thought I’d ask.

I’m a new Rivian R1S owner. Without getting into specifics, the airbag went off and I think the pyro fuse has gone off causing the entire vehicle to die. It’s getting dropped off at my house in the next couple of days and I’m worried I won’t be able to get it off the tow truck. Here’s a few ideas I’ve come up with, but please let me know if you have any others:

* Vehicle tire dollies: My first idea is to jack up the rear tires (since, to my knowledge, they'll be the only ones locked) and place rolling dollies under them and then push/pull it off.
* Release parking brake: I don't seem to have found much on this subject, but my presumption, is that if I can hook 12V of power up to the rear parking brake motor, which will cause it to retract and release the tires. Does anyone have any experience doing that? I've seen people do it on Teslas and to my knowledge it's the same system on Rivians.

Cheers

EDIT: Okay, we seem to be getting a lot of comments here from people who aren't mechanically-inclined - which is cool! Any ideas are welcome, even silly ones! But please, don't start belittling me, or others, if you have absolutely no idea what you're talking about. We're getting a lot of confidently incorrect people, who seem to think you can can jump a 12V battery to bypass a Pyrofuse. It would defeat the entire point of it existing if you could do that. Obviously, totally fine if you're just throwing out suggestions, we welcome it, but don't condescendingly explaining principles to people here if you are completely wrong. There's no shame in taking a back seat, or accepting that you might not know something."

Pretty livid about no Spotify without Connect+….
How do you sell me something with the car, and a pretty basic feature at that just mapping Spotify content…. Then start charging me $15/mo to use that previously free feature that was never advertised as paid in future….

The first really negative sentiment I’ve had toward this brand.

I won’t be paying for Connect+ — so result = no revenue for Rivian, and significant drop in NPS from me….

Help me with that logic? Hope they reverse this…

My experience of the purchase and early ownership of a Blue 2025 R1S Dual Max.
There have been a ton of folks who have walked through their experiences already but I know that as a buyer looking around, I was still grateful for new posts detailing their experience and so here is mine.

**Background:** My reservation was from Sept 2022 and I was eligible to configure and pickup a '24 model in March. I configured a model and was notified for a pickup but I had punted on it at that point since the timing didn't personally work for me. Post the '25 model update, I had to cancel my configured reservation and reserve again to be able to pick a '25 model. I had done this sometime in August. A Rivian rep reached out in a week or two trying to help me match with inventory/shop vehicles and I ended up finding what I wanted (only addition that I wasn't looking for being the chilewich mats). 

**Purchase experience**: I was contacted by a Rivian agent, towards the end of Sept, that the vehicle is assigned and will be ready for pick-up in a week. The web portal process was fairly smooth for me, once the purchase(and financing steps) opened up there. I was initially hoping to trade-in my car but pulled back on that. The process of uploading the needed documents was all fairly straightforward. Rivian had the 2.99% financing rate which I took advantage of and getting qualified and approved for that was easy too. I did look at Rivian insurance but found it to be very expensive compared to the quote I had from my existing provider(AAA). Also, during this period, Rivian had started the F&F program and I was able to have the $2500 discount applied which was a nice chunk of saving. Beyond this, I e-signed all the contracts up front and confirmed that I was clear for delivery/pickup. I have seen folks talk about not signing until pickup etc. but I had to travel 3 hours to pickup at Eastvale (CA) and honestly didn’t want to risk not being able to do so because of incomplete paperwork.

**Pickup experience:** As I picked up from the Eastvale service center. Lots of deliveries happening on that day since it was really close to the 9/30 date on which they had a number of offers expiring. I was slightly disappointed by the service center itself since the lounge and reception staff lacked warmth and welcome. The lounge is very sparse compared to what folks have posted about other places and even my own experience at the El Segundo center. There was not even readily accessible drinking water and you had to ask the staff who would bring out a cup of water from inside. I am obviously nit-picking here but Rivian has set itself higher standards. I had to wait for about 30mins before my pickup guide was able to take me to my R1S. He asked if I had done a demo ride before, which I did, and so didn’t bother to do detailed walkthrough but gave me time to walk around and inspect the vehicle. He said if there were any issues he could either possibly have it taken care of immediately or can create a ticket for it. Having read a ton of posts and seen many YouTube videos around what to look for, I wanted to be thorough but also knew I cannot go overboard. I spent about 30 mins walking around and noting minor things like - shipping stickers not being peeled off properly, a very minor scratch (that he buffed out) etc. Overall there weren’t any issues that I felt needed a service ticket or even immediate fixing. I logged into the app and confirmed final handover of the vehicle and was ready to go. While the guide left at this point, I took my time to get everything setup before I rolled out. In summary, the pickup experience was smooth and I did not run into any panel alignment issues etc.

**Early observations:** I won’t go through in detail about all the aspects of the vehicle that so many folks have already covered but will only focus on things that stood out to me personally.

   1. Even though I didn’t get the air compressor option, it was a pleasant surprise that a standalone air compressor was included in the frunk.
   2. Some posts had mentioned that the 3rd row side arm cubbies were removed as part of cost optimization but these are still there, at least for now. I mentioned this to the guide and he said heard this too but had no idea at what point in the timeline these changes kicked in.
   3. I really appreciate the blind spot video on the driver screen but I need to get used to how busy the screen gets when the turn signal is on. I find myself trying to balance between checking the mirrors, warning light on the mirrors and the blind spot video.
   4. I knew the R1S is going to be a climb even at low/kneel but it still surprised me and more so the kids. I really wish they had an in-house solution for this rather than me having to drill holes in panels and assemble my own sliders.
   5. Drive and ride quality has been great but I had to already do a couple of soft reboots because of random warnings and signals that popped up. I am understanding this something I will have to get used to with Rivian.
   6. Highway assist+ is great…when it consistently works. I am able to enable it on most of the freeways that I drive on but it seems to intermittently disable itself. Another issue that I find with it is that it seems to occasionally make very last minute corrections on even slightly curvy lanes and is pretty unsettling to both myself as well as anyone in the lane next to me. For this reason, I feel that I cannot really rely on it and feel more nervous with it enabled and if there are vehicles in adjacent lanes. I am really hoping this gets better through OTA updates. I have driven rental Fords and Nissans with adaptive cruise control and lane centering that were way better than this. I feel like Rivian needs to really raise their acceptability bar on this.
   7. I don’t really have huge issues with UI responsiveness and features. Things can be smoother sure but doesn’t impact usability by much. There is definitely a lot going on through all the screens and settings and takes a bit to get your head wrapped around it all and understand what settings and modes make sense for you.
   8. Audio. I am not an audiophile and just need my music/audio to be clear and loud enough when I need it. I got the premium audio and I generally feel like it does its job. 
   9. Kids love it!

**Accessories**: Just a short note on what accessories I have added since I know this was something I was always curious about.

1. I bought an organizer insert for the center space that can hold bottles/cups etc. I felt this really helps that space rather than just being a big empty space where everything can roll around.
2. Added an organizer insert in the center console so I don’t have to constantly fish for things down that blackhole.
3. Screen protectors for all the displays
4. An external hard drive so I can enable the Drive Cam
5. 2nd row seat covers that are made for pets. I have two young kids so essentially the same level of care or concern they have towards making a mess.
6. Seat back protectors for both driver and passenger side. Again, kids.
7. I do want to add the rock sliders but I am not sure if I want to go through the process of making holes/cuts etc.

Hope this is helpful to a few folks. Feel free to DM or comment if you need more specific details/feedback.

Spotify handoff
Hoping someone can explain a solution to my Spotify problem.  I am a longtime Apple Music and Apple Podcast user who grudgingly started using Spotify because of Rivian’s lack of CarPlay.  Now that Apple Music is available I am still using Spotify because Apple’s Podcast app is not available on Connect+.  Anyway, I work out at home early in the morning and will often listen to a podcast using Spotify on my iPhone.  Later on when I get in the Rivian to  go to work, it automatically starts to play the podcast I last listened to.  However, I usually like to listen to music during my drive so I go to playlists on the Rivian screen, select my playlist and hit the play button but it won’t do anything.  I can’t figure out how to deal with this.  I go to my phone and close the Spotify app and it doesn’t help make my Playlist play.  I try to play the playlist from my phone and it starts to play on the device and not through the Rivian.  I end up fumbling around between the phone and the car for the first 10 minutes of my drive trying to get my playlist to play.  Usually the only thing that works is if I select a different podcast on the car screen, it will start to play the new podcast, and then I can select the playlist on the car screen, and it will finally start to play.  The handoff from phone to CarPlay is pretty seamless so I can’t understand why it’s such a challenge with the Rivian.  Is there something I’m doing wrong?"

1,500 Mile towing roadtrip, detailed writeup. Luck was on our side!
Just wrapped up a 1,500 mile roadtrip towing a 23’ travel trailer. 9 nights and 4 locations. 10 DCFC stops with no hiccups and never needing to unhook the trailer in order to charge. Also, 3 days before the trip my official NACS adapter arrived. I have the A2Z but a bitter more piece of mind for any warranty issues using the official one. Couldn’t have asked for better luck!

I decided to do a pretty big writeup as reading others helped me plan and figure out how to make this trip a success. Details below!

2022 Rivian R1T Quad, 20"" ATs. Large Battery.

Big disclaimer here, I have 2 kids, a 7 week old and an almost 3 year old. For those parents out there, you know that means I have to stop often for bottle feeds and diaper changes. That means my plan was to pick chargers that were \*hopefully\* trailer friendly as well as spaced appropriately for bottles for my youngest. Our friends that were with us have a 3 month old and a dog FWIW.

I rented the trailer for a great price at $65/night (FB Marketplace find), which means I didn’t get to test out efficiency prior to the trip. After seeing what others have been getting, I decided to go with 1.1 kWh/mi as a conservative estimate. I ended up getting better efficiency, so I wasn’t shy of the skinny pedal after the first couple legs with speeds 65-73 while towing (allegedly). As we all know, efficiency is dominated by aero, and this trailer is only 7ft wide which is likely a big contributor to the better efficiency than typical 7.5 of 8ft wide trailers.

Happy to report, the entire trip we never were waiting on the truck to charge, and often arrived with 40-90 miles of range left.

This is the original ABRP plan vs. what actually happened. Keep in mind the first leg of the trip on my way to Perris to pick up the trailer I obviously outperformed the estimate and got there something like 84%. We never were waiting on the truck to charge and it was always taking care of kids that took the longest. There was also a road closure on the 395, although that detour wouldn’t have changed any of the charging plans.

Travel day 1: from Perris to Morro Bay we made 3 stops:

1: [https://www.plugshare.com/location/519708](https://www.plugshare.com/location/519708) Tesla Supercharger site - was less than half full, but was able to charge and didn’t block anyone. The EVgo next to it was full with a line.

2: [https://www.plugshare.com/location/268411](https://www.plugshare.com/location/268411) Tesla Supercharger site - Got REALLY lucky with this spot. The exact charger and neighboring parking spots were all open. It was well over 105 degrees, and we went to eat at the habit burger in this parking lot. The restaurant was packed with a line and the AC in the restaurant could only get the place down to what must have been the 80’s.

3: [https://www.plugshare.com/location/617971](https://www.plugshare.com/location/617971) Tesla Supercharger site - Our original plan was to stop by Solvang, but it was 102 which would have been miserable for both infants, the dog and everyone else for that matter. We ended up stopping at this nearly brand new v4 (3.5) Supercharger site. I had to block one stall, but I was the only one here. Grabbed some quick groceries, fed the youngest and changed some diapers, then back on the road.

Camp:

We stayed in Morro Bay for a few nights. Campground had 50 amp service while the trailer only needs 30amp, so a “free” charge!

Here are some photos, and one of the days we headed to Pismo to get our toes/tires in the sand.

Travel day 2: from Morro Bay to Lotus California.

We took an intentional detour for this leg of the journey. We decided to stop through Jackson, CA so we can get a photo for my son Jackson. YMVY if you opt to stay on the interstate.

1. [https://www.plugshare.com/location/350134](https://www.plugshare.com/location/350134) Tesla Supercharger - Kettleman City (the lower 55 chargers). If we weren’t at the whim of the kids needs, we would only have needed a 6 minute charge here, but once we were done taking care of the kids we charged more than originally planned which shifted our next couple charging plans. And yes, we were the only souls here.

2. [https://www.plugshare.com/location/583254](https://www.plugshare.com/location/583254) RAN - This was the best trailer stop, two perfectly located trailer stalls that can accommodate long trailers. Family was hungry for lunch so we ate at a restaurant nearby. Was excited to see that there was windshield cleaning stations, but the summer temps had other plans.

3. [https://www.plugshare.com/location/484967](https://www.plugshare.com/location/484967) RAN - this stop could have been avoided, our youngest was starting to break down a bit and we were looking to be somewhat tight on range (although I could have just chilled out on speed and more than made up for it) but we opted to stop real quick and check on the kids.

4. [https://www.plugshare.com/location/281476](https://www.plugshare.com/location/281476) Tesla Supercharger - this stop was far longer than needed. We decided to treat my son to some ice cream to make visiting Jackson CA fun for him so we stopped at Mels Diner which is in this parking lot. It’s a magic dock location. Thought the starlink connectivity was cool. We pulled up and a model Y that wasn’t towing was in this spot, but they came out of the restaurant and left after about 2 minutes of waiting. Got lucky once again.

Camp: We stayed at a place with only 30 amp service. The campground was close to vacant so I plugged into the neighboring 30 Amp service with my adapter so I can get 24 amps on the 120.  [https://amzn.to/47CyeRz](https://amzn.to/47CyeRz)

Travel day 3: Lotus to South Lake Tahoe.

No charging needed, and DAMN, these trucks are beasts. Couldn’t help myself ripping this thing up the mountain with trailer in tow.

https://reddit.com/link/1fmee0o/video/dz2i48wwk8qd1/player

Camp: Similar to the previous spot, the campground was 50% full so at night we used a bit of the 30 amp next door as we explored Tahoe during the days.

We saw 4 bears in our campground during our 3 night stay, with evidence of more during the night (see the end of the post). But when we were all sitting around at camp one afternoon my son says 'Look, a bear!' and about 15 feet from us this huge guy was sniffing in our friends stroller that was in between his truck and trailer. The bear then wondered to a neighboring camp and tore into their cooler and trash.

Travel day 4: South Lake Tahoe to Lone Pine.

1. [https://www.plugshare.com/location/191333](https://www.plugshare.com/location/191333) EA - Wife and kids needed a stop, so we pulled in here and opted for some unnecessary juice as we could have made it to Lee Vining no problem, but figured if we are stopping now we should juice up so the truck won’t need as long at the next stop. We were the only vehicle there. 

https://preview.redd.it/vpfnjys1l8qd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9fb534cb2a6d26b33dc17075cf0a526572168bf5

2. [https://www.plugshare.com/location/495842](https://www.plugshare.com/location/495842) RAN - Yet again only vehicle there. Trailer parking is great. I could have pulled up a foot or more here, but as you can see if someone is towing a larger trailer they can end up easily blocking another stall. We grabbed a pizza and ate outside. Truck was more than finished before we were done eating. 

https://preview.redd.it/aopfe137l8qd1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7029170753156ab690dcd399d1ebd0e164e911ff

Camp: We stayed at a campground with 20/30/50 amp service, so we topped up over night. We pulled in, setup the trailer then I took the family into Alabama Hills to explore during sunset, then off to dinner.

Travel day 5: Lone Pine to Perris, drop off trailer, then home!

1. [https://www.plugshare.com/location/334765](https://www.plugshare.com/location/334765) RAN - Trailer spot, we were the only Rivian here, and one Tesla came and went between both of the supercharger sites here. Bathroom break, bottle break and diaper change then back on the road.

2. [https://www.plugshare.com/location/488401](https://www.plugshare.com/location/488401) Tesla Supercharger - The final stop. I expected this one to be a bit tricky (and for the whole trip I kept eyeing [this](https://www.plugshare.com/location/643091) new v4 site nearby to go live and try and use it before people knew it was there. When I first pulled up here the first charger acted up. When I plugged in the Tesla app said showed a dialog like ‘generating charge summary’. I then pulled the truck forward a bit to try the next one. When I checked the app to initiate the next charger, the last bank of chargers (4a-d) were now marked offline on the app. Seems like the charger, not dispenser, had to reboot or something. Luckily I could pull forward even more, getting a bit close to a model S who was charging on that row, I was able to charge on the C block of chargers, and by the time we got back to the truck the D block was back online and people were using them. We grabbed some food at the stores nearby and the truck again was ready well before we were. Sorry, missed any photos for this spot but this is how I charged.

Tips and items that really helped the journey.

Since we rented the trailer, we had to pack our groceries and gear in the car. Knowing it was a heat wave and we couldn’t expect the fridge in the trailer to be cold until late that night, my 12v fridge setup came very much in handy for this journey.

I use an ecoflow to keep the fridge running so it doesn’t sap more juice from the truck. This is for long camping trips primarily, but it worked a treat here. I also recently added solar and more storage that I can put on my bed crossbars. Here is a video explaining that: \[MEDIA=youtube\]UOUI0ySBsNc\[/MEDIA\]

* I also brought my Tesla EVSE and its 20 amp adapter, definitely recommend getting one of these for whichever EVSE you use. [https://amzn.to/47ysDM0](https://amzn.to/47ysDM0)
* This sand free mat has been great. We use it at the beach, at campsites and of course during this trip. Worthwhile purchase IMO. [https://amzn.to/4eovslm](https://amzn.to/4eovslm)

Worse thing that happened?

* A bear got into my buddies Raptor. He accidentally left the window down overnight and it crawled through his window. It put a small dent in the door and two smaller tears on the interior. He lucked out, and then when he was driving down the mountain the negative pressure from the air on his door actually popped out the dent!
* My tonneau finally gave up the ghost. 2 years, tons of desert trips and hard use on the truck and the cover. I believe a few pine needles and other tree parts are believed to be the culprit.

Final numbers

Total cost of charging: $370

This could have been lower if I opted to find more campgrounds with 50amp service. I also returned home with about 100 miles of range remaining.

Gen 2 R1S - I’ve never been so impressed with a company’s customer service.
So I joined the family and took delivery of my Gen 2 R1S a week and a half ago. This car was honestly meant as a stopgap so I could get out of my Tesla lease now but I won’t have my preordered R2 for AT LEAST another 2 years. So I wasn’t looking for all the bells and whistles (as I’ll be turning this car in in 2026 anyhow) and so I opted to go with the standard audio from a factory build. Well in the week leading up to my delivery, I start seeing all the raves about the new premium audio update and Dolby Atmos and suddenly started to REALLY REGRET my choice. I had already filled out/signed all my lease papers and disclosures on the Friday and was scheduled to pick up the car on Monday. 

The next morning (Saturday) I decided to text my specialist to tell him I was really regretting not going with the premium audio as I had had seriously underestimated how much I would actually feel like I was missing out. Within 10 minutes (on a SATURDAY MORNING) he called and put me in touch with another rep who was able to find and match me with a new VIN (remember… I already had a car/VIN assigned to me) and I only had to wait 1 additional week for delivery. Same specs/color, same everything except it had premium audio instead of standard. 

A week goes by and they tell me there was a problem with my upcoming pickup as my car had been inadvertently left at the train yard but marked delivered and they had to arrange with the train yard how to actually get it. But fully acknowledging it was their mistake, they offered (at no charge) to home deliver the new R1S (which was, on a good day, about 2 hours from the pickup center). 

To say that I am extremely impressed with Rivian customer service would be an understatement. I’ve never had a company go to such lengths to make me so happy. "

1st impressions of Gen2 R1S PDM
Ok, here’s my compulsory 250 mile check-in on the new R1S. For context, I’m coming from a Mercedes GLS and we own a Tesla MYP. So comparisons will relate mostly to those - although I also have a long history with BMWs.

The R1S is a Max battery, Performance, 22 sport bright, Ocean Coast, El Cap, standard audio. Running the latest s/w ver 2024.31.30. I’m in the bay area (SJ service center is a 30 min drive)

It’s worth noting that I very nearly backed out of the purchase after watching the chaos of this subreddit and what sounded like endless issues. I was expecting to show up to a complete sh#$% show of a vehicle.

But here we are and here I go. Sorry, it’s long and rambling

**Power**: This being the performance model, I notice a significant difference between all-purpose and sport mode. It does bother me a little that I don’t get all that beans in all-purpose mode, but I love that I can access this much grunt. While the horsepower boost in Sport is a meaningful improvement (from 533 to 655) the torque increase is massive and that’s what you really feel (from 610 to 829). Honestly, this is why EVs are so compelling for me. It’s why I love the Tesla MYP. And it’s why I’d never consider something like a Kia EV9 (well that and the range) - I’d probably just recommend pure ICE like a Mazda CX-90 if someone was actually considering the Kia. Not a hybrid...don't get me started

In all-purpose there’s still decent power but it requires a lot of pedal travel to get to that power. You really need to push your foot down for the reward. This is in contrast to Teslas where power is right there even when you tap on the pedal. In sport mode however, the R1S is a different beast and is nearly as responsive and seat-of-your-pants powerful as our MYP - which is fine for me. My preference is to leave it in Sport mode all the time, but I need more data from the community (or Rivian) on how much that accelerates tire wear. If it’s the difference between 30k mile and 25k mile replacement, then I’m all in. It’s way more fun in Sport IMO. 

**Ride & handling** - so so so much better than I had expected after reading posts here. It’s not the ride-on-a-cloud suspension that I had with the Mercedes (thank god). On our model Y performance, I’m comparing it to an upgraded suspension with Ohlin coilover grand touring suspension and the R1S is far better than that setup. You get most of the precision of the Tesla, without any of the harshness. The steering is direct and somehow, for a 6500 lb vehicle, really connected to the road, responsive, and fun to drive. I will say that the “soft” setting is pretty much worthless - vaguely reminds me of a car riding on blown out shocks. Bounce, bounce, bounce.

**Interior** - In my opinion it’s like a cross between a Volvo and a Model S/X interior, which is to say it’s very good. It doesn’t feel as substantial or as opulent as the Mercedes. But I prefer the vibe and I like that it doesn’t scream affluence or have a mess of knobs and buttons, most of which I would never touch. 

Some people here say “it doesn’t feel like a $100k car” but I think that’s highly subjective. If you expect to be buried in leather and walnut with jewelry-like analog time pieces and handles, then no, it doesn’t and it absolutely won’t make you happy. If you find value in minimalism and tech, then it absolutely feels like a $100k+ car. Others have said it... that makes the Model Y feel really cheap. Don’t get me wrong. I love the Y!

It’s bigger inside than I expected TBH. The third row is a bit smaller than the Mercedes but overall it just feels more roomy inside. Maybe it’s the width? Captain’s seats would have been awesome if available, but it’s fine.

One happy surprise as a tall (6’7”) driver is that I don’t have to put the seat all the way back! Tall drivers will know how uncommon this is. I’ve never actually owned a car where I don’t have to put the seat all the way back. Like ever. And what it means is that a) I’m never cramped and b) there’s more room for people in the 2nd row! ...btw, I can see why people of smaller stature want the running boards or kneel mode

**Driver+** (..err, I mean Rivian Autonomy Platform) - I don’t have enough experience on it yet, but I will say that every time I’ve enabled it, it works (maybe 20 miles used) and for me it’s just as good as Tesla in those circumstances. No ping ponging in the lane, doesn’t swerve when there’s a new lane added trying to find the middle, no phantom braking, etc. And this may be blasphemy but I feel like it does a better job than Tesla of padding between the car ahead. I’m sure I’ll get annoyed when I want to use it on a road where it’s not available. And I’m not pretending that it’s actually as good as Tesla in its entirety, but so far it has worked really well, everywhere I’ve wanted it to. The fact that it’s (allegedly) bypassing the Nvidia platform now in favor of the janky MobileEye platform (although a slightly better 360° version of mobileye compared to Gen 1), is pretty incredible. I’m excited to see what’s possible once the Nvidia stuff comes online!

**Now, a long list of other stuff that’s popped up on these threads and just needs addressed** - Typically I wouldn’t even bring the following items up, but I will because they relate to negative experiences I’ve read about here and some of these are what almost drove me to abandon my deposit and move forward with my EX90 deposit. I don’t want to discredit any actual issues that people are having. This is simply my experience. 

* **Wind and cabin noise** - Very slightly more wind and road noise than my Mercedes. Mercedes is just exceptional at noise isolation. There’s less wind noise than the Tesla however. It’s very good in my opinion. I don’t have crossbars and I’ve heard that this is an issue for some folks
* **Fit, finish, rattles** - honestly everything is great. No rattles and I’ve checked everything else top and bottom. No paint issues. No panel spacing issues. No scratches on interior/exterior. I even laid down on a skateboard and slid underneath. I really tried to find something but couldn’t
* **Charging** - I’ve charged at home (running daisy chained Tesla universal chargers) and once at a Tesla Supercharger with the A2Z. Absolutely no issues.
* **Audio (Basic audio)** - Most people will find it perfectly ok but I’ve had enough good audio systems that it bugs me. However, here’s why I wouldn’t have purchased the Premium audio regardless. If Rivian charges $1,750 for the upgrade, my hunch is that it’s really a \~$350 upgrade at most. In fact early sleuths seem to be finding that the basic audio is effectively the same components as Premium (sans the dedicated sub and a couple speakers). If I spend $2k on installing high quality aftermarket components I think I’ll get a way better package than the Premium audio. I just need to wait 6mo for other people to be the guinea pigs and recommend the best setup. I appreciate you!!
* **Phone charging** - With an iphone 12 pro it has worked every. single. time. I was all ready to buy the s00nish retrofit but I don’t see the need. It just works.
* **Suspension noise or oddities** - none at all
* **Lag under acceleration from enable/disable of the 2nd motor** - undetectable. It’s completely seamless even under hard acceleration. It seems like Gen2 has fixed this to a point where the typical person can’t tell
* I**nsurance premium** - for some odd reason my insurance went down from trading in my Mercedes. No idea why. For reference I have Tesla insurance
* **Apple carplay** - I made the switch to Tesla pretty early on and therefore never got sucked into the carplay way of life. So it’s a non-issue for me. I’m used to the manufacturer owning the experience and I have a feeling that’s the way things are going. Note that I probably will switch from Spotify to Apple audio as I've been meaning to do that anyways. And it's great that Rivian has native integration there now.
* **Nav** - no issues so far. Same routes as Google. Although it sounds like the most recent update was a big improvement on navigation. So hopefully that’s never a problem
* **Standard glass roof, in terms of light and/or heat transfer** - the glass roof is excellent. Very similar to the model Y. Reading these forums I was sure that I’d be booking an appointment to tint the hell out of everything. I won’t be doing that.
* **AC power and noise** - Today it was 100° in the east bay and the AC was ice cold. The fan was on low and had no problem cooling the entire cabin. Yes, it does run for a while after the car is parked (longer than most cars I’ve owned), but it’s not any louder than most cars. I did see one poster showing condensation and this is real. The AC does seem to produce more condensation than other cars I've owned. But this is condensation, which is completely normal.
* **Phone key recognition** - not as good as Tesla but pretty damn close. I know this was improved with the latest update so maybe I’m benefiting from that
* **Must purchase items** - For me, the bare minimum was A2Z typhoon pro, Teslatap mini 60 amp, and Rivian all-weather mats. The basic mats are really underwhelming. I bought a bunch of other stuff but I’m finding that they’re all just nice to haves.
* **Range** - too soon to comment but so far the estimate seems to come really close to actual

One little oddity that I’ll mention in closing. When I was in the lounge waiting to get my car, a person came in complaining about the sound of the motors on the Gen1 Dual Motor. The Rivian service manager told them that this was a first attempt at a new motor and that kinks like this are to be expected on something so new and untested. Not super comforting language. I could have positioned this way better. And then, to my horror, he actually encouraged the person to go to the forums to talk about it and confirm that everyone is experiencing this loud motor noise. He literally told the person with the issue to come here and talk about it…. And I doubt that this service manager is telling people with a good experiences to come to the forms and talk about it. So not only are people who have a bad experience more likely to vent here, but the service people are literally encouraging them to come talk about their dissatisfaction. Yikes.

If you’re still reading, I think you can tell by now that I’d recommend the Rivian to pretty much anyone in this price range, without hesitation

 Facing Multiple Issues with Minor(?) Rivian R1T Warranty Repair – Seeking Advice
[Bingo about to go in for service](https://preview.redd.it/pjfva9nvyjid1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1c656e11288c4258d3a92dcd0cdb718d4315d413)

**Hi everyone,**

I’m reaching out to the community for advice on a challenging situation I’ve been facing with my Rivian R1T, which I’ve nicknamed Bingo. You may (or more likely may not!) remember my previous post [here](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/s/iNnzRcUAOL), where I showed off our R1T and R1S (Bluey). In that post, I mentioned that some minor (or so I thought) paint issues were about to be addressed on our truck—very similar to the issues detailed in [this post](https://www.rivianforums.com/forum/threads/paint-issue-on-rear-roof-painted-rubber-seal.14789/) over on Rivianforums. Unfortunately, since then, things have gone a bit awry, and I’m hoping to get some guidance on how to proceed.

# Timeline

**June 23, 2024:** Dropped Bingo off for a paint repair at the rear of the truck. We were previously informed by the service center and both of St. Louis's certified body shops—where the service center had asked me to take the truck for quotes for them—that the whole panel would be painted.

**July 12, 2024:** I called on July 12th, when I was expecting to pick up the truck, and was told by the collision center: ""*I'm happy to be able to tell you that we will fix your truck, but it fell off the lift during final inspection and will need some minor repairs.*"" Though the quotation is unlikely to be verbatim, the tone is unchanged, and the delivery was odd.

* **Updates:** I received seven phone calls from the body shop with various updates over the next couple of days, including:
   * A minor scratch occurred to the paint during reassembly.
   * Parts from Rivian were still pending.
   * The truck would be repainted over the weekend and ""baked for 48 hours so the paint was so hard nothing would scratch it.""
   * Ultimately, we never found out what happened at the collision center—the experience was a bit unsettling.
* **Request:**
   * I asked Rivian to inspect Bingo completely before it was returned to their service center, stating I was not prepared to pick the truck up directly from the body shop.
   * I also requested a loaner vehicle to cover the time we would be without a car for commuting. Interestingly, though I spoke to Rivian, the collision center reached out and provided an Enterprise rental vehicle for the week it took them to rework the truck.

**July 19, 2024:** Picked Bingo up from the service center.

* **Immediate Observations:** Upon walking up to the truck, I immediately noticed:
   * The plastic trim on top of the tailgate was ripped on the passenger side, appearing as if it had been caught on something and pulled up.
   * The plastic trim behind the rear window on the passenger side was not installed correctly and was loose.
   * The paint behind the rear window looked better than when sent in but had been touched up with a paint pen.
   * Instead of painting the whole panel, a spot repair was done and blended.
* **Service Center Actions:**
   * They asked if they could fix the trim issues and requested I pick the truck up later that day. I agreed but was unable to return until after the service center had just closed, so I picked Bingo up that evening.
   * They explained that the paint repair method was determined by the body shop and that Rivian did not recommend how it should be done, as it was ""*up to the discretion of the body shop to do the job they thought was most appropriate and economical.*""
* **Additional Concerns:**
   * Though the Gear Guard had been left on during the repair, all footage from the camera over the bed showed as deleted. The service center was confused by this but suggested that it might be the result of the spoiler being removed from the truck, which was concerning since the truck was being stored outside.
   * During the drive home, after stopping for food, I noticed the plastic trim on the top of the truck bed on the passenger side was flapping. The clips had broken off at the back, making it loose.
   * Upon arriving home, I inspected Bingo and found:
      * The spoiler was not installed correctly, sticking up above the moonroof window.
      * The plastic trim behind the window (above the cavity for the tonneau cover) was deeply scratched.
      * The trim surrounding the gear tunnel was not installed correctly, with tabs visible when the gear tunnel was open.

**July 22, 2024:** Dropped Bingo off at the service center.

* **Response:** The service center was excellent, acknowledged all issues, apologized for not checking the truck properly before returning it, and promised to fix everything.
* **Loaner Vehicle:** Received a loaner R1T and was informed they would contact me when Bingo was ready for pickup.

**July 29, 2024:** Picked Bingo up from the service center.

* **Repairs Completed:** The service center replaced the following to remediate the job done by the collision center:
   * Two of the three pieces of the plastic trim behind the rear window.
   * The trim on the passenger side truck bed.
   * The trim surrounding the passenger side gear tunnel.
   * The trim around the rear passenger side wheel.
   * The spoiler.
   * The trim on top of the tailgate.
   * Both left and right internal B pillar panels.
   * Passenger side A pillar trim.
* **Minor Issue:** I did not notice a scratch on the rear passenger window trim until the next day. I decided to leave it as I felt we’d been through enough and was just happy to have Bingo back.
* **Aside:** The collision center also did some PDR (Paintless Dent Repair) work on the hood from some hail, which turned out great. However, they snapped some of the clips holding the black plastic trim under the hood, causing it to hang down an inch at the front when opened. While fixing the other issues, the Rivian service center mentioned they managed to replace some of the clips and would replace the plastic as a goodwill gesture if it came loose again.

**August 2, 2024:** Paint failed.

* **Observation:** While preparing to wash Bingo, I noticed that the paint had failed on the rear panel. It appeared that seam sealer had been applied over the old paint, which was not adhering properly, causing it to wrinkle and crack. I opened a ticket with Rivian on August 4th
* **Photos of the work performed (Before/After) can be seen here:** [Imgur Album](https://imgur.com/a/kw2PhSn)

# Current Situation

I’ve spoken to Rivian, and they suggested taking Bingo back to the service center, who in turn would take the truck to the same collision repair center that did the original work. Although there are two Rivian-certified collision centers in St. Louis, the service center only wanted to use one of them (the same one that did the original work, causing additional damage and ultimately a failed repair) and seemed very hesitant about the other, while very confident that the poor experience to date with the ‘3rd party’ was a one-off and not typical of the work they usually see coming out of there. When I asked again if the other local collision center could potentially do the work, the service center was doubtful that the alternative would be able to do as clean a job or even take on reworking a previous repair, in addition to having a much longer lead time due to the volume of work they were taking on.

# Possible Next Steps

Given everything that has happened, I’m considering escalating this issue directly to Rivian’s corporate team or requesting the repair be done via the Normal, IL service center (which is the second closest one to me). I’m open to advice on how best to approach these options or if there are other steps I should consider.

# Request for Community Input

If anyone has gone through similar repair issues with Rivian, especially regarding multiple repairs or dealing with different collision centers, I’d love to hear how your situation was resolved. Any insights on whether I should push for the repair in Normal, IL, or give the original collision center another chance would be greatly appreciated.

# Disclaimer

I want to emphasize that my intent here is to seek constructive advice and resolution, not to bash Rivian. I’m hoping to get this situation resolved fairly and efficiently. I really love our truck—it’s the car I learned to drive in, and we got an R1S for my wife based on how much we both like it. I can't emphasize enough how much I want to put this behind us and get back to just enjoying the Rivian experience. It’s a small thing in the scheme of things, but something that should be fixed to a satisfactory standard—we bought the truck new from Rivian and noticed this issue while picking the truck up from Normal, where at the factory they told us this would be an easy fix for us to do down the line.

# Follow-Up

I’ll update this post with any progress or resolution as it happens, in case it’s helpful for others who might face similar issues.

**August 14, 2024:**

* **Contact:** A Senior Regional Field Services Manager, reached out to me - they had read this post and seemed very receptive: they committed to working with the service center in STL and the local regional SC manager to come up with a plan fwd, which I'll hopefully get today (15th August 2024).
* **Steering Wheel Twitching:** Since picking up the truck and driving \~80 miles on it, the steering wheel has twitched a few times to the right, especially when slowing down or driving at \~25 mph. At first, I thought it was lane-keeping kicking in, but now I’m not so sure. It might be partially out of fear of whatever happened at the body-shop, but I feel the truck is drifting slightly to the right as well. I'll be asking them to check this when the truck goes in.

**August 15th, 2024:**

* **Update:** The Senior Regional Field Services Manager reached out to say it would take them a little longer to come up with a solution.

**August 16th, 2024:**

* **Update:** Communicated with the Senior Regional Field Services Manager, who proposed using the other Rivian-certified collision center in St. Louis for the remedial work. The team at this center requested a pre-evaluation of the necessary repairs to properly plan and execute the work. Rivian proposed having the R1T picked up on Tuesday, August 20th, for an evaluation, which would take about an hour to an hour and a half. They also offered the use of a Zipcar during that time, which was thoughtful but unnecessary since the truck would be picked up and dropped off at my office. Rivian also committed to providing a loaner R1T while the repairs are completed.

**August 19th, 2024:**

* **Update:** Rivian called to confirm they would pick the truck up with the local service center manger and their manager.

**August 20th, 2024:**

* **Update:** The local service center manager emailed to request canceling picking up the R1T as the collision center would be unable to assess the truck during the day, and suggested moving the evaluation to the 21st.

**August 21st, 2024:**

* **Update:** Rivian picked up truck from my office and took it to the other certified collision center in St Louis, before dropping it back off at the office a couple hours later. They did warn that the body shop was booked out for over a month so may take some time to get in.

**August 22nd, 2024:**

* **Update:** Got email from local service center manger stating that they would be getting an estimate back from the bodyshop on the 23rd and would then make a plan of action.

**August 27th, 2024:**

* **Update:** Reached out to the local service center manager after not hearing anything—got an update within two hours that the truck had been booked in for service on the **9th of September** and would be away for a minimum of three weeks, with some additional time after it was done to enable Rivian to check the vehicle (meaning that this issue will have resulted in the truck being in service for likely 50+ days for an issue reported on day 1).
* **Response**:
   * **Need to Confirm Date:** I need to check that the 9th would work, as I’ve got some travel and family commitments at the start of September.
   * **Request for Detailed Work Plan:** I would like a description of what work will be performed. I don’t want us to repeat the confusion that occurred the first time—when both the service center and collision center stated that the whole panel would be painted prior to dropping the truck off and then reneging on that verbal commitment later with a touch-up and work with a paint pen (which presumably is why we are in this mess now).

**August 28th, 2024:**

* **Update:** I was sent a copy of the work order detailing what the collision center will be performing. The estimate totaled over 100 hours in labor alone. Interestingly, they have elected to completely repaint both of the unified side panels, which involves the removal and replacement of most of the exterior components and rear seats of the truck—so it will be fresh paint (excluding doors) right from the tailgate through the sills up to the A-pillars. While this seems like a thorough approach, I can’t help but feel some caution about the level and invasiveness of the work being done, given the extensive disassembly involved. Hopefully, this will lead to a more permanent fix without introducing any new issues. Following the \~30 days it will be at the collision center, Rivian will then perform a structural and alignment check at their service center.

**September 9th, 2024:**

* **Update:** The truck was picked up by the service center, and they dropped off an R1S as a loaner vehicle. While it’s a shame I won’t be able to easily load bikes in the R1S, I’m hopeful that in about a month, we’ll have Bingo back on the road. I also requested that they add a spare wheel to the work order (at our expense) —after going through all this, it will be nice to get back to enjoying the vehicle with some peace of mind during longer trips.

**September 13th, 2024:**

* **Update:** Rivian reached out to confirm that everything was progressing as planned and they expected to return the truck within the next three weeks.

**September 23rd, 2024:**

* **Update:** Rivian provided an update, noting that the body shop was finishing up a few remaining tasks on the truck and they were aiming to have it ready by the end of the following week. They mentioned they would check in with me mid-week to arrange for inspection and pickup.

**September 25th, 2024:**

* **Update:** Rivian asked about my availability for the afternoon of October 1st, mentioning that the body shop aimed to complete work on the truck by the end of the week. Once the truck was back at the service center, Rivian would finish a few final tasks, and we would do a walkaround inspection to ensure the repairs were satisfactory.

**September 26th, 2024:**

* **Update:** Rivian informed me via a phone call (@1:07PM) that the truck had not passed the body shop’s internal inspection, so they planned to repaint some sections—meaning certain areas will now potentially get repainted three times. The body shop was aiming to finish by the following Tuesday and would update me once they had more information from the body shop.

**October 1st, 2024:**

* **Update:** Rivian informed me via email that the truck would be ready for pick up by them that day. They planned to take it back to the service center on Wednesday, October 2nd, with the goal of having it ready for me to pick up on Thursday, October 3rd.

**October 2nd, 2024:**

* **Update:** Rivian informed me via phone call that the truck had not passed their internal inspection due to issues with the paintwork. They indicated that it would be sent back to the body shop to have the clear coat touched up, and they would provide an updated timeline once the rework was scheduled.

**October 3rd, 2024:**

* **Update:** Rivian informed me via text that the truck was being taken back to the body shop so they could ""touch up the clear coat in a few areas."" They committed to providing a further update on Friday, October 4th.

**October 4th, 2024:**

* **Update:** Rivian reached out in the morning to inform me that the truck was ready for pickup. We arranged to pick up Bingo that afternoon. However, upon inspecting the truck with the service team, it became apparent that much of the work Rivian had been invoiced for—and presumably paid for—by the collision center had not been completed. For example, although the estimate indicated that both side panels had been fully repainted, it was clear that the panels had only been partially repainted. This was easy to identify because the T-Wraps PPF on the door sills was still intact, among other discrepancies. Additionally, there was an issue with the headliner not sitting flush against the glass roof on the driver's side and it was cracked on the B-pillar near the rear passenger side door. Given these concerns, Rivian opted to keep the truck to replace the headliner and determine the extent of the work that had actually been performed by the collision center.

Gen 2 R1S after 1 week…
Picked up last Friday @ Miami SC. The process was nice and easy. I work with customers and to me customer service is highly important. I like this whole no dealership experience from Rivian. No sharks. No up selling. The guy at my pick up appointment was great. Patient. Answered every question I had. Showed me some stuff. Very informative. This is my first EV experience. I’m coming from a 2023 Volvo XC90 2 year lease. The R1S gives me more space and storage. 

So 257 miles in let’s get something out of the way quick. Premium Audio does not suck. No a Camry or Corolla do not sound better than this (comparison’s I’ve read on here that made me laugh) Anyhow I’m coming from a bowers & wilkins sound system in the Volvo. That was and is a great system. The premium audio on the Rivian is good. I’ve tweaked it throughout the week. Sounds good to me. Looking forward to Apple Music bringing Dolby. 

AC. It works great. Far beyond my expectations. I won’t need a shade and what not. Not an issue to me. Takes less than 5 minutes to cool down when I turn on AC before heading out. Multiple days with cabin temp past 120. One day said 138. No issues with AC. I did apply ceramic tints on both front windows and clear ceramic on the windshield the next day of owning it. AC noise? Just like every other car I’ve owned since I was 17. I’m 42 now. People expect a quiet AC because EV’s don’t make noise? That’s a thing I guess. When I turn on AC as soon as cabin starts to cool the noise lowers. Again all of this seems normal to me. 

When I did demo in May on a ‘24 Quad. I enjoyed that. That drive is what made me want a Rivian. With that said the Gen 2 suspension feels much better. Less cabin noise. The driving dynamic just feels better to me. Maybe it’s a thing maybe it’s just because it’s new. Time will tell. 

Kneel mode is awesome. I thought I would need to add running boards. I won’t have to. My wife appreciates kneel mode. I don’t see it consuming lots of energy. Suspension doesn’t make noises nor do I worry about wear & tear. It’s a 3 year lease. Stays on forever. 

What vampire drain? None what so ever. I’m not losing any charge over night. 

I will be charging @ work. Did charge on Tuesday with my mobile charger connected to a 220 plug my electrician installed 2 weeks ago. 60 amp breaker. My parking spot in front one of the breaker rooms. Was charging at 32 amps. Getting 20 miles per hour. 

Fast charging? Tried it twice. FPL evolution and Tesla supercharger at a Wawa 2 blocks away from house. Used new typhoon adapter by A2Z. So easy to use that. 

I have a DM standard. I only drive 150 miles a week. Been fine. Averaging about 2.2. I have not taken a trip on it yet. That’s coming soon. 

Everything works fine to me. Spotify has been working fine since day 1 but I’m an Apple Music guy. I don’t miss Apple CarPlay. 

So far I’m enjoying this Rivian. So far great experience. Suspension set to soft. Standard height. Soft regen. That’s my set up. Drives like a beauty. 

I’ve met a great new friend on this subreddit. He actually picked up his R1T last Saturday from same location. Local guy too. We gonna meet up soon. I also join the Rivian Club of South Florida. Many great local guys too. Learning more and more. 

Enjoy your Rivians. Don’t not pick so much. Not everybody has a bad experience. There’s many of us with great experiences who are too busy enjoying our new toys. 

Knock on wood for many miles of good experiences and satisfaction. "

How long to initiate charge?
Tesla Wall connector Gen 3 set to “Any Electeic Vehicle” and no scheduled time.  Rivian R1S Gen 2. I purchased a Tesla NACS to J1772 from Amazon. Went camping and used the Tesla Mobile charger with the adapter and charged instantly. 

Called Tesla support and they said there was a problem and sent me a new charger. I replaced it and get the same result. 

The wall connector won’t initiate the charge for several hours. If I plug in at 9pm, I’ll see the charging start around 12am/midnight. 

The Rivian says “Waiting on Charger”


Edit.
100% confirmed. Don’t buy a cheap NACS to J1772 adapter for the Rivian. The one I bought was $65 on Amazon.  This prevented the charger from instantly charging upon plugging in. Bought the Lutron one and instant charge upon plugging it in. "

No Remote Start - Seriously!
I’ve been a Tesla user for many years and phone keys works. Worst case, you call a family member to open the car remotely and start remotely.

Yesterday my wife’s phone died and the phone won’t start. 

With Tesla like expectations, I confidently tried to unlock the car and start, first the car will not even connect.

Ended up calling Rivian support, even they could not unlock remotely.

The worst thing, Rivian support confirmed that there is nothing like Remote Start! 

Support suggested that one you unlock remotely, charge your phone and everything will work! This does not help if the phone is dead!! 

Luckily, the car was not far, I drove there with the keys to unlock and start the R1S.

Guys, always carry the key card."

Just realized I can get a daily charge (5% to 70%) from PG&E during off peak hours.  (EVA rate plan).  PG&E just raised rates for peak to nearly $0.70.  Yes I have solar, but better off selling unused solar to PG&E during peak hours. In the SF Bay Area. No RAN or DCFC anywhere close. 
EDIT - My mistake, I can start charing at 11pm and end at 7am.  Extra hour will get me closer to 70%, but not all the way.   Now can I do weekends? 

Just an observation of how horrible PG&E is with their pricing.  And just wait for the PSPS shutdowns PG&E has been promising when the winds kick in. 

Yes I know on the EVA rate plan I have 8 hours of off-peak hours weeknights.  But the Rivian software won’t allow me to program in that extra hour.  (My Volt does, but not Rivian).  And yes I can manually override and charge dung partial-peak and peak hours.  

I suspect PG&E customers on the EV rate plan will be paying $1.00 kWhr in the near future.   "

Rivian Wall Charger Solid Red Light Issue
Hi All,

I’ve been charging my Rivian R1S and Mini Cooper SE on a Rivian wall charger for about a year now.  Every once in a while something happens and the charging session won’t start as scheduled.  I’ll check the Rivian app and see the wall charger status is Offline.  So I unplug it, wait a few minutes, plug it in, wait a few minutes and then it comes back online.  I plug it back in and usually don’t have any issues for several months.  Starting last night  I got the solid red light.  Did the normal unplug/replug as noted above.  This time though after just a few minutes of charging at 11.2 kWh I get the solid red light again.  I did a soft reboot of the Rivian just to make sure it wasn’t the vehicle but it again went red. So now, I plugged in my JuiceBox and so far no issues.  Has this happened to anyone else? Will a hot garage impact the charger? I’m in Sacramento and we are having a heat wave so even though the vehicle started charging at midnight the garage was probably 95 degrees.  During the hottest part of the day, when not charging the garage was probably around 110.  I’ll likely reach out to Rivian but wanted to check with the think tank.  "

Charge won’t start sometimes
Has anyone else had this issue? Periodically when I plug in a level 2 charger my R1 won’t start charging. I can hear the charge lock cycling trying to lock the cable to the car. In the app, I see the graphic cycle between plugged in and unplugged. I have to reseat the charger several time before it finally locks in place and starts the charge. All of fine after that. This happens on several L2 chargers.

Here is a link to video of the car cycling the charge port lock and the app status, it was too large to upload to the site.

Bellevue Service Center Woes
Sorry, just needed to vent a little bit here.

I have been waiting for a service center appointment since October of last year, originally for a grinding noise I hear on high ride height when flooring it. During the wait, they came back and added replacement tonneau cover to it and I tossed in a few other annoyances I noticed (water sloshing in the doors…again, adjustment of the hood, a bad tweeter, and a slight wind noise/leak at speed. So a pretty hefty ticket but nothing too bonkers.

Took it in as scheduled on 6/11, was told they probably wouldn’t get to it for a week but I’ll be dammed if I’m going to let them push my appointment any further so I take a rental car and go. 

After ~10 days I call asking if the car will be ready by the following weekend because I have a camping trip planned and am told that it “should be”. No calls back and so I call again a couple days later on Thursday or Friday and now they are saying “unlikely”. Ug, fine.

Fast forward a bit and I get a call saying that they have started working on it now (WTF!) and it probably won’t take more than a few days.

That was 5 days ago now I believe. Called yesterday saying I have plans for the 4th and really need it can I please get an update or at least a bigger rental/loaner so I can haul the family+gear. Said they would get back and whatcha know it’s now 8:45pm and I haven’t heard a thing.

It’s been over 3 weeks now, and I’m really getting sick of pumping gas for the first time in years!

Shame on you Rivian. I love the truck but as an early believer (sub-10k VIN) as well as a shareholder this treatment (or lack thereof) is pretty concerning. If you are going to be super late at least communicate properly."

Your Rivian is Not A Cell Phone
[*This post was originally published to my Medium, but shared here in full for free. You can support me by clicking through*](https://medium.com/@cartergee/your-rivian-isnt-a-cell-phone-9091cff0d6f9)*.*

———————————————

When I bought my Rivian, I knew that I was buying something new from a new company. My ‘Launch Edition R1T’ would have an “early adopter tax” that I would have to pay in exchange for getting to have my truck sooner. All in all, that trade off has been worth it. Yes, there are some annoying tradeoffs — my truck has had quite a bit of service, for example — but getting the thing I’d been waiting years for early felt awesome.

As the company begins to bring new models to market, the R1, which includes the pickup R1T and SUV R1S, is Rivian’s “[handshake with the world](https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-announces-mid-sized-platform).” It’s their flagship model and stunned the auto industry once people got their hands on it. The R1T was [MotorTrend’s 2022 truck of the year](https://www.motortrend.com/videos/1_wdq7c819/2022-motortrend-truck-of-the-year-rivian-r1t/), it earned the [highest satisfaction rating in 2023](https://rivian.com/newsroom/article/rivian-r1t-earns-highest-satisfaction-ranking-by-jd-power) from JD Power and Associates, and [Car and Driver gave it a 10/10 ](https://www.caranddriver.com/rivian/r1t)— with the most critical call out (annoyingly) being the omission of CarPlay (*note: I will die on the hill that CarPlay is not that great, @ me*)

My experience matched the public consensus. My truck is a quad-motor beast in an army green, limited color (fittingly named ‘Launch Green’). Its name is Rivet, it has a custom license plate, and I love it.

But, last week, my truck and every other Rivian on the road today got a distinguisher many owners weren’t expecting: Gen 1.

# Hello Gen 2

https://preview.redd.it/jt596fzb2e6d1.png?width=2048&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e0b9ab6c195c1cb64356a2646ecb0b466d90983

While it hasn’t been a secret that Rivian would be refreshing the R1 series (they’ve teasing a refresh for quite some time), I think it’s reasonable for folks to be a bit surprised by just how major the refresh actually is. Following a temporary plant shutdown to retool the production line, Rivian debuted its Gen 2 R1s.

There is also a quad motor option coming some time in 2025 for an undisclosed price to join the Ascent trim alongside the Tri Max.

The latest models improve over Gen 1, which has been on the market for almost three years now, in several areas. Here are the most noticeable changes that Gen 2 brings:

* Autonomy+ which brings upgraded sensors and cameras to unlock more autonomous driving potential exclusive to Gen 2 (Gen 1 has Driver+, which will continue to be supported and improved; much more on this below)
* Improved range and efficiency thanks to a density battery pack and…
* …all motors in-house (Enduro), which replace the Bosch motors
* Dramatically simpler design, especially with regards to electronics (1.6mi of wiring removed per vehicle, ECUs down from 17 to 7)
* Improved air suspension and the removal of low speed “chirping”
* Significantly improved vampire drain thanks to a reworking of how Gear Guard and other systems work
* Dynamic glass roof which can dim at the press of a button
* New, Storm Blue color (Ascend-only)
* Heat pump
* Improved charging pad with divider
* Fog lights replaced with turn signals, replacing the turn signal from the stadium lights
* Updated light bar, which shows charge percent
* Updated seat design, now with more plaid-y looks

A few things are the same or, in some cases, a bit worse:

* The frunk is slightly smaller to accommodate the heat pump (11.1 cu ft to 9.8 cu ft)
* Charger port still uses CCS, not NACS
* Charger port no longer has the charging ring
* Meridian audio is fully replaced by Rivian’s own solution (Meridian did not come back for the Ascent model as some may have hoped)

# But what about Gen 1?

Gen 1 is still being sold / leased for as long as those vehicles are around, even though they’re no longer being produced. Today, you can go to the R1 Shop and buy one. People who have preordered one can still have their Gen 1 trucks delivered at any moment. That really begs the question, “How should Gen 1 owners feel about this?”

I think that answer is different depending on when you received your vehicle and what kind of R1 you have. Candidly, I think owners who bought a truck in the last 6mo or so have a pretty good reason to not be especially happy right now.

Current owners of the R1 quad motor packages should be feeling the most okay. There is no quad motor option until sometime in 2025 and it’s going to be *very* pricey. One of the main draws for Rivian was that one-motor-per-wheel feature and it’s still very neat. Moreover, if you have Meridian audio, count your lucky stars. Finally, as Sandy Munro put it, the Launch Edition vehicles are extremely overbuilt and many folks got them for a discounted rate after Rivian honored the original prices post-hike. *(That’s the boat I’m in, personally)*

Most models of cars get a refresh every year and *never* receive software updated. But with all the technology in EVs, we’ve come to expect software support for the life of the vehicle. With how quickly tech is evolving, we may want the latest and greatest like we would in a cell phone, but **vehicles are not cell phones.**

Your vehicle is a durable good meant to be replaced after many, many years. Thinking about your vehicle the same way you think about your cell phone is 1) unhealthy and 2) really expensive. We all have these fancy trucks that we like to show off in the same we like to show off our fancy cell phones, but they’re just not the same. It might take some willpower to not feel less cool or left in the dust, but there’s a lot to appreciate about owning a Launch Edition as well — something no one else will get, ever.

https://preview.redd.it/kf6tdyhi2e6d1.jpg?width=2559&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72552755fa7af8fefc9ed87a3db6a1aa544c10b2

Rivian understands that all of its current customers are “stuck” with Gen 1 and is committed to bringing much of the goodness from Gen 2 into Gen 1, at least as much as they’re able. Most of those future Gen 1 improvements will be software related *(like the $14.99 Connect+ subscription that brings more entertainment options)*, though some new hardware in Gen 2 can be applied to fix some issues in Gen 1. Moreover Rivian is incentivized to not only keep Gen 1 happy (remember that handshake?), but also not fork development across multiple platforms.

All in all, I’m not convinced that the upgrades are worth an extra $20–50k depending on trim and where you’re coming from if you already own a Rivian. We also don’t know what issues the refreshed models will have. While it’s reasonable to hope for way fewer, you never know if the updated vehicles will have their edition of a dash rattle, triangle window wind noise, or suspension chirps.

It’s not that I’m telling you how to feel (your feelings are like, so valid), it’s just that… I’m sorta telling you to not feel too bad about this, especially if you’re a quad-motor owner or owned the vehicle for several years already. But there is one elephant in the room…

# About Autonomy+

This is the real kicker for folks, and something I don’t think Rivian handled especially well. Despite a refresh being public knowledge, folks probably didn’t expect that Autonomy+ would replace Driver+ — making Gen 1 significantly inferior to Gen 2 despite Rivian’s promises.

Autonomy+ brings several new features to Gen 2 thanks to upgraded sensors and cameras. With the new array, folks will be able to lane change autonomously, see their blind spot, and more. It’s not clear if any of these new features will make it to Driver+.

Over the years, Rivian has touted its self-driving capabilities, even going so far as to say that there was no reason why their vehicles couldn’t reach Level 3 autonomy and promising as much on the website. Here are some quotes from the media ([via Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1dbajpz/has_everyone_collectively_forgotten_that_level_3/)):

>

Well, that doesn’t seem like the case anymore and the website’s been changed.

Another interesting wrinkle to contribute to dissatisfaction is that Connect+ includes specific upgrades to Autonomy+ as part of the subscription fee, but Gen 1 owners will not get to experience them. Owners of both generations will pay the same $15.99/mo, making it a worse deal for Gen 1. Even though Rivian has promised to keep improving Driver+ over time, this sorta stings.

https://preview.redd.it/vz2klxtj2e6d1.png?width=2000&format=png&auto=webp&s=822bdccf4c49e465800524a71b6145a4f4b5baca

To Rivian’s credit, one thing that needs to be considered is the environment in which Rivian started production. Back in 2020 there was this little tiny global supply chain issue which greatly restricted all automakers’ access to the parts they needed. Rivian has never come out and said, “We would have preferred this part over the one we ended up buying,” but I imagine that’s the case, specifically for the cameras and sensors. *(Remember that Tesla just… fully removed radars for a time period)* Rivian was a new player and probably had to make some concessions.

Does that mean there’s no hope for Autonomy+ on Gen 1? Eh, there’s close to no hope. It’s not easy to replace all those sensor, but Rivian did indicate in 2021 that a fully-autonomous capability could be coming for an upcharge:

>

But that was a long time ago, and it’s probably easiest to just assume that Gen 1 won’t be getting those spiffy new Autonomy+ features owners felt they were promised.

—

This refresh is a great thing for the company overall. It brings down cost-per-vehicles, entices new buyers before the R2 launch, and tees up another model launch in 2025 (Quad Max). It gives the company a lot of momentum and isn’t something to be especially mad about. That said, I do think newer Gen 1 owners have a right to feel miffed, as well as folks whose main reason for buying a Rivian was driverless tech.

But if you have a Gen 1 preorder and haven’t taken your vehicle yet? I would wait. Absolutely.

That R1 handshake is still firm, but it’s reasonable if some people loosened their grip a little after Gen 2 was announced.

I Spent Two Days With Gen-2 R1 Vehicles. Here’s My Thoughts as an Owner...
Rivian invited me out to Seattle last week to check out the refreshed R1T and R1S flagships. There’s going to be a lot of great content out today, but I wanted to talk to you as someone who has owned and daily driven both an R1T and R1S for the last two years. Owner to owner—or potential owner. While these new vehicles look similar on the surface, they’re indeed very different with the vast majority of internal components altered or made entirely new. This means lower production costs and better construction—good things necessary for Rivian’s survival; however, so doing will leave some of us gen-1 owners quite mad.



**“Under The Hood”**

Let’s start with things you won’t notice but will increase reliability while lowering assembly costs. Their new “zonal architecture” cuts 17 ECUs down to just 7. Entire harnesses have been eliminated, over a mile of wiring at nearly 50 pounds of weight has been shed, and the infotainment PCB now shares a cold plate and PCIe interconnect with the AXM (autonomy experience module). This doesn’t just save on component cost, but provides huge improvements on assembly times. The infotainment SoC has remained the same with no updates. Rivian engineers tell me software optimization—rather than new silicon—has allowed new visuals and features (which we’ll discuss soon) to come to gen-1 hardware and mostly maintain one software branch. Great news.

Other under-the-hood changes include the elimination of the ethernet bus, which allows for several systems to remain entirely dormant while others (like the module that runs Gear Guard) stay live. Rivian tells me this will result in “industry-leading” phantom drain performance. Servicing the BMS previously required dropping the entire pack (as it was on top)—a 10-hour job—and has now been relocated to the underside of the vehicle, allowing for many pack repairs in under an hour. Physical fuses have also been eliminated in favor of e-fuses, saving time at service and yielding better diagnostic data of failures.

All battery packs have received minor redesigns. Large and Max packs now have 2170 cells with 53g of density rather than 50g, which helps push range to 420 miles on the dual-motor max pack with the most efficient wheels. I want to credit Rivian with doing anything here, but this is likely just Samsung SDI shifting the majority of production to their INR21700-53G. That said, they changed their die-casting process to reduce mass and simplify manufacturing—“substantially lowering” cost. Exciting and new is the shift to LFP in the standard pack, which claims up to 270 miles EPA. This, like most LFP packs, will be safe to charge to 100% all the time with little to no degradation. Rivian refused to disclose their LFP provider, but it’s pretty obvious. The state of Illinois just gave beaucoup money ($2B) to Chinese battery producer Gotion for a new LFP factory slated to open at the end of the year, very close to Normal. Gotion already has a factory in California that will allow standard-range models to qualify for the full EV tax credit, while the new factory awaits completion. A little birdie tells me the new LFP pack can hit 240kW while DC fast charging. This would be an industry near-record and excellent if true.

Other minor changes include a heat pump, which will obviously help winter range, and the compressor has been moved off of the firewall to help with NVH. Unfortunately, this comes at the expense of reasonably substantial front trunk space. Not only is there a pretty sizable square cutout from the sub-frunk, but the frunk itself is both shallower and with more gradual walls. Volumetrically, it’s a LOT smaller. There are some things redesigned—gone is the bifold subfloor and magnet in favor of a single piece that can be propped up. It feels functional if a bit cheap. There are also two “pockets” on each side of the frunk tub; however, they’re relatively small and I’m not sure what you’d put in them beyond some documentation or a compressor hose. I don’t know how I didn’t grab a photo of it; alas, I failed to do so. Apologies.



**Drivetrain & Suspension**

Goodbye, Bosch. Hello, new in-house, two-motor drive units! Not only does Rivian have replacements for the prior quad-motor design, but they are also adding a tri-motor configuration to the lineup. You’ve seen the specs already, I’m sure… 850HP and a 2.9s 0-60 for the tri-motor, while the quad-motor offers 1,025HP, nearly 1,200 lb-ft of torque, and a 0-60 time of less than 2.5s (for R1T—R1S is slower). These new motors are incredible. Oil-cooled with the inverters mounted atop (with a shared heat exchanger betwixt them), they have a smooth responsiveness I’ve never felt with my Bosch units. Owners know that pulling off of (or rapidly applying) the pedal creates a bit of a “lurch,” and throttle input delay exists (however small). That’s not present in these motors at all, and I now feel the pedal travel and mapping feel exceeds Tesla (which I’ve long considered the benchmark for throttle response). It’s wickedly good. 

The tri-motor is a really special configuration. See, these new units still have the half-shaft mechanical disconnect at the rear; however, it is dynamic and now works irrespective of drive mode. So, floor your throttle in Conserve, and it’ll re-connect the power and give you the beans you seek. Additionally, other drive modes may disconnect the rear linkage unbeknownst to you—seamlessly maximizing range and performance. Frankly, it makes me wonder if some of the drive modes are redundant now. I asked Mason Verbridge, principal drive unit engineer if this would also mean power is applied at the rear from a stop in Conserve mode to save on front tire wear. He confirmed it would. Sweet! While this trick still works on the quad-motor, you don’t have the efficiency of the single-motor Enduro front-drive unit (FDU) which yields markedly lower range. While the dual-motor configuration is still the range-king, only BARELY. Mason told me on the highway, you’d only likely see a real-world range difference of 1-2 miles (yes, you read that right) between the dual and tri-motor of the same pack size. Frickin’ awesome.

There’s a new “light” regen mode that will be coming to all Rivian models (gen-1 included) that is very subtle and probably ideal for new EV drivers and/or to accommodate passengers susceptible to car sickness.

Suspension got a massive upgrade. Air springs have been revised, and the suspension feel in general has been changed—particularly on R1S. The truck also feels “smoother,” and gone is the awful low-speed squeaky sound, but the R1S is the vehicle on which the new suspension shines. I overheard an unnamed engineer talking to an unnamed PR person who asked what the big difference was with gen-2 ride quality. They responded under their breath, “well, we made the suspension actually good.” On R1S, gone is the super firm front end and waffly, floaty rear end. Recalibrated spring rates provide significantly smoother road feel without the ""bouncy” feeling experienced on gen-1's “Soft"" suspension mode. Active dampers tighten things up really nicely in Sport mode with a more reasonable rebound rate. The best equivalence I can offer is that you can now feel the road through your hands and legs but not through your teeth. Gone is the oversteer bounce in tight corners, feeling nearly as planted as the gen-1 R1T—an awe-inspiring achievement considering the wheelbase differences. Long story short, if you had put me in the passenger seat blindfolded, I would have never guessed I was in an R1S in a million years. It feels SO MUCH BETTER I can't even begin to explain it. It's the single biggest generational upgrade that makes me consider trading in my “old"" R1S.



**Driver+ Autonomy and False Advertising**

Do you even self-drive, bro…? Gen-2 brings an entirely new platform that includes 11 high-res cameras (which look phenomenal—the best I’ve seen in any car ever—and are a massive leap from the \[pardon my Spanish\] mierda they were previously shipping). Two new NVIDIA SoCs bring 10x the compute of gen-1, and improved radars and ultrasonics help those cameras see better and further. VP of Autonomy James Philbin says Rivian really believes in multiple sensor modalities—that vision-only is not the way forward. Of course, this brought questions: “Well, is this going to fully self-drive, or will this be a level 3/4 system, etc.?” They answered: “There’s no reason this hardware would prevent that; it’s really a software problem.” But they’re also making very few promises for anything other than (1) better visualizations on the binnacle display, (2) lane changes, and (3) eventual hands-free driving under limited circumstances. It remains limited to previously mapped highways, and there are no plans to let it function on city streets.

The lane change functionality works really well. You now pull the drive stalk towards you twice to engage Driver+ (instead of down) and pushing the opposing turn stalk up or down begins a signal, ensures the lane is clear, and then makes the lane change quite aggressively and confidently. It’s good. If the lane is blocked, or there are rapidly approaching vehicles, it keeps trying to look for an opening for about 10 seconds, and if it can’t complete the maneuver, it cancels the request and stays in the current lane. Good design, in my opinion. The driver monitoring system is alleged to be present in the rear-view mirror, according to the press release; however, I could not see it in the press cars. I questioned a PR rep, who told me they asked Wassym Bensaid, Chief Software Officer, and were told the cabin camera was removed. If true, how they’ll get to “hands-free” driving remains unanswered.

One thing that WAS answered and will frustrate any current owner is that none of these features will be coming to the gen-1 vehicles. No lane changes. Period. I also got a “no comment” when I asked about trailer assist. These features were advertised as recently as yesterday on Rivian’s website. Philbin, Bensaid, and a number PR folks confirmed with me lane changes WILL NOT be coming to existing vehicles because they “just couldn’t make it work,” which sucks. I talked with RJ Scaringe (CEO) about autonomy 2.5 years ago at the Breckenridge unveil event. He remarked even then that the old hardware was likely capable of level 3-4 autonomy and just needed software improvements. It seems that didn’t end up being remotely true, as we won’t even be getting simple lane changes that have been on every major autonomy platform from every major automaker since 2020. Light your torches, everyone. This new system carries the same suggestion of future potential, but given history, we’ll see…

Lane changes, by the way, are considered part of “Rivian Autonomy Platform+” and, while free to begin with, are suggested to be bundled with other unannounced autonomy features at an additional price in the future. Gen-1 cars will keep all existing autonomy features free (in addition to generalized improvements) but will no longer get new features.



**An Outside Delight**

The most significant changes visually are found inside, but there are some exterior changes too.  Gone are the fog lights, and in their stead are new turn signals. No longer will one of the DRLs turn yellow; they’ll both remain on with a separate, lower, but more visible and brighter amber light. The amber turn signal light on the sideview mirrors has also been repositioned and appears more radiant. The green light bar has been redesigned with ten individual segments. When plugged in, they reflect the state of charge to the nearest 10%. e.g., seven illuminated green sections indicate a 65-74% SOC. These segments are found at both the front and rear of the vehicle; however, the rear bar has some extra tricks up its sleeve. You can display amber-colored animations to help alert and direct traffic flow if you’re stuck on either shoulder (left or right) or even broken down in the middle of the highway. This is an excellent safety feature, but not the only one! Adaptive headlights also make their way to gen -2 vehicles with active headlights that adjust the beam pattern, disabling segments to reduce glare for oncoming traffic while keeping the road illuminated for yourself. It ships later this year as a software update to gen-2 vehicles only.

The tri-motor and quad-motor vehicles come with a new electro-chromatic roof. In addition to heat rejection, it does a pretty good job at blocking out light when you don’t want light rather than having to put up a finnicky sun shade. It’s not the best electrochromic glass I’ve seen and always looks a bit… “frosty,” but it’s a nice option I’d certainly opt for given Rivian’s current glass roofs do f\*\*\*-all when it comes to IR rejection.

New wheels and tires arrive with this refresh. Gone is the 21” (sorry, folks), and in its stead arrive two new 22-inch wheel models. An aerodynamic wheel with a special Pirelli compound looks fantastic (both cover on and off), and a high-performance 22-inch wheel with “a UHP Michelin tire package comes with (and only with) the quad-motor. A new 20-inch wheel and ADV all-season tire also arrive from Goodyear, and I suspect this will be the base-model. It's boring but nice from a ride-quality standpoint.

Oh, blue. Blue’s the new color for the quad-motor configuration. Tri-motor gets yellow, and dual-motor keeps silver. The calipers, badging, and everything in between… all a subtle grey-blue. Oh yeah, Gear Guard Gary also appears as a badge on the quad-motor on the bottom-right of the tailgate. Half the Rivian team hates it, but they’re wrong. It’s absolutely delightful. #TeamGary



**Range Rover? Never Heard Of It.**

Rivian is clearly aiming to position the R1 as a proper luxury vehicle. While the dual-motor and performance dual-motor retain the existing interior (which maintains the “Adventure” name), the tri-motor and quad-motor ship with a new “Ascend” trim. Holy balls, the Ascend trim is next-level. Gone are the chilewich and yellow accents… we’re going plaid. The new plaid design is stunning, with “plaid-style” accents everywhere. The seats are now checkered plaid, the black ash wood inlay is gone, and in its stead is not just the brown ash found on the prior Forest Edge trim, but there’s now a gorgeous walnut and white “driftwood” dependent on the leather color. Speaking of leather, EVERYTHING is wrapped in leather. Every area that had hard plastic has been replaced with stitched leather. The airbag? Stitched leather. Door pocket? Stitched leather. Under-dash storage area? Stitched leather.

There is stitching, piping, and premium-feeling synthetic leather on literally every surface. It feels like the car is $20,000 more expensive inside (more on that in a moment). The two-tone seats are gorgeous; the glossy silver plastic dash accent is now muted grey or bronze and the grab handles and seat headrests have gorgeous plain fabric. Wowzers! It’s stunning inside. In fact, I have a hard time believing this doesn’t add CONSIDERABLE expense; however, I think that when the R2 hits the market, the “cheaper” R1 trims will likely be killed. The R1 is now a luxury car designed to compete with the Range Rovers, the Lexuses, and the Mercedes of the world—not the Model Y, not the Mach-E. This doesn’t quite reach the ultra-luxury market, but it gets really friggin’ close.

Well, save for the sound system. The current “Rivian Elevation” system is part of the high-end Ascend package and it still sounds like crap—at least compared to the prior Meridian system (which was already worse than almost every other car in this price range). If you opt for the “Adventure” trim, you get an even worse sound system than exists today with fewer speakers and black grilles. This news is especially frustrating given that cabin isolation from the new suspension and NVH improvements make the cabin MUCH quieter on the highway. Would be the perfect opportunity to let a great sound system shine. No such luck.

Rivian, priced where you are, the sound system is embarrassing. Do better.



**Software Affair, Mon Frère**

Updates to software are going to make prior-gen owners both really happy and really sad. Coming to all vehicles is a new visual interface design. OK, starting at the binnacle… The widgets on the left (map, tire pressure, efficiency) remain the same, but they’re now windowed in a little “card.” This gives more room for the improved visualization (only on gen-2) in the center, and the speed, gear selection, and power meter remain on the right side (if not a little visually improved).

The main display brings with it a lot of changes. The drive mode pages now show handsome cel-shaded 3D renders running inside of Unreal Engine. You can switch from one drive mode to another and there’s a seamless real-time rendered transition that looks great. Rivian’s very certain this design language will age better than their current implementation, and I have to agree. Sporting the fresh new look is a new typeface. It’s bold, it’s wide, it’s hyper-readable. Gorgeous? Not really, but this is a car. Seeing a bold speedometer looks SO MUCH BETTER than what we’ve got right now. The size of everything is larger, the spacing is more well-considered, and it looks awesome.

The climate controls are redesigned and laid out in a way that makes a lot more sense, but more importantly, there are PRESETS, BABY! Both the driver and passenger can set up two vent presets that can be recalled at any time. Finally, a real solution for multi-driver households. It’s great.

As demonstrated earlier this month, Google Cast will be coming to the fleet (both old and new) so you can watch any video supported by Google Cast (which is most) quickly and easily, right from your smartphone. Unfortunately, such a feature will not come free. This will require Rivian’s new “Connect+” premium connectivity subscription.

Also locked behind a paywall? Apple Music support. Rivian worked with Apple to bring full Dolby Atmos Spatial Audio support. Is it gimmicky? Yes. Is it fun? Also yes. It really does play with all of the speakers available to it and gives a nice “airiness” not found with the other streaming services onboard. Unfortunately, the sound system (as discussed previously) is too lousy to really take advantage of it. Wait... so why isn't this free? Strangely, it seems Connect+ includes an Apple Music subscription. But can you just login to an existing account if you already pay for Apple Music and use that? I couldn't get a clear answer from Rivian; however, I would presume so as Spotify, Tidal, Alexa (weird), and the WiFi hotspot are all moving under the Connect+ umbrella.

If you opt not to pay for Connect+, you’ll still get live navigation (nice), remote vehicle commands, and digital key functionality.

Speaking of digital keys, gen-2 offers support for Apple car key within Apple Wallet. Nice! You can now use your iPhone or Apple Watch to unlock/lock/start the vehicle by holding it wherever you’d have your key card. You can also share keys with friends, manage key permissions, and more. This functionality continues to work even after your iPhone/Watch battery dies (the same cannot be said of the BLE PAAK). Awesome! Unfortunately, this is a hardware thing and only available for gen-2.



**WTF, Monsieur**

Two fairly awesome features that could come to gen-1, seem not to be coming to gen-1.

(1) Ambient lighting. Gen-2 cars can switch between 8 custom-curated colors for the ambient lighting. The color picker has a little cel-shaded art theme and curated sound scape. Absurd, but cute. Why not just a regular RGB color picker? Jeff Hammoud, Chief Design Officer, said: “We don’t want people making their car, say, pink.” This is lame. Let customers make their car whatever color they want.

What about us gen-1 customers? I asked Hammoud, who told me that gen-1 lacked the hardware lighting to make this possible. When I disputed that, saying: “Why? It has RGB lighting. You’ve done two Halloween updates: once red and once green.” He simply replied this feature is gen-2 only. That didn’t seem right, so I asked multiple PR reps. Two asked unnamed higher-ups that confirmed ambient lighting colors were not coming to gen-1. Then, I asked Wassym. He smiled, evaded the question, and said gen-2 makes the lighting possible and that it will not be coming to gen-1. This conflicts with what Wassym has told other people: that gen-2 lighting is better quality and more configurable through software, so, while unclear if it will come to gen-1, it’s technically possible.

Here’s my opinion: let Wassym and his team bring it. I don’t know if there are spectrum or luminance limitations of the gen-1 RGB diodes or not. Perhaps there are. Maybe not every color may come. But at least bring a few of them. We know the colors can change; it has been done before. The ugly, sickly white that exists right now is hardly a great vibe.

(2) Blind spot camera monitoring. In gen-2, when you initiate a lane change, a camera feed of the lane next to you shows up on the left/right side of the binnacle. Many other automakers like Hyundai, Kia, and Tesla do this. It’s awesome. This is something Wassym has publicly stated was forthcoming—both on Reddit and in other Q&As. In Seattle, I was told by a number of people (without explanation)—including from Wassym himself—that blindspot camera monitoring is not coming to gen-1. No reason was given which makes me think its a strategic decision rather than a technical one.

I know the cameras in gen-1 are not as high resolution as gen-2. I know their positioning is potentially less ideal. Bring the feature anyway. It was said to be coming (just like lane changes grrrr) and to pull the rug out at the last moment really sucks.



**A Word, Please...**

I very much got the feeling in Seattle (more than I ever did at Breckenridge in 2021) that many teams are not “on the same page.” I get it… not everybody is PR-trained. Having engineers attend these events instead of just PR and marketing is invaluable. But often, what PR and upper-level management stated directly conflicted with what engineers and department heads said just minutes before/after. Even within PR, I couldn't get consistent answers to some questions.

Rivian is made up of amazing people—from top to bottom. I’ve never been around a group so well-informed, so passionate to share, and so excited about the product they make. That said, I can’t shake the feeling that many decisions being made on “what’s gen-1 vs gen-2” are done from a strategic positioning level and not a technical one.

Please, Rivian, listen to wonderful people like Wassym, who spend countless hours talking to customers, gathering feedback, and encouraging community. Please recognize that these gen-2 cars are engineering marvels and that artificial fragmentation needn’t be required to justify their existence.

These gen-2 cars are evolutionary, yes. But they’re also revolutionary. At nearly every turn, I was blown away by their performance, build quality, and attention to detail. I’m more bullish than ever about Rivian’s path forward, and you should be too.



**Bonus: Camp Kitchen, But For Real...**

The camp kitchen is almost here, finally, again?! Gone is the tunnel kitchen, sink, and water tank. The new design stows away into a briefcase-sized induction range with cutting board, string lights, and not much else. Not nearly as ambitious, but as an R1S owner, I'm all for it! Ships ""later this year."" I'll believe it when I see it.

Sales team inaccurate???
So I have been in the process of reserving an R1T and even put my $1k reserve in.  Well it’s been back and forth last week through email because that’s the only way to talk to someone even after asking them to call me multiple times.  Only reason I would like a call is to speed up the 2 reply daily email to move forward with a buy.  

Well before I would confirm a configuration I wanted to know my trade in on my 19 Tacoma TRD-Off Road since Rivian won’t give you a trade in till you commit to a non refund buy.  Low miles and great condition other than the 4 small recalls that have been addressed. This truck is literally my baby.  I passed my info to the sales guy I was working with and the online customer chat.  Both responded back $30,015. Great I wanted $31k, close enough without a fight especially since that didn’t include the 3k trade in bonus. Well I change my configuration to the Dual Performance since I felt more comfortable with the price with trade in.  

I start the move forward with confirmation and online trade in and my trade in comes back at $26,820. I feel strongly mislead some I was told $30,015 by 2 different ppl.  

With that said if I can’t get the trade in quoted before then I want to cancel my reservation.  Has anyone ever gotten their money back. If so how. 

Demo drive was the best part of this transaction and it’s been all down hill since with the lack of customer service and misleading quote.  It’s really made me think twice.  "

Need purchase advice please
Hi All,

I would love some advice please:) I really want to lease an RS1 instead of purchase bc imo:
-the EV market is unstable
-I will want to trade the car in after about three years to see what other options there are, tech advances, etc. 

However, leasing is not available in my state and Tesla told me that it took them 8 years for my state to approve leasing for them😳

My current lease is expiring. I’m really worried that the R1S won’t hold its value and that I will be underwater in a car loan in three years. I was going to lease something else but the R1S is really the best option for what I want.
Consequently, I’m considering buying a used R1S with low mileage. As soon as Rivian starts leasing in my state I would want to trade it into them or sell it and move into a lease- but this could be anywhere from
2 months -“8 years”..

Any tips or tricks that I should consider in my purchase so that it holds the most value as far as:
-what type of motor (dual or quad)
-what type of build/features? 
-where to buy it

Also, for those who bought before the price hike what did you spend?

Thank you all- hoping to join the club soon lol"

No start button a problem with kids?
I don’t have the delivery yet but I noticed during demo drive that you just press brake and put the car in drive and there you go. There is no start button nor you need to start the car. Since I have couple of toddlers at home, I think I am thinking too much for the fact that you don’t need to start the car!
Is there a kill switch feature in Rivian App where the car won’t move until I enable it?

Edit 1: My main question was if the Rivian App has a kill switch that disables the car until I re-enable it (Like locking Credit Card via App)."

Phone key not working
After latest update phone as key won’t start the truck? It will unlock but won’t start maybe 50% of the time. Wind up using the key card to actually start the truck. Turn Bluetooth off, restart phone, sometimes that fixes it sometimes it doesn’t. Anyone else having this issue or have any advice?"

This Reddit Moderator Went Outside to Rivian’s R2 + R3 Reveal
[*This story is copied from my Medium account in full. If you want to support me, you can view and clap for the article on Medium directly here.*](https://cartergee.medium.com/this-reddit-moderator-went-outside-to-rivians-r2-r3-reveal-0a0cf42251f1)

https://preview.redd.it/w7u8y14gf5nc1.jpg?width=2738&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=00f1e112c3706f3a15780c4b82db5a07c191a21f

Here’s a fun fact that you already know: I moderate the r/Rivian subreddit, an online community of \~80k that really likes the electric vehicle Rivian churns out. Sometimes, when I say this, people assume I work for Rivian. “Oh. No. I and these other two guys do it for free. Like, in our free time.” That’s normally met with a, “OooOOoo… Wow…” or blank stare. But here’s the thing. Community management is important, and bringing people with shared interests together is one of my passions.

There are a lot of great benefits to this. We get to make people happy and provide them a safe place to connect. There’s the opportunity to connect directly with the people who make these vehicles, learning from them directly. And then, every once in a while, a special experience comes up.

Another fun fact: Reddit moderators do, actually, (sometimes) go outside. And that’s exactly what I did when Rivian invited me to attend the reveal of the R2 model yesterday. That’s right. I bravely put on clothes that made me look nice, hopped on a plane from SF to LAX, drove (an unexpected) 2.5hrs (in the pouring rain) to Laguna Beach, and had the opportunity to sit on stage while Rivian CEO, RJ Scaringe, showed off the company’s latest — and then some.

There are a lot of articles about the R2 by now. So I’m not here to give you an informational article. I’m here to tell you what it was like to attend this event, show you my own pictures, and share what stood out to me. In this blog, I don’t want to educate you about vehicle stats (*though this will be unavoidable at points).* Instead, I want to share how I received these reveals as someone who is inundated with Rivian content on the daily, and explain to you what I see behind the steel and lithium that these vehicles are made of.

## The Start of a Tumultuous Journey

It was pouring rain, and I was driving down South I-405 on my way to Laguna Beach for Rivian’s reveal of the R2 — a smaller, more affordable electric SUV launching in 2026. On my way, I found myself at a metaphorical intersection of transportation.

To my left was the Goodyear Blimp. In the lanes next to me I saw a Tesla Model 3, battered semi-truck, and a gas-guzzling pickup hauling auto glass. I was sitting in the BMW I rented on Turo. A Rivian R1S with manufacturer plates was ahead of me, probably headed to the same place I was. To my right was a giant billboard for the Kia EV9.

I was struck by the sheer number of ways people have tried to make transportation better — to varying levels of success and with dramatically unique solutions.

I’m more alert than usual to all of this because in just 24 hrs, I’ll be sitting in the South Theater watching RJ reveal *his* vision for EVs that will revolutionize travel. Looking around me, I’m imagining places Rivian has drawn inspiration: the boldness of the blimp, the practicality of the omnipresent American pickup, or the opportunity to reduce the harm from the exhaust all around me. The billboard for the EV9 shows me that Rivian isn’t the only one feeling inspired.

https://preview.redd.it/5c3rkauhf5nc1.jpg?width=2719&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=203792abb23e7295dae711d3265fb43f1847037a

But what is this inspiration worth if Rivian isn’t around to realize it?

While I believe in Rivian, and I don’t think they’ll go belly up, I do recognize that the company is in a similarly precarious position to early Tesla. They have a successful, expensive model out that appeals to a limited demographic, are burning through cash, and quite literally need their next, more affordable model to be successful. The success of the company hinges on the reveal I’m driving to.

There’s much written about the EV valley of death Rivian is currently trudging through. Complicating things: EV sales are up overall, but so too are interest rates, and YoY growth rates have slowed.

It’s going to be tough. Rivian plans to be gross margin profit positive this year, but to get there, they need to shut down the plant for several weeks. They don’t plan to produce more vehicles than they did last year (even though deliveries may be up). The plant building this new vehicle has only just broken ground, costs $5B, and won’t be spitting out R2s until 2026.

I’m fascinated by these challenges. I’m into this electric car company like other people (who are very different from me) are into football teams. So, reasonably, when Rivian invited me to the reveal of the R2, I jumped at the opportunity to glean everything I could from the event, staff, and to be the first to see these vehicles live.

So, what did I learn? What could I tell about not only the R2, but also the future of Rivian — a brand I admire deeply for their impact migrating folks away from large, polluting ICE vehicles?

Buckle your seatbelt. I’ll tell you everything.

## Respite and Reflection

I made it to the event greeted by the familiar sight of those iconic headlights and got a bit of rest. As I fell asleep, I got stressed out about work. I’m working a lot right now, and I was trying to not stress too much about what I would strike off my to-do list in the early hours before the event.

This felt silly.

Here I am, in my posh hotel room, stressing while RJ and his teams are about to either rebuild faith in their vision or whiff to catastrophic results.

One notable tragedy of my stay was that I forgot my toothpaste and was given toothpaste *pellets* that you chew and then brush your teeth with. I did not know these existed. I regret learning that they exist. They are awful.

https://preview.redd.it/y8kh3blkf5nc1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=418427f1f8ef8d4893f271a0a08ed10418d33c4c

“Sure,” I thought, “RJ is probably having a tough time sleeping ahead of the biggest moment for his company yet, but at least he has normal toothpaste as opposed to this apocalyptic torture device in the form of a powdery white pellet.”

I was comforted knowing that RJ and I were both having an equally challenging time. I closed my eyes and drifted into dreamland, ready for the day ahead.

## Two Headlights at the End of the Tunnel

After brushing my teeth *with another toothpaste pellet*, I hopped in a Lyft, got a big coffee, met my other moderators (*they are great, I love them*), and got in line at the South Theater right next to the beach which Rivian has turned into a dedicated hub.

The energy was electric. *(Are you tired of these puns yet?)* Rivian employees were surprised we were there so early and appeared to get a jolt of energy *(sorry not sorry)* at our enthusiasm.

Standing in line, I checked in with myself about what I realistically expected from this event:

* Hear about Rivian’s progress so far
* See the R2 and learn its specifications
* Get to check out the R2 close up

Ho boy. If I only knew what we were getting ourselves into. Not to spoil things, but the R2 wasn’t the big reveal.

When we got inside I was seated on stage with \~5 other community leaders in the Rivian space — including the Rivian Club of America and a very badass woman who competed in the Rebel Rally in her R1. Everyone else who wasn’t press was in the mezzanine. How did I secure such a seat? Your guess is as good as mine.

Sorry, what I meant was, “Your guess *isn’t* as good as mine.” The night before, marketing asked the Reddit mods to pick a number between 1 and 15 and I guessed right to secure a coveted stage seat.

Here’s what you’re told when you come to a press event that’s pivotal to the eventual success of a company whose stock price recently plummeted after earnings and whose success is hinging on the content in the next \~30 min:

* You may not have any bags, water, coffee, or anything else with you.
* You may not leave your seat once the presentation starts.
* Be yourselves and cheer. We invited *you* for a reason.
* You’re in RJ’s line of sight for a lot of this. I felt an unexpected responsibility when I was told this. I committed to encouraging eyes and a wide smile. And I was happy to do it.
* Silence your cell phones or you will be killed on the spot. *(Editor’s note: the author embellished the consequence)*

I was starting to get pretty hyped. As a musical theater nerd — that’s right, I like big pickup trucks *and* Sondheim #multifaceted — I couldn’t help but analyze the production. There was clearly a turnstile in the middle of the stage and a serious camera setup. The screen was obviously going to split down the middle to reveal the R2, and I started imagining it. My heartbeat increased and I could feel the jitters of the Rivian staff all around me.

While I was waiting, I reflected on just exactly what I was doing here. Here I am in Laguna Beach after paying my own way to a multi-billion dollar company’s product reveal. And I’m expected to cheer. And I *want* to cheer. Do I love capitalism *this* much?

Well. Listen. We live in a society. I’m not the guy who is going to say we should break down all our systems and rebuild them or that we should tear up all our roads to replace them with bike lanes and trains (*though a lot more of that second part would be amazing and I support it*). But I *am* that guy who thinks we need to electrify our personal transit methods. Whether that’s hybrids or full electric, we need to do it. And to do it, we need to give buyers really compelling options to get them to deal with the inconveniences of EV ownership today–like charging.

I viewed my role here as someone who could help push that forward. Rivian was about to invite a whole lot more people to stop burning dinosaur blood.

RJ took the stage in front of Rivian’s motto: Keep the world adventurous forever. It resonates with me. It’s optimistic, aspirational, and easy to connect with. As someone who used to drive his 4Runner through the Sierras and now drives his R1T on the same routes, I personally feel that I’m doing my small part to more responsibly experience what Earth has to offer.

*Note:*[ *EVs are better for the environment than gas vehicles, no matter their size, even though they start with a larger carbon footprint*](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/business/electric-vehicles-carbon-footprint-batteries.html)*. While it takes larger EVs longer to become a positive influence than smaller ones, they are still net-better. Offering consumers larger, more capable vehicles encourages folks with the most polluting vehicles to consider electrifying.*

RJ talked a bit about Rivian’s accomplishments, showed aspirational marketing photos and videos of folks exploring, and shared how excited he was to be here. All expected. There’s a lot of press here.

But there was one part that really stuck out to me. He mentioned how he wants to create vehicles that inspire people to be their best selves.

My Reddit moderator brain latched onto this as a contrast to Elon. It’s no secret that Elon’s volatile persona is harming the Tesla brand. He’s echo-chambering himself on Twitter and removing content moderation policies to cater to bullies. In my experience moderating r/Rivian, the Tesla hive mind is flatly toxic. If we ever need to remove a post or comment, there’s almost always a Tesla connection.

With this line, RJ continued to separate himself from an increasingly extremist Musk. I viewed it as extremely intentional to further drive the wedge between an optimistic Rivian future and the dystopian CyberTruck vision. It was punchy and a jab — RJ’s, “When they go low, we go high,” moment. I don’t know if Rivian viewed it that way. But they must have, right?

Perhaps the biggest contrast was that RJ seemed prepared. Comparing this to the CyberTruck reveal, it’s pretty obvious to me which CEO I’d want to work for.

## We R Excited for R2

FINE. I’LL TALK ABOUT THE VEHICLES. Gosh…

The screen split in half (called it), the R2 was driven out, and it was rotated on the turnstile so we could all get a good look at it. Slam. Dunk. Looking like its significantly more expensive sibling the R1S, the R2 is what people were hoping for. The cheers were so loud that someone’s Apple Watch started calling 911 because it thought there was an emergency.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/v6qjg9pxf5nc1.jpg?width=2738&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0d64b5b4762a7001f4239cda8df78ed909b339b1

Again, there is so much written about the specs of this vehicle. So instead I’ll share the five main things that stuck out to me:

* It’s only slightly bigger than a Honda CRV and the Model Y, but with significantly more headroom and storage.
* Starting at $45,000 before any rebates, this thing is priced better than expected. Sure, it will change a bit by launch in 2026, but uh. Winner.
* Deliveries start in the first half of 2026, earlier than expected. Rivian is doing this by utilizing their existing Normal, IL plant. The original plan was to build the R2 at a new plant in Georgia which hasn’t been built yet. Rivian is pausing work and capital expenditures there (saving $2.5B) to ramp up a new line for R2 in their current factory. Suddenly that multi-week shut down of the plant announced in their earnings call makes a *lot* more sense. I wish I saw that coming. You could almost feel investors in the room let out a sigh of relief.
* This thing is for suburbanites. “Adventure” when looking at the R2 is a trip to Whole Foods with three screaming kids. It’s a smart marketing pivot from their much more capable R1 series which was showng climbing rock faces and splashing through streams when they were unveiled.
* The drop window in the back a la Toyota’s 4Runner is genius. I firmly believe that the 4Runner’s drop window is a deeply beloved feature and incorporating it into the R2 will attract current 4Runner owners to convert to Rivian just like I did.

*Note: I've run out of images for this post. Sorry! The rest are on my Medium.*

Cool! Expectations met. I saw the vehicle. It had great specs. I am satiated and feeling good. I have a sense that Rivian has just built confidence and secured their future.

But then…

## Siblings

When RJ said that the R2 had a sibling, we screamed. It was involuntary. We all expected a little two door pickup. The night before at dinner, we had all imagined that the R2 may very follow the R1 model of have a “T”ruck and a “S”UV.

When that “3” showed up on the screens… We stood up. We screamed. It didn’t matter I was told to scream. I would have screamed if I was told I wasn’t allowed to. When this little hatchback R3 drove out, real, and feet from me I had ‘That’s So Raven’ vision of this thing all over SF. Then I thought about the Fisker Ocean that parks on my street and wondered what its owner would think of this.

The fact that no one saw this coming says a lot about Rivian. They’re disciplined. They’re calculating. They’re professional. It builds confidence.

We don’t know pricing, but we know it’s going to be cheaper than the R2.

## “One More Thing”

I remember where I was when I watched Steve Jobs, “One More Thing” for the first time. It was Chesapeake, Virginia. I was a teenager in my mom’s office watching a livestream on the internet we got not all that long ago. It was my first, “Oh shit. I love technology.” moment. Part of me always yearned to be present for a moment like that.

“One more thing…” RJ said. This will sound dramatic, but time slowed.

If you watch [this video](https://www.threads.net/@prcgibson/post/C4OR71mPREM) with sound on, you’ll hear what I can only describe as a newly gained core memory.

A third model rolled out, the R3X — a more capable version of the R3 and oh mannnnnn do I think it looks neat. The side mirrors, the two-toned seats, the cork dashboard… It’s neat. It’s so neat.

## Energized.

I gotta wrap this up.

Rivian needed the R2. But they overdelivered at this event, showing not only their near future, but their long term future as well. Despite the climate of EVs overall, it showed me that Rivian is solidifying its place as the visionary leader in the EV place. These vehicles have a perspective — thank you lead designer Jeff Hammoud—and a character. They are uniquely Rivian and everyone is invited.

When we got up to look up close at the vehicles, we were all stunned.

I’ll include pictures I took at the end of this article so you can see them, but I wanted to close with what the feeling in the room was:

Confident. Relieved. A bit of exhaustion from the Rivian staff. Inspired.

Rivian needed this. Up until this event, it felt like Rivian’s battery may have been running out (*last one, promise).* This event fast charged them (*I lied)* into the next couple of years that will, undoubtedly, be rough. Remember, they’re still in that EV Valley of Death. But if any company is going to emerge from it, it’s going to Rivian with their R2, R3, and R3X in tow.

R1T Tailgate - Right side won’t latch
Started last week- the right side won’t latch. The left side does, so the tailgate stays up. Shows on the infotainment that the tailgate is up, but says it’s open and proximity sensors are disabled. Tried reboots with no luck. Tried with and without the tonneau cover no luck.

Next service appointment is in April. Love everything about the truck with the exception of the service being so far out. Guess I have three months without proximity sensors which is a shame."

Feature Request x2 & First Drive Review
Hi everyone,

This is in hopes that Rivian is listening (I also submitted it in my test drive review...so they *do* know...) and I'm curious to see what ideas other owners or potential owners have, so here goes:

Why am I not seeing reviews about how wonderful the ambient/accent lighting is to use? More specifically, why can’t the user choose from a palette of sixteen million different colors via a wheel in the Rivian app or onscreen? With pre-programmed and user-programmable light shows and presets? Hell maybe even a strobe lighting effect that can only be activated in show and tell mode when you want to rave? 

Door ajar? Its lights should turn red to notify the user…or whatever color I specify. Can you see what I’m getting at? Let meeeeeeeeeeee control the colors (in the whiniest voice I can muster)! 

Yeah when I rode in my buddies BMW the other day I still thought the red accent lighting was sick, but it felt a bit stale since I had been staring at it for 6 years. He can’t change the color…but when Rivian owns the software stack and has demonstrated that there are indeed color changing accent lights (see posts on Halloween mode) then I am going to have to ask for a bit more than the “high” “med” and “low” settings currently available. I mean, come on! It’s disappointing that I won’t be able to enjoy some soothing light therapy after a stressful day at work. What if I’m going on a date with some smokeshow who tells me that they get real turned on by hot pink mood lighting and dry up  in the presence the usual incandescent spectrum? The different colors can have an effect on peoples moods and there is still untapped potential in the system. 

I know Rivian has had a lot on their plate with their first deliveries during the pandemic and with building the new enduro motors, and that this is me being extremely critical of a relatively minor feature in the grand scheme, but these are the type of lux features that their discerning audience is looking for. We no longer live in 2003. It’s 2023 (almost 2024). Please allow user customization in a future update. 

Another feature request : **Low Power Mode** \- this my attempt at rebranding Teslas “creep mode;” a name which I always despised (although if you want to be consistent with or more disgusting than Tesla, we could call it “Stalker” or “Pedophile” mode). Regardless, the feature has more potential than what Tesla did with it (as far as I know - I’m not a Tesla owner).  

This mode could come in handy in many situations. I have read multiple reviews documenting how people feel unsure about how hard they can tap the accelerator when trying to park the Rivian (forward or reverse). Why not let the user specify a limit to the horsepower or force at the wheels so that they can inconsequentially slam on the pedal in touchy situations? Specifically, they should be able to set their own default power setting for Reverse, since it’s unlikely that anyone will ever need to exceed 10-15 mph. This might even be handy for rock crawling traction control and more likely for gridlock traffic. Limiting horsepower and top speed could also allow a degree of comfort if your teenager asks to use it or if a valet is going to park it. 

I recall a comment from RJ in an interview referring to such a feature as “simulating inefficiencies,” but maybe a different spin on it could be that the company is just leveraging technology. After all, I can’t dial down the horsepower on my combustion engine before handing the keys over to my irresponsible youth, but this is something that could easily be achieved in a future software update. The biggest situation where I feel that this feature would be handy is for gridlock traffic. It's literally the only time I would rather run ICE over EV simply because ""creeping"" allows me to not hold the brake so often. My ICE car tops out at a certain speed (maybe 5 mph) when idling, and sometimes traffic is going 7 mph so I have to occasionally tap the gas. I should be able to set the Rivian to 7 mph or whatever speed in order to flow as smoothly as possible with the traffic. Perhaps this is a cruise control feature that I didn’t get to check out during my test drive (following distance?), but as above, I’d like to see the feature be a bit more comprehensive. 

Now for the brown nosing…it was the best car I’ve ever driven. It felt like a sports car but somehow weighs 7000 pounds. The steering feel is amazing (I remember a lot of reviews mentioning that and damn it’s like butter). The view through the moonroof from the second row is AMAZING! The vented seats froze my ass (although it is winter here in South FL). I also recall with clarity when I first started driving how annoying it was to always hold down the brake pedal for traffic lights, and I enjoyed the one pedal driving so much in this respect.  I was always a believer, which is why I put down my deposit in 2022. Rivian is killing it! Keep up the good work! 

&#x200B;

TL/DR: I want better user control of the accent/ambient lighting and a better ""creep"" mode than Tesla. The R1S drives like a dream."

Manual Tonneau Cover Permanently Locked?
Just received my tonneau cover yesterday, and installed it today. No instructions in the box so I installed it based on a few videos I watched on Youtube. Very straightforward to do initially.

The problem now though is that it won’t move. I can’t pull it out, and I can’t see any buttons or toggles or clasps to unlock it.

I clicked the two clips on either side and they popped out, not sure if that’s the plan or not but that was very easy to do.

Started pulling the tag and it popped right out. The tonneau cover is now completely locked in place and I’m even more at a loss as to what to do!

Clearly this is some form or user error but I’m baffled as to what I’m supposed to do differently.

Will attempt to fix the clips later today but if this is the overall design I’m not impressed.

Anyone know how to fix this generally?

Truck has been unlocked the entire time, with the tailgate unlocked and down."

R1S Perf DM Max Pack 21"" Wheels, 1st Week Impressions..<Long!>
Hi Everyone,  


New R1S owner here. Cross posting here from the [rivianforums.com](https://rivianforums.com) post as well to share my thoughts. Its been 5-6 days since pickup and I have driven it for about 500 miles, so I am posting my first set of thoughts on the R1S. I wanted to take some time and be deliberate with my thoughts. Would love your feedback and suggestions. This is going to be a long one..but I am excited and have a lot to ask and share  


TLDR: Great truck that still feels hamstrung by some quirky design and development choices  


**My spec is a Perf Dual Motor with Max Pack and 21"" wheels.**  


**Delivery/ Pick up Experience:**  


I arrived at the Rivian Center (which is about 20 miles from my home) about 5 mins late (3:35 PM instead of 3:30 PM) and was checked in. They had a busy day with over 20 deliveries so it took them another 30 mins to get to me. Once my turn came, the time taken to sign the papers, trade in my car and get to my new Rivian was only 15 mins.  


The associate walked me through the basics of the car. Unfortunately it was getting dark, so I didnt have time to really inspect the car thoroughly at pickup. But dont worry, they understand this and the associate told me I have time to document all the issues and raise tickets for them. I did a quick examination of the exterior, interior, accessories (flashlight, camp speaker, mats, etc.) and could find only 3 small issues of minor panel rotation for which we raised tickets immediately. More on this later. But my recommendation is do take a check list but don't sweat it if you can’t check everything at delivery. Take 4 hours over the next weekend and ensure you go through everything in the peace and quiet of your driveway.  


Overall the delivery experience was decent. Definitely not premium (our family is coming from the Porsche and Mercedes dealership experience which is stellar)..but again IMHO Rivian deliver a premium experience on the most valuable commodity, Time. Everything is quick, easy and not painful. The traditional dealer model of gymnastics between the salesmen and the finance guys is dead as a dodo. Rivian can improve the front office experience though..the check in process and just making you feel welcome is severely lacking  


**Driving the R1S**  


Over the last few days I have driven the R1S for about 500 miles. In this time I have done, highway, city driving and long twisty mountainous sections as well  


\- The car is well suspended for its weight. The stiff setting is quite good and composed and helps it handle like our erstwhile Cayenne in twisty roads. The R1S is 1500 lbs heavier and of course doesn’t have the handling pedigree of the Porsche. So, thats a very very high watermark and praise. It still cant handle like a proper sports car (you notice it especially with the mass being flung around in tight darty corners) but given its size and intent its amazing what the Rivian engineers tuned it for  
\- The accelerator pedal calibration for 1-pedal driving is pretty spot on. I was bummed initially that it didnt have the creep mode as a setting, but the creep/ stop behavior is dialed into the pedal. You have to treat it like a potentiometer   
\- The seat and ergonomics are spot on. No complaints whatsoever. Good reach, great support, firm bolstering. I do wish they had put in thigh extensions to help under thigh support during long highway slogs  
\- The HVAC is two zones only and is transversely managed. Really daft design. I really hope they can unlock true 3 or 4 zone HVAC with an update.  
\- I have driven it in All Purpose mode pretty much all the time and it’s the perfect mode. The rear motor kicks in on demand otherwise its mostly FWD and it drives very well  
\- One thing that I never appreciated in my test drives or haven’t seen being spoken about much is the turning circle. This IS a nimble car. The turning radius is pretty tight..especially considering that this is a huge vehicle. It’s 3-4” wider and 11” longer than our Cayenne! And still manages to turn in less or same space as our Cayenne  
\- The suspension while admirable in its handling traits, does exhibit some funkiness.  
A.) When going over speed bumps in soft mode the front seems to buckle a bit too hard before the spring helps out. Doesn’t happen in the stiff mode.  
B.) The rear suspension seems to have a knocking sound. I think its the air bladders pumping up or releasing air. But don’t know for sure. I have raised a ticket with Rivian for this  
C.) The car seems to have a mind of its own regarding whether it wants to go to kneel mode on park or not  


**Interiors, Amenities, Charging and Living with it**  


\- The interiors of the car are very thoughtfully designed with a clean but usable aesthetic. I like it. There are small quibbles like the charging pad..but honestly I am going create a silicone channel to sort of hold the phone in place with some bathroom caulk and see if that works before spending $100 on a mag puck accessory  
\- The headlights are quite good. Great spread, cut off and even lighting in the beam. Two callouts:  
1.) I would love for them to reduce the color temp by about 500 kelvin to be closer to 4500-5000K. It feels its about 5500-6000K right now. A little less blue would be better  
2.) The auto high beam has ADD it seems to jump up to high and low randomly on dark roads. The saving grace is that when there is oncoming traffic it stays dipped. I hope again they fix it in a patch  
\- The Rivian designed sound system is amazing. The clarity and detail is very very good. The channel separation is again very good. If you listen to classical, jazz and vocals you won’t be disappointed. The base is tight but lacking in oomph/punch and air  
\- Rivian bless your heart for not aping Tesla in omitting grab handles. They are very helpful because even in the lowest mode the R1S is pretty high. A set of side steps are a must IMHO..especially if your family has older folks or vertically challenged folks  
\- The seats are very well cooled and ventilated. As aforementioned, great bolstering and support  
\- I am a numbers nerd and I am super enjoying this whole new set of math I have to do around charging, efficiency and experimenting what impacts how much. I do wish they had more numbers for me to crunch. As far as I can see the only real time data I get is the last 15 min average line graph on the left of the instrument cluster. Is there anything else? I really wish they had a menu that shows me how much HVAC usage or acceleration or heating batteries or something else is contributing to or taking away from my overall range  
\- I have installed a suite of apps including ABRP, EvGo, Electrify America, ChargePoint and ElectraFi. Anything I am missing?  


**Quibbles/ Observations/ Areas of improvement:**  


\- I understand that Rivian chose to make it 2WD for efficiency, but I am sure they can alter it between FWD and RWD. In my daily driving it’s mostly FWD and 4WD is summoned pretty seamlessly as needed. But I have seen that front motors are always running a bit hotter than the rears. Seems like a recipe for wearing them out prematurely than the rears  


\- The HVAC is a conundrum for me. Why they chose to not put in a heat pump in todays day and age is beyond me. The transverse management of the HVAC without any separate temp setting for the middle row is pretty darn stupid  


\- Is it me or the second row seats don't go back to the original setting when. you slide them forward to access the third row? The second row seat backs also seem very heavy in pushing back to a recline position  


\- The vehicle is pretty tall and heavy..so I am not expecting miracles in the form of efficiency. But I have mostly averaged 1.8-2.1 mi/ kWh. If I am driving on the highway at 75 mph (indicated, speedo has a 2mph optimistic error), cabin set to 70 deg and on cruise control then I get 2.25-2.3 mi/ Kwh. So by that measure it’s a range of \~320 miles. Pretty abysmal. To get the EPA stated range of 400 miles I need to get an efficiency of 2.8 mi/ kWh which I dont see happening at all unless I keep it at 60-65  


\- A big frustration for me has been the proximity unlock. Picture this..you have a new car..excited to show it to you family and friends. Walk up to the car and it wont unlock..you fumble with the app and it says 'waking' .. 30 agonizing seconds later the car unlocks. Uggh. Rivian fix this!! Unacceptable.. (I know this is a known issue..but just venting here..bear with me)  


\- Finally, My biggest frustration so far has been DC fast charging. Surprisingly, it’s not what I feared. Every DC fast charger I have gone to worked flawlessly..Electrify America, EvGo..all had stations open, working and charged the Rivian. But as has been documented here, the charge curve is shite. The R1S is theoretically capable of charging at 220 Kwh..of course that’s only for a short period. I dont expect it to sustain that. But here is my experience. I went to 2 DC fast chargers..both 350 kW one Electrify America and one EvGo. The R1S was at 38% and 28% SOC respectively. It started at 190-175 kWh charging and dropped in a min to a steady 145-150 kWh. The moment it hit 50% it dropped to 100-110 kWh and when it crossed 70% it went to 70s. I topped it up to 75% SOC and left. Took me about 35-40 mins each time. Home charging seems to be working well and I think that’s the way ahead till Rivian can come up with a solve. And I do sincerely hope they do..because this is a kick arse road tripping car and it would be a shame to not leverage it so  


Ok..thats a long ramble. Thank you for enduring so far. I will shut up now. I have a big roadtrip coming up shortly with about 1700 miles of driving. I will post a detailed roadtrip report after that. If you guys have any questions specific to the R1S, Perf Dual Motor or the Max Pack..please feel free to ping..I can try answer them"

[update] R1S accident/repairs
So back in early August I was rear ended when I tried to not run into a construction barrel that had been struck by another vehicle. 

Initial estimate was a little over 18k for repairs before the Rivian authorized body shop started tearing it down. When the body shop did start on the truck they found a further 25k in damages, bringing the total to over 43k to repair.

I called my insurance company and asked why the truck was not totaled out. I was told there would have to be a further 20k in damages for that to happen. The insurance company was nice enough to extend my rental car coverage for another 30 days.

On the 5th of October I got an email from the body shop that a structural component they need is back ordered, with no timeline as to when it may come in.

I reached out to Rivian to see if they can give me a loaner or help pay for my rental. They said there is nothing they can do. 

So now I’m stuck renting a Toyota Camry for $30/day while also still paying for my Rivian. There is no end in sight. I’m not sure what I can do. I keep getting asked by my wife and family “when is your truck going to be fixed?” When I tell them I have no idea, they say I should do something about it, but I don’t know what to do. Who should I reach out to? I don’t think a lawyer can really do anything. 

I’m in Michigan which is a no fault state, so the person that hit me insurance company won’t do anything. 

I’m completely frustrated with this situation."

Latest update disabled working tonneau.
Got the prompt to download the latest update yesterday morning. It installs, I hope in and head to work. Love the new gauges and the UI layout. Get to work (construction) and try to open powered tonneau and it won’t open. I hear the motor start and stop. I go in the truck and verify the only option is a close tonneau button. Well mine is already closed. Anyone had this happen before? Hard rest soft reset did not fix. Everything seems like it works other than the tonneau thinks it’s open."

Noises??!! Etc.
Greetings.

When you start driving do you hear random creaks/noises? Almost sounds like the ride is adjusting to height?

Sorry I’m a little picky but I’ve had a bad delivery experience, etc.

Pre delivery issues of mine won’t get solved until October/ December.

Apologize in advanced if I’m being too finicky. I understand new car manufacturer etc.
Like leather on steering wheel a stitch is popping out. 

Service (800 number) have been very nice but rather want a speedy date.

Besides all that. I love the r1s. It’s a sick vehicle. Can’t wait to get out there.

Also the navigation app is bs. I don’t think it takes into consideration of traffic. Waze was like 38 min , Rivian said 10. I was like no traffic on Lincoln Blvd in la at 4pm?! Let’s do it! Wrong.

Anyways. Enjoy your R1T/S"

Front License Plate Protector With SnapPlate?
Got a SnapPlate mount for front license plate, but noticing the plate is already starting to bend a little, so I’m considering an additional protector etc that goes around the border of it. Anyone have experience with a low profile/thin protector that won’t further interfere with front camera/sensors? I’m considering just grabbing the one from Rivian meant for the back and trying to make it work, but open to other ideas. TIA!"

R1S Service
Will start this by stating that I absolutely love my R1S.  Now I’m starting to wonder if it was a reject as it was the only LE in the store at the time VIN 12XXX.

Current issues:  

1.  Keycards don’t work (I believe it is the reader in the vehicle (flipper easily reads keycards).  Before you ask, yes it supposedly  worked one time during delivery when the Rivian teammate was showing me the vehicle, but I’m beginning to think that it may have been the key fob that triggered the vehicle to unlock.

2.  Air compressor does not work…like the LCD is blank and it doesn’t turn on.  During delivery day I assumed it had to be turned on similar to the outlet and didn’t think much of this. 

3.  There are small paint issues all over the corners of the vehicle and some areas where it looks like nicks and others where I can see paint  contaminants.  This breaks my heart every time I notice them.

4.  Paint is peeling off one of the door hinges and all of the bolts securing the doors to the frame (do you guys see this too?). No, I didn’t check the inside of the doors when I took delivery.  

5.  Started noticing several areas where plastic panels/pieces have rough edges, these are not that visible and don’t bother me much.

I have a service appointment scheduled and the representative I spoke to said that I may have to have my vehicle sent to a collision center to fix all of the paint issues…Rivian Blue. 

Everyone I have dealt with was professional, but it’s just frustrating.  

My goal posting this is to see if others have had similar issues/experiences. 

Keeping my fingers crossed that this won’t require a body shop :/"

High Cost of L2 Charger Install when the House Panel Isn’t Up to Snuff (Austin)
Just wanted to share my situation as something of a PSA / FYI data point as well as an opportunity for those who know more than me to offer feedback. 

I’m picking up my R1S in a few days now.  A couple weeks back when I locked in and went through the steps I started looking into the home charger install options in my area. For background, I have a single family home in the North Austin area that was built in 1992.  The exterior panel and meter are located on the opposite side of the house to our garage where I would like to install our L2 charger.  We purchased the Rivian wall mount which can run off various amp lines, but preferably 60a which allow 48a charging current with the required20% differential. 

Anyway it turns out that our external panel needs to be upgraded to support either a 50 or 60 amp dedicated line.  The quote to upgrade the panel is $4900 on top of the installation price for the dedicated circuit. Also city of Austin is running 7-8 weeks out on the required inspection for the upgrade. Eesh.  

Then there’s the quote for the dedicated line.  The line will have to run through two separate attics that are offset and connected only by a small space that a human can’t fit into but pipes etc can be run through.  The second attic is above the garage so the line would run down the wall from there to the charger location.   I’ve gotten two estimates: one for a dedicated 50a line at $2900 plus tear down of a bedroom wall for accessing the conduit (which they won’t fix and will require an additional contractor to repair and repaint); the other was just generally “at least $2600” and no word yet on whether that will require breaking through the bedroom wall.  

So TLDR we are looking at around $7-8k minimum and up to ~$10k to install a L2 charger in a reasonably modern home in Austin.  I’m not buying the R1S just to save money on gas, but obviously this is a large additional investment of time and money beyond the large investment required to obtain the car that I’ll confess I hadn’t really looked into when I signed up.  

Of course I’ll also be future proofing the house a bit against new energy appliance requirements in the years ahead but not going to lie that it hurts.  

Be interested in other thoughts or observations about my situation in particular or the issue more generally."

Was supposed to pick up Rivian tomorrow, instead they lost a customer for life
So I’m still raging from the 8 phone calls I had with them today so I’ll try to keep my emotions in check. First, I put $25k cash down + trade in. This will be important later, just getting it out of the way.

So my trade ins registration expired a month back and I haven’t been driving it bc I was trying to sell it. Figured I’d sell it before I’d get the call to schedule my pickup. In which case I would have increased my down payment by another $20k just to have a comfortable monthly payment. I had all the docs uploaded and all my steps finished. 

Then today my guild calls me… (paraphrase, not verbatim but damn close)

Guide: yeah so there’s a small problem, the reg is expired, we need active reg

Me: why? You guys will turn around and sell the car to a partner used car dealership or you’ll run it through an auction. I’ve worked at car dealerships before. End of the road whoever buys it will need to pay reg again regardless”

Guide: Actually our “disposition partners” who sell the vehicles require it

Me: who are your “partners” so I can do some homework and verify that

Guide: we won’t share that information with you. It’s policy.

Me: ok, well where in the contracts/agreements I signed does it say my trade ins reg needs to be current? What if it’s non-operational instead?

Guide: I checked internally, it cannot be non-operational, and actually in the 19 page purchase agreement you signed it states it needs valid registration.

Me: you sure? Where?

Guide: it’s there, I don’t know exactly where, it’s 19 pages. But that aside, you couldn’t legally operate the vehicle to get it here without reg..

Me: ok well if that’s the case I’ll go take care of it since that’s what I agreed to… but for your information of course I could get it there without reg. I can tow it or bring it on a trailer.

Guide: but that would cost more than reg

Me: unless you know someone with a tow or trailer like I do 

Guide: …I guess

Me: anyway, I’ll call you back

End of call. I go and review ALL the signed paperwork. Turns out he was full of shit. Lie #1 for those who want to keep score.

Call #2

Me: so yeah turned out there’s no language ANYWHERE to validate what you told me on my last call. 

Guide: oh well I talked directly with our trade in team and they said they won’t do it without valid reg

Me: well, no where was it disclosed in our agreement that those are terms that need to be met to complete the purchase process. Any steps/requirements that need to be met need to be clearly disclosed so I am aware of the agreement I am signing. You are now telling me a new contract term was created out of thin air by your trade in team. This needed to be disclosed. 

Guide: we’ll no technically that’s a cost associated w the dmv, not us, so there’s no need for us to disclose that cost

Me: right, that cost is not brought upon me by rivian, but the condition of a valid reg needed to be disclosed to make a trade in eligible does. You cannot introduce terms after I have already signed and acknowledged all the terms in writing. This is pretty basic contract law. If it’s not in the contract, it’s not a condition.

Guide: …ok so do you want to cancel?

Me: let me think about it, this is leaving a bad taste in my mouth

Call #3 

Me: ok let’s just get this over with, I’ve waited 2 years. I’ll just open a case for arbitration after to get that $500 back and credited to me

Guide: ok all I need you to do is go to dmv website, pay for your registration, take a screenshot of the whole page and you’ll officially be done and good to

Me: thank god. JUST TO CONFIRM, THIS IS THE LAST STEP AND ALL I NEED TO DO TO GET MY CAR TOMORROE, CORRECT?

Guide: YUP, make sure you get that in by the next hour, that’s the cutoff and you’ll be all set to pick up your rivian tomorrow as planned

Me: No problem

End call. I go to DMV do EXACTLY what was asked…

Phone rings… 

Guide: hey sooooo the screenshot of the receipt isn’t enough. They need the physical copy

Me: but you literally told me that’s all I needed to do. I’m not trying to be rude but wth man?? You already flat out lied about the language in the contract saying I need valid reg and you also told me, and confirmed, that the dmv receipt is sufficient 

Guide: yeah… welllllll.. they want to be extra careful since you mentioned arbitration..

Lie #2 for those keeping track

Me: *trying to keep my fucking cool* listen… go back and tell them the following “the customer is having a horrible experience with this, he’s waited 2 years, he’s gonna cancel.. he said he’s not gonna arbitrate over it he just wants to get this done and over with, let’s do him a solid and make this a horrible experience for him”

Guide: that’s what I already told them

Me: dude put me on the phone or three way someone who has the authority to make this happen

Guide: we don’t do that, I’m the sole point of contact

At this point I’m LIVID

Me: ok so how long til I get my money back if I cancel.. 24? 48 hours?

Guide: 3 weeks, we’ll mail you a check

Me: not acceptable. That’s a loan so that check better come back with interest. You could easily wire it back to me.

Guide: sorry, that’s the way it is

I get off the call angry af

I call back

Me: let me talk your manager, I’m gonna cancel and I need my money back in the same time frame it took your guys to get it. 24-48 hours. If I come across another car I need that money available now, I can’t say “I’ll pay the down payment in 3 weeks” so let me talk to your manager

Guide: ok I’ll escalate to my lead. They’ll call you within 24-48 hours to see if you want to cancel

For any Rivian employees at corporate who might read this… if this is how you start a relationship there is nothing in the world that will make me do business with you. EVER. It’s a matter of principal. To those who got your RS1’s congrats, I’ll call y’all the lucky ones. But if this is how they treat someone buying a $90k car after waiting 2 years.. I’ll go buy a Tesla. God knows how bad the experience would be if I ever had to get my car taken in for service…

Edit: one of the cool things I thought about rivian is that rivian owners aren’t like Elon Stan’s.. no one has said “yeah lying to your face is unethical” instead im a Karen. So since I don’t have time to respond to all those comments here’s a preemptive ead for those who are gonna comment like I’m the crazy one. If I told you one thing and did the exact opposite you’d be mad too. Y’all buggin tf out."

Rivian R1T Towing Report
&#x200B;

[On Top of Monarch Pass](https://preview.redd.it/ve0z93h0wr9b1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=54f4bed2075a4abe2cfc8307122424bab8bddcd0)

Yesterday, I towed a small trailer through the mountains of Colorado.

Before making this trip, I tried to find some details on how well a Rivian R1T could tow a small trailer. For the most part, all I could find was some accounts of the Rivian towing extremely large RVs or 11,000 pound loads. While this was interesting, it didn’t give me much insight on what to expect towing a more reasonably sized trailer. So, I decided to put this report together for you all.

Here are some stats:

* Starting SoC: 100%
* Starting elevation: 7,703’
* Ending elevation: 5,906’
* Elevation before final descent: 8,277’
* Efficiency before final descent: 1.94 mi/kWh
* Trip efficiency: 2.14 mi/kWh
* Total miles: 184.2 miles
* Maximum estimated range towing this trailer: 262 - 289 miles
* R1T build: R1T Adventure Package, Quad Motor, Large Battery
* Software Version: 2023.22.0

Observations:

**Towing Range Estimate Wildly Inaccurate**

The towing range estimate algorithm is totally bonkers! At times, the prediction on the screen was well over 400 miles and it increased as I drove. I used a manual calculation formula based off of the trip meter that was far better:

(135 kWh - Used kWh) \* Efficiency

This gives an estimate of how far the remaining kWh will get you based off of the efficiency obtained during the trip so far.

&#x200B;

[449 Miles of Range Left! \(Fake News\)](https://preview.redd.it/ka8b90l3wr9b1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e8c68682c720679876982bbfb8971eaf0c61bbf8)

**Towing Regen is Amazing**

I gained about 4% of total battery capacity back while descending Monarch Pass. I expected to have to use the brakes some while descending all of the mountains throughout this trip, but I don’t think I really used the brakes at all. The regen did all the work of slowing the vehicle down every hill and didn’t really apply much limiting like it does during normal driving. You could just watch the SoC increase going down all of these hills and mountains.

**Be Prepared for Non-Working Chargers**

In retrospect, it was not necessary to charge at all during this trip. However, I attempted to engage in some provisional charging in Fairplay, CO. When I arrived, the Chargepoint tech was at the charger and said he was about to do some work on the system. I attempted to charge and the Chargepoint charger immediately overheated and shut off. The tech said that the heat exchanger was malfunctioning. There were no other fast chargers in this town and the next closest one was over 50 miles away. Luckily, we had enough capacity to make it to where we were going, but I can imagine a scenario in which this is not the case. It is still early days for EV charging infrastructure. You probably won’t find many gas stations that are out of gas with no other options for over 50 miles, but with EVs today, you can find yourself in this scenario.

**Crosswinds & Headwinds Impact Efficiency**

At one point, I encountered a strong crosswind for a stretch and saw the efficiency drop significantly. I know that this is the case for gas vehicles as well, and I can imagine a scenario towing through the midwest where things get very difficult for hundreds of miles. Thankfully, in the mountains, you have trees that mostly block these strong winds.

**Conclusion - The R1T is a Capable Towing Machine**

The truck performed far better than I could have imagined. Yes, if you are going to try to two a massive fifth wheeler that weighs, 11,000 lbs, you’re not going to get very much range. But if you’re towing something a bit more reasonable, the R1T will give you very reasonable performance that meets or exceeds gas vehicles in many cases.

Weekly Rivian Responds + Roundup: Details on NACS, Spare Tires, Driver+, and More! [6/27/2023]
Hey hey Rivimaniacs,

Can you believe that we've been doing roundups for almost two years now? Man, time flies (after your truck has been delivered). Alright, I'm back from Los Angeles - mostly to see my friends, but conveniently also to head to Venice to hear Rivian's Head of Design give a talk. [Did you read the summary](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/14j0u2k/event_summary_head_of_design_talk_at_venice_hub/)? It's chock full of interesting information. Also, thanks for understanding the time it takes to get these updates to you! We always try to have one important stickied post a week, even if we don't have a Rivian Responds. 

But today we do! So let's jump into it.

#  Subreddit Updates

* As you know because you check this subreddit every day, all day, we went dark to show support of 3rd party developers affected by Reddit's API changes. We also did it to send a message about how Reddit treats its community and communicates changes. We don't plan to do anything else in protest, but we're happy to have played our part in sending a message.
* We're going to start removing ""charger drama"" posts as low quality content. These are posts where someone posts a photo of a Rivian not charging or of a non-Rivian EV sitting at a RAN. 
* Curious about our engagement metrics? We're happy to share them with you! Over the past 30 days, we've seen...
   * 2.4M views *(+268k  from prior 30 days)*
   * 14.3k unique visitors on averages *(+1.5k from prior 30 days)*
   * 2k new subscribers *(+424 from prior 30 days)*
   * 1.1k posts published (50 posts reported)
   * 21.6k comments (45 comments reported)
   * The primary reasons for reports are 1) low quality content and 2) posts are not Rivian related. We continue to not have much of an issue with toxicity thankfully.

#  Weekly Rivian Responds

*To get your questions answered, comment below within 48hrs of this post going up.*

*Please remember that Rivian is a publicly traded company, so you may not get the detail you want about upcoming product, feature, or software timelines. Of course always ask what's most important, but for more detailed answers, try to ask questions about vehicle capability, choices already made (eg, design), or about the company in general.*

*  **Will it ever be possible to switch CCS trucks to NACS? Or will the adapter be the only option**
   * At this time, we don't plan to offer retrofits of CCS charge ports to NACS charge ports in existing Rivian vehicles as this hardware change won’t be necessary to use NACS chargers. We’ll make an NACS adapter available for R1T and R1S as early as spring 2024.
* **Will all future trucks be CCS and use an adapter? Or will Rivian switch to NACS after Spring 2024?**
   *  R1T and R1S will be built with NACS charge ports in 2025. Those vehicles will be able to use an adapter to leverage CCS charging sites. Whether your vehicle is built with a CCS charge port or NACS charge port, adapters will be available so that you have access to Rivian Adventure Network, Tesla Superchargers and third-party CCS networks.
* **We still don’t have any pricing info on RAN or the membership cost for things like cellular data. Is there an update here?**
   * We’ll introduce pricing at Rivian Adventure Network charging sites in the coming months. In-vehicle connectivity (hotspot) will be complimentary through the end of this year, and we’ll share more details including pricing closer to then.
* **Why was the driver monitoring camera deactivated during Driver+?**
   *  We made this change because the existing camera position and viewing angle didn’t meet our performance requirements. Rivian has been able to achieve current Driver+ functionality using other cameras, sensors and software embedded throughout the R1T and R1S. It’s also important to note that Driver+ remains standard in every Rivian and the deactivation and removal of this interior camera does not impact the safety or functionality of our vehicles, nor our ability to continue to improve Driver+ over time.  
* **There have been a lot of instances where Rivian owners have come back to their vehicles and found that they’ve been hit and Gear Guard has recorded nothing. Are there plans to improve Gear Guard to detect more than just visual motion?**
   *  Gear Guard uses computer vision techniques to detect people while the R1T or R1S is in its “sleep” state. There are two parameters the vehicle balances here: 1) making sure the vehicle optimizes efficiency by not being “awake” at all times and 2) keeping the number of recorded events manageable to owners by not triggering cameras every time there’s a moving object near the vehicle. 
   * For reference, Rivian vehicles do have the capability to detect any type of motion event (caused by people, other vehicles, etc.) when the vehicle is moving or awake. So the challenge you’re referencing is specifically capturing events caused by non-humans while the vehicle is in a sleep state. There are a lot of technical trade-offs to consider here, but we’ll continue to explore the feasibility of this based on owner feedback.
* **When will we have spare tires available for purchase?**
   * In Gear Shop, spare tires are listed as coming this summer. Our current estimate for when they’ll be purchasable is August.
* **Are there any updates for when the powered tonneau will be configurable again?**
   * We plan on reintroducing the powered tonneau cover to configurator in the future but can’t provide a more specific timeline quite yet.
* **Is there a reason for being unable to switch ride heights and modes while driving in Driver+?**
   * Great question! It’s important to remember that drive modes and suspension heights change the driving characteristics and performance of your Rivian. With Driver+ engaged, the vehicle is already consuming and reacting to cascades of data in real time. Considering all the variables being processed (like vehicle speed and position, road curvature, and the position of other motorists), limiting the additional variables that the driver can introduce helps optimize for vehicle performance and safety.
   * An example of this is limiting the speed of Rivian vehicles when at max suspension height. We know that raising the vehicle to its full ground clearance means a higher center of gravity and reduced aerodynamic performance – so limiting access to this suspension setting when at highway speeds helps maintain the vehicle’s performance and efficiency.

Tough feedback - customer support issues
Ok where do I start how about. 

TLDR: rivian support ignores me and won’t refund a package they have lost for accessories they have sent and mislabelled with the wrong client. So I can’t pickup the package with my iD! Then they won’t ship a new package and they won’t refund me because I use a freight forwarder to get the package to Canads as rivian won’t ship their items off the store directly to Canadians - further frustration and extra costs. This has been a 2 month battle 
- so I’m on Reddit now. 

What would y’all do in this case?

Guide says he doesn’t deal with that support item. 

Support requests ignore me completely and never get back on the phone. 

Support on the app opens and does respond and say they’ll have someone from product and support reach out. Then no one reaches out. 

It’s been on 10 calls and 5 emails and countless wasted time. Probably more but who’s keeping count. 

Soooo I’m trying to remain patient but this has to have a happy ending no?

Anyone else dealing with this?

Cheers love the truck. Just some fine tuning for them to take care of here."

Weekly Rivian Responds + Roundup: Cell Tethering, Text Messaging, Actual Batter Capacity, and Tonneaus! [5/17/2023]
Hey Rivianonites, 

Happy Wednesday everyone! Did you know that it's almost June? That's sorta halfway through the year which is pretty neat! I've been reflecting on the early days of this sub when it looked like the Cybertruck and R1T were going to be coming out at around the same time. Do y'all remember the arguments about which one would be first? Which one was vaporware? Anyways, that was a silly time...

* I spend a lot of time in a remote ""adventure"" area where AT&T doesn't have signal but T-Mobile does. I tether my phone to my truck so I can get music, set up navigation etc, but it disconnects when I exit park. Is allowing tethering while driving on the roadmap?
   * Wifi tethering to a cellular device while driving is not currently on our development roadmap.
* Are there any updates coming to allow us to access text messages through the voice assistant (Alexa or integration with Google Assistant / Siri)?
   * We’re currently exploring this functionality in the R1T and R1S.
* What is the actual capacity of the max battery pack?
   * When asked what the kWh capacity of our batteries are, we offer the range capacity instead. We frame it this way because our vehicles' efficiency is driven by many factors across energy storage, drive unit efficiency, aerodynamics, and more. Zooming in on a single part of that system doesn’t tell the full story, and we want to make sure we center on what matters most to our customers when selecting a battery pack- usable range for driving.
      * For R1T, the range of a Max pack battery paired with Dual-Motor AWD is an estimated 400 miles.
      * For R1S, the range of a Max pack battery paired with Dual-Motor AWD is an estimated 390 miles.
   * It’s also worth noting that we improve vehicle software through over-the-air updates, meaning we can continue to optimize vehicle efficiency and range over time.
* Is there a process and/or contact for app developers looking to integrate a music/podcast app into Rivian's system?
   * Not yet, but we want to build a process for this in the future.
* We noticed some powered tonneau trucks in the shop. Does this mean that powered tonneaus are coming back? Or is this a previously manufactured truck?
   * The few trucks you may have seen in R1 Shop with powered tonneau covers recently were model year 2022 R1T.
* Any updates on powered tonneau repairs?
   * You may have seen [RJ’s social posts](https://www.instagram.com/p/CsHANJGqPRc/) last week where he shared that upgraded powered tonneau components would begin shipping to Service Centers this summer. Once that inventory starts to arrive, we’ll open the ability for existing owners to schedule service appointments.

Driver +
After using Driver + in a road-trip to Pinecrest lake, I would like to share some thoughts.

I have a Honda CR-V, and that’s my main point of reference. In this post I’m comparing Honda ACC and LKAS features to Rivian Driver + features.

## Honda ACC and LKAS

The Adaptive Cruise Control can be enabled anywhere after reaching a speed of 40 mph. It’s very similar to Rivian’s Highway Assist. It will keep you in your lane at some specified speed or distance from the car in front of you.

The Lane Keeping Assist System is very similar to Lane Keep Assist. You have to enable it each time you turn on the car from the wheel.

## Highway Assist (HA henceforward)

(+) It’s very easy to get HA started, and it’s clear when you can get it started.
(+) For the most part where I could enable HA, I had a great and seamless experience.
(-) In the CRV you can start ACC anywhere. I understand the risk where people may turn it on somewhere with stops, but the locations where you can start HA feel limited.
(+) HA stays engaged in places where Hondas ACC would hand the control back to the driver.
(-) I can’t hear any alerts when driving 80+ mph. I notice the music volume goes down but the road noice completely shadows all the alerts.
(-) Making small corrections with the wheel turns off partially HA, specifically the lane keeping feature. That feels wrong, I need to make corrections when big trucks get to close to the car, or start getting into my lane. The CRV will only turn it off if you get out of your lane. I would suggest something similar.
(-) I’m glad I had my hands at the wheel all times! There was a small section where the lanes where not clear (old lines where painted too) and the Rivian started an aggressive turn where no turn was needed. I was able to get the car back to the lane but at 80 mph it felt very scary and bouncy. If the lane confidence is low, just hand the wheel back to the driver.

## Lane Keep Assist (LKA henceforward)

(+) You can enable early feedback. I have configured early warnings.
(+) I don’t have to enable it each time I turn on the car!
(+) It’s always visible and clear when a lane is detected.
(-) A lane is not detected if you are next to a curb or barricades.
(-) Warnings and assist are usually wrong in lane merges.
(-) In the CRV, LKAS keeps the car then the middle of the lane, and my wife loves that in curves. Rivian’s LKA won’t keep you in the middle of the lane, the feedback won’t make any meaningful corrections in curves when driving 40+ mph. 

## Conclusion 

The CRV has fewer sensors but it delivers an amazing experience, there are a few things that Rivian is already doing better, but there’s room for improvement.

I live my R1S and I have had a good experience 90% of the time. I can’t wait for the OTAs with improvements and new features!

Thank you for reading."

R1S thoughts after 3 weeks
Some feedback on software if u/WassymRivian is reading and some non-software feedback FWIW. Oct 2020 reservation. Took delivery of an R1S on 3/31. The R1S replaced a 2018 Volkswagen Atlas. Overall, I'm very happy with it, but one thing drives me crazy:

1. Hypersensitive driver occupancy sensor shifts into park too quickly. At a car wash, for example, I leaned my head out the window so I could see whether my tire was lining up w/ the conveyor’s front wheel pull, and the car shifted into park immediately. I couldn’t both look at my wheel \*and\* drive forward at the same time. Eventually I gave up, drove forward blindly & hoped for the best. That sucked. Same issue every time I back up. When backing, I sometimes lift out of the seat so I can get a better view out the back, get a different angle in my side-view mirrors to better see a curb, etc. Every time, I get shifted into park instantly. I’d love to be able to backup or look out a window without getting shifted into park. This can’t be a regulatory requirement b/c my Model 3 doesn't do this. Any fix here would be a huge improvement.

…two things I wish had been designed differently:

2. No bottleholders in the doors. A 2018 Atlas had these, 2023 Tesla M3 has these, 2017 Chevy Volt had these, 2010 VW Sportwagen had these, etc. It’s table stakes in \*any\* car to have a place for each passenger to have a coffee/cup and water bottle, but the absence of bottleholders is especially conspicuous in the R1S given all the adventure marketing. I can \*force\* a bottle into the door pockets, but that's not a great solution. Maybe the aftermarket will solve this with plastic inserts that hold open the hinged fabric door pockets with space to slide a water bottle in/out easily. Or with something mounted in the floor space in front of center console (won’t help in the back row). But really…much cheaper cars have gotten bottleholders-in-doors right for over a decade.

3. Phone holder / charging pad is (1) difficult to position correctly; (2) doesn’t stay in the position while driving; (3) in direct sunlight where it will overheat; (4) positioned so you can’t read the screen. In contrast, a 2023 Model 3 has a felt-lined tray with space for two phones, positions each over its respective charger with zero-fuss, holds them at an angle at which you can see the phone screen while driving, and doesn’t have them sitting in direct sunlight. For now, a USB-C charging cable solves my charging issue, but still leaves the phone sitting in direct sunlight & hard to read. A center console that’s bigger (move the speaker to the back?) and has a better phone holder/charger would be a big improvement. The current setup feels like it was designed for a truck w/ a front bench seat option where they had to preserve center-seat foot space, but it makes no sense for separate bucket seats.

…a handful of other things I’m hoping software updates will bring:

4. Scheduled departure. Tesla has this. Set a time when you plan to depart & the car preconditions the battery & cabin so that everything is warm & ready to go at that time. Especially nice that windshield/windows are defrosted.

5. Navigation “Use HOV” option. Minor issue, but nav would route me to right-side exits when I was using left-side HOV exits.

6. Pause BT/Spotify when Navigation talks. Navigation talks over audio; less of an issue for music, but more of an issue for podcasts.

7. Less visually ambiguous UI switches/buttons. Black = on; White = off reminds me of iOS 7 when everything went flat. Less visually ambiguous status indicators would be an improvement.

8. Default vent positions. My kids dragged these all over the place. Would love a button that returns them all to a default position.

…and this probably won’t happen, but I would love:

9. A setting for ***non***\-adaptive cruise-control. I don’t like ACC generally, but Rivian’s implementation is the first time I’ve had ACC slow down in a curve just because it was a curve (i.e., despite no traffic ahead). Also, ACC requires Driver+, which wasn’t available one drive after the car had been sitting in a hot Palm Springs parking lot (it came back fine next time I started the car). So I didn’t have ACC for that entire drive, whereas non-adaptive cruise control would’ve worked even when Driver+ wasn’t available.

Overall, it's great and frequent software updates keep making it better. Huge kudos to Rivian. Hang in there, reservation holders, you won’t be disappointed."

Configuration won’t let you select dual motor option
We just bit the bullet and put a deposit down for an R1T. While trying to start the configuration, it won’t let us select dual motor. Is there any reason why? If we select quad motor, can we switch it to dual later? We want to lock in our pricing ASAP. TIA"

March Coastal Beach Drive - Grayland, WA
[Emerald City Rivian Club](https://www.emeraldcityrivianclub.com) is meeting this Sunday, March 5, 2023 at 11:30 AM for a beach drive! 

Bonge Road Beach Access
400 West Bonge Avenue Westport, WA 98595

In contrast to visiting the mountains to ski two weeks earlier, this meetup will be driving the beaches of our western Washington shores. 

We will meet at 11:30 am for a sandy drive on Grayland Beach, and maybe a sand recovery demo. The beach is about 7.5 miles long from the entrance to exit and won’t take more than 20 minutes to drive without stopping. That being said, we will stop along the way to have a little fun and drive back and forth so this doesn’t have to be a one-way beach drive.

After driving the beach, we will break off for lunch around 1:00 (flexible). We have a few different lunch options below and folks can mix and match to fit their taste buds and plans. We will likely split into smaller groups depending on restaurant choice so that way we don’t overload one restaurant at once.

After lunch, you’re free to continue to hang out on the coast or head back home. If you’d like to stay on the coast, we can either head south for a loop through Grayland beach through Raymond back up to Aberdeen (58 miles), or take a detour north to Ocean Shores to drive another beach (70 miles). This will be played by ear and people can split off to fit what most interests them.

Directions and Information:

We will meet on the sand at the Bonge Ave beach access point, just south of Twin Harbors State Park. 
Directions from Tacoma/Seattle (2-2.5 hours) - drive the 5 to Olympia before heading west. This is a faster and cheaper option than taking a ferry over to the peninsula. 
Directions from Everett or further north (2.5-3 hours + charging time) - drive the 5 south, but plan on charging in Olympia or Lacey for a quick top off before heading to the coast.  
Directions from Port Angeles (3.5 hours) - head east down the 101 instead of west down the coast. This will save you 25 minutes and 20 miles of driving. 
Directions from Portland - you have two options:
1) Take the 5 north to Grand Mound (just north of Great Wolf Lodge) then head west
2) Take the 26 west from Portland until you hit the coast, where you will then head north. I'd highly recommend stopping for a charge in Astoria on your way up so you can avoid Aberdeen where many other Rivian's will be charging.

There is a public restroom near the entrance but there is a chance it could be closed depending if the state closes it. Other restroom options are at any fast food or store in Aberdeen, 20 miles (25 minutes) northeast, or limited options in Westport, 4 miles (8 minutes) north. I’d recommend stopping for a restroom break before meeting with the group at 11:30 as the beach has a few unknown-condition options.

Recreational fires are allowed on the beach if you want some warmth and are planning on staying for a few hours. Be sure to follow all state laws regarding beach fires.

Cost:
Beach access = free
Charging = free if using the Aberdeen RAN (Rivian Adventure Network) station, or at a cost if using the EA station
Food = this will depend whether you BYO or if you stop for lunch
Food:

There are a few restaurants in Westport to pick from including the following:
Aloha Alabama BBQ
Bennett’s Fish Shack
Blackbeard’s Brewing Company
Westport Pizza Company

There are more restaurants than the ones listed above, but feel free to BYO lunch as well if you’d like to each on the beach or in one of the parks. 

If you want to head back to the city after the beach, there are also plenty of fast food options in Aberdeen to eat at while you charge - the RAN station however has practically no food options so if you choose this route, I’d recommend charging at the EA station instead where there are many options.
Charging:

Please charge to 100% before leaving your home. Roundtrip from downtown Seattle is about 280 miles with no detours, so even by charging to 100%, a charging stop will be required. By charging to 100% at the start, you will help reduce wait times at the charging stations as there will be many Rivian’s trying to charge around the same time. If you’re willing to arrive in Aberdeen early, charge before the meetup to reduce wait times after the event.

Expect to be flexible on when you charge - before or after the meetup. If many people arrive early expecting to charge, it could cause a delay on the meetup time, so be flexible and open to station availability.

It will be cold overnight, but camping is a great option if you want to make a weekend out of the trip. There are many camp sites along the coast such as Pacific Beach and Ocean City both of which have some RV sites where you can charge overnight. 
Most RV sites use either a 50 amp (14-50 adapter included from Rivian) or 30 amp (TT-30 adapter available here) but call the site to double check. 
A 30 amp outlet gives you about ~5 miles of range per hour (set the Rivian charge limit to 24 amps on the Energy page on the infotainment screen)
A 50 amp outlet gives you about ~15 miles of range per hour (set the Rivian charge limit to 40 amps on the Energy page on the infotainment screen)

If you don’t want to camp, there are many accommodations along the coast including Seabrook, Ocean City, and Westport. A good example is LOGE Westport which has both a hotel and RV sites but is currently under construction.

Tire Requirements:
The 20” tires are always best for any off-pavement activity, but the other tires should do fine. Luckily if you get stuck, there are many Rivian’s equipped with recovery gear to help.

Beach driving laws:
Washington beaches are subject to highway rules with a speed limit of 25 mph. No fishtailing, circling, figure eights, racing, or driving in the surf are allowed. 
You must operate your vehicle in such a manner that is safe and non-threatening to operators, passengers, pedestrians, equestrians, animals, vehicles, or anything else on the beach. There are penalties listed under WAC 352-37-330 for any driving laws violated.

Feel free to make a weekend out of it and stay on the coast before meeting at 11:30 am Sunday. There are many great accommodations along the coast with 50 kw charging options. Check PlugShare to see available chargers. Be sure to call ahead to confirm availability."

(Seattle) February Ski Meetup
Join Emerald City Rivian Club for our February gathering this **Sunday the 12th** at 7:30 am for a day on the slopes. Yes, it's Super Bowl Sunday, but this is a great way to spend your morning doing something active before the game starts at 3:30 PM. 

[https://www.emeraldcityrivianclub.com/events/february-ski-2023](https://www.emeraldcityrivianclub.com/events/february-ski-2023)

&#x200B;

We will meet at 7:30 am for BYO breakfast and coffee at [this parking lot](https://goo.gl/maps/kmZkRc1edhA92Ge46) by [West Summit at Snoqualmie](https://summitatsnoqualmie.com/). It’s *very important* that you arrive between 7:15 and 7:30 in order to get a parking space near the group. We do not have reserved parking so if you arrive later, it’s unlikely you will get a parking space with the group and will need to find parking elsewhere. 

\*note on the parking lot: go just past the main lodge and turn right. Head up the small hill towards the Little Thunder lift. I will be there between 7:00-7:15 am so if you don’t see a Glacier White R1T, you’re in the wrong spot --- be sure to click the parking lot link above for the exact spot. 

After breakfast, we will split off to ski/snowboard and won’t formally meet up again, but feel free to bring food for lunch if you want to skip the busy lodge and meet back up with other members for a mid-day bite. 

**The Summit at Snoqualmie info:**

* We will meet at the Summit West location. It has something for all skill levels with magic carpet, green, blue, and black runs. Free shuttles are available if you’d like to meet for breakfast but visit the more challenging Central, East, and Alpental slopes without moving your vehicle. 
* Daily lift tickets are available [here](https://shop.summitatsnoqualmie.com/s/lift-ticket/lift-tickets/p/open-close?60=2023-02-12&61=129). **Lift tickets can sell out so please buy in advance if you don’t already have a season pass.** 
* Ski/snowboard rentals are available directly through [The Summit](https://shop.summitatsnoqualmie.com/s/zrentals/p/skisnowboard-rentals) \- ***advanced online reservations are required*** so be sure to book this with your lift ticket. You will not be able to make a rental reservation day-of. 

**Cost:**

* Parking = free
* Lift tickets = Adult pricing starts as low as **$108**, with Youth, Child and Senior available at a lower cost.
* Ski/snowboard rentals = Adult pricing starts at **$59**, with Youth and Child available at a lower cost.
* Food/drinks = BYO

**Food:**

* BYO breakfast and drinks! 
* Our vehicles are equipped with a 120v household outlet so bring any equipment you need to make breakfast. Be sure to bring trash bags and cleaning products. 
* Breakfast ideas:
   * Burritos pre-made and reheated in a microwave or on a panini press
   * Eggs, bacon and French toast made on a griddle
   * Breakfast bake made in a crockpot
   * Coffee brewed in a Keurig/Nespresso, or instant coffee/tea using a kettle
* Lunch ideas:
   * Instant ramen cups using hot water from a kettle
   * Veggies and protein, quesadillas or hot sandwiches using a griddle or panini press
   * Crockpot soup

**Charging:**

* If you are coming from Seattle, please charge to 85% in order to make it back to the city without charging. Heading up the pass will use more range than coming back down. EA fast chargers are in North Bend and Issaquah if you need a top off on the way back down.
* No charging is available at The Summit West.

**Tire Requirements:**

* The roads are pretty well maintained. All tires are welcome but drive with extra caution in slippery conditions.

See you on the slopes! Join the discussion on our [Discord channel](https://discord.gg/KjvPA7PF)!"

Loving our R1T BUT….. it’s missing some basic feature and software things. Let’s talk about it. Time for suggestions
Loving our R1T. But really missing the Tesla App experience. I’m still trying to wrap my head around some of the basic things missing in the app or how “clunky” the Rivian app can be. I know I know, they need time….. I get it. But in today’s market you have to do the basics sooner. 

Also some features that I just thought they would have by now within the truck/software. Bear with me, it’s going to be a long one 😂😂. 

The biggest things the app needs sooner rather than later are: 

1. Notifications for charging status ( charging started, interrupted/stopped, completed/finished) these are basic and essential. It’s happened to me 3-4 times already where I’m at a public level 2 charger, and the charger faulted or stopped or something happened and I check back a few hours later in the rivian app, and it’s not charging or added 5miles or something. The charging faulting out isn’t Rivian’s fault obviously, but the truck/software/app not notifying me that charging was interrupted or stopped is a rivian issue. 

2. Schedule departure. I swear this might be my most missed feature from my tesla and tesla app.  It’s just simple, easy, and works out better for the truck and me ESPECIALLY in the winter. Apparently Rivian is working on this, but from the people I’ve heard from they have been working on this for a while. Im not sure 100%. Hopefully someone from rivian can fully confirm this. As I’m sure most of you know, this will help with battery preconditioning and driving efficiency, which leads to reduced charging time and cost, especially for winter driving. I know ppl feel it’s not always necessary to precondition the battery. But as someone who has been driving EVs for a long time, it makes a difference for those of us who have winters or cold morning starts. Having the battery fully warmed allows for full regen braking. This leads to a more consistent performance and experience. Having the cabin fully warmed or cooled means the hvac has to do less work which mean the vehicle is more efficient, which leads to more range on arrival and less charging or reduce charging times and cost. Lastly, you just set it and forget it. 

3. Reducing the amount of clicks to do things within the app.  Example, it’s 3-4 clicks to see the location of the truck. That’s way too many. It should just be 1-2 at most.  Or just show me the current location under the location tab. Then if I click it, show me on map within the app. Another one, the ”control tabs”: why not just make the items in the control tabs on the main page? Simpler, fast and easy.  Possibly just a better overall design of the app. They have updated it well and brought more features, but they just need to sit and make it more streamlined. Give more information with less clicks.  Another example, on the top left side you have two lines that when pressed shows you yet again your car and range and miles and at the bottom add gear.  This can be consolidated.  The bottom of the app has a icon of the truck which is automatically selected since it’s the main page. A lightening bolt for chargers and a profile button. The truck icon just needs to be removed, the lighting bolt can stay but needs to be used for everything related to charging, whether that be current charging session or looking for a charger.  On the main page while charging they could shrink the picture of the truck down where it shows charging at the top move it to left and show the current kw speed and est time left. For more info you can see a full charging summary like you do now BUT by clicking the lightening bolt. See how that integrates better.  The profile should be moved to the menu (two line) under that tap. Then they can rearrange the main page to show you more with less clicks. 

Also I think we should have more control over things within the app. Like being able to turn on power outlets from the app. Or possibly adjust ride height in some situations.  

4. More things saved to the driver profile. Yes, I know the air vent for the most part saves to the driver profile. However, it’s super annoying that every morning when I run the heat, I have to turn off the vents on the windshield/defrost and turn on the vents under the screen.  They always close/turn off when the heat comes on. This should be saved to the driver profile and remain that way. If I leave the seat heater on and exit the vehicle, yes, it should turn off when I leave the truck (duh that makes sense) but when I return it should turn back on like I left. Or, add an auto setting so it warms the seat or cools seat depending on outside temp just like the hvac does.  But please also add cool seats to surfaces for the summer months. Next, allow for more than one Alexa account.  Another one, maybe this is just my truck, for some odd reason, if I switch profiles to my spouse’s while I’m driving, I CANNOT switch back to mine while I’m driving. I can switch it, but the seats, mirrors, etc do not change.  Please add multiple Spotify accounts per driver profile.  Also can the accent lighting have a option to be synced to the automatic headlights? Yes they don’t take up a lot of power but they don’t need to be on during the day time.  However they can be turn on like they do now if a person wants. 

5. Better integration of charging networks. I know this one is a tough one as that requires work from rivian and the charging networks. This might be a dream that can’t happen. Of course the RAN will be incorporated well. Also, I don’t understand why if I’m navigating somewhere and I don’t need to charge or, even if I do, I cannot click on another charger and see it’s detail while navigating to a destination. This is stupid in my opinion. While on topic of navigation, how is this updated? Is this sent via OTA BY RIVIAN?  I hope they can somewhat just switch to google maps. This mapbox thing is not great at all. Weirdly, if I type in an address sometimes it won’t work or won’t show up. But if I ask Alexa to navigate to the same address, the in car nav can then pull the address up. It’s weird. Google maps is just a better option. Hopefully it can be switched to soon. 

6. Better Bluetooth control and  proximity control with the app. This is one thing tesla has really, really gotten down. However, they have been doing it the longest so it makes sense. NOTE: PAAK has always worked for me in my truck. It’s almost as good as my model s plaid. My issue is my truck rarely sleeps when at home. YES gear guard is set to off when home, I have turned off proximity when at home, and my truck still rarely will deep sleep at home. I have moved my key fob to our office, which is in the front of the house; my phone is charged right outside of our master bedroom but our garage is behind our master. So for me, the only way to get it/force it to sleep I have to close the Rivian app, turn off Bluetooth as well. But as you know the iPhone turns off the Bluetooth until next day, so at 12am it turns back on. But this cause issues because then my watch or AirPod can’t be used. It’s quite annoying. 

7. This is a truck thing and software, pulling power from our wall charger vs the truck battery for heating/cooling listening to music etc.  My truck will finish charging around 2-5am depending on the charge level, when I get home from work the night before. The truck starts charging at midnight and has a cutoff of 5:30am. I leave for work at 5:30am, so I do this to help have the battery warm before heading out. But once I get up @ 4:55am the truck is normally already done charging, I turn on the climate and seat heaters and steering wheel, the truck will NOT pull the power from the wall but will pull it out of the HVBP, which makes zero sense when it’s connected to the charger. Now I know you might not be able to directly say hey pull from the wall. But when the truck is connected to a charger, pull it from the charger. The battery in these trucks are huge and can take a lot time to charge. So anything that can preserve the trucks battery for driving or when disconnected from a charger should be done. I think this one should be “easier” to add. 

I’m not sure if this is accurate just yet, but my truck also doesn’t sleep when it’s connected to a charger. Obviously it can’t be sleeping while charging, but this could be a result of what I stated above, about the Bluetooth and proximity. But if I get home at 6pm the truck will stay up the entire time until it starts to charge. And same if it finishes, it stays awake. My tesla NEVER did this. Hell, my tesla would almost go to sleep too quick lol. My model s plaid doesn’t have this behavior at all.  

8.  Live gear guard video, and dashcam.  

Yes, I know live video with sentry mode on Teslas is relatively new. It’s about a year old. But I do think this is something that is very, very valuable. I understand this one will take a lot time to incorporate. Plus workout the internet part of that, And making sure it’s securely done as well. Hopefully it’s at least on the docket. Dashcam should just be a thing in most vehicles period! I do know rivian is working on dashcam. But I just figured it would be there from the beginning. I mean think about it, people adventure with this awesome truck, it would be very, very cool to be able to track that, with video footage of rock crawling, or in very remote places. Or trails you conquered. Kinda like how tesla track mode can record your laps and lap times etc! I think rivian could call it adventure cam for when you want to off road etc, and dashcam for regular driving. Kinda like, I didn’t get it how snow mode wasn’t a thing until just now on a adventure vehicle. But better late than never and much appreciated. Works very very well. And it came right in time for our snow storm. Once again this truck is awesome. 

9.  This isn’t major, but showing more info about the vehicle while it’s in motion. When I say this, show it’s currently speed, approximately where it’s heading or direction, tire pressure, etc. I think that would be nice instead of just in use. You could keep the design just add more details around the truck. 

10. Letting the service portion of the app allow for texting and communicating directly with the rivian service center. This is a great way to have a “paper trail” of conversations. I’m having this issue now as my truck has to have a lot of things serviced. However, after the service center reached back out to me after 3 weeks, supposedly they know what is happening and when my appointment will be and how my truck will get there. But that’s another discussion. 

I think this company will go far and make so many people happy.  I know we are. But I just want them to focus on the basics:  bring the app up to speed, and make the software match the amazing capabilities that this truck has. 

I know will rivian will keep the OTA comings and as the fleet gets bigger and stronger more things will change and evolve. 

This was long; it’s kinda funny how long it is. Half the people won’t read it. TLTR comments are queuing up. Hahah. But maybe some people feel the same. Let’s talk about it down below. Let’s get rivian more items that we as owners feel should have more focus on them currently.  🤗 keep adventuring."

Bouncing
I’m waiting for a plan from service for ongoing bouncing/wallowing in my R1T. There was a little of it when I first got the truck, but it now feels like riding in the back of my parents old station wagon in the 70s. I remember a post from someone describing something similar (like a “lowrider”) and saying it was the air suspension which got fixed? 

Looking for anyone else’s experience so I can try to accelerate things with support - my spouse won’t ride in the truck anymore and I’m starting dread longer drives :-("

Complete Rivian Experience With Feedback
Order Date: Nov 2021

Delivery Date: May 2022

Location: Boulder CO

Spec: R1T, large pack, black interior, 20’ wheels, Forrest Green

Delivery: Assigned guide and next day had a VIN in Denver. Previous owner must have bailed or my theory that they just made a bunch of configurations and sent them to popular service locations.

Cost: Received $45,500 for my 2019 long range Model 3, $10,000 in federal and state incentives, Taxes + registration \~$6,000, MRSP $77,000

Overall Evaluation: Absolutely love the truck. It can do it all and even though it has been far from perfect, I would do it all over again.

Background: Owned a long range AWD Model 3 for three years and loved the car but wanted something that would handle the Colorado mountains better. I, like many others, am a bit of an EV enthusiast and work in robotics so I understand a bit of the technical aspects.

Issues and Feedback:

Phantom drain:

One of the biggest issues and one I hope is fixed soon. I left the truck in an underground garage from Sunday to to Thursday with outside temperatures for the week being 40-75 deg. The truck went from 36% to 7% in that time and actually had to have someone plug it in for me because I was worried I wouldn’t be able to open the charge port when I got back Friday. Gear guard was turned off and no outlets were on. I submitted a ticket and a service appointment was made to collect more data but when the guide came to the appointment for other reasons he said it is a known issue and believes it is being worked on. Since then the car has sat in 95 deg weather outside and seen less drain so I am not sure what was happening.

Gained knowledge: Use the shipping mode if absolutely needing to reduce drain. The charge port opens from the 12V and the 12 volt only charges while plugged in or driving, not while sitting even when the battery has a charge. The 12v can last longer or shorter than the large battery and if the 12v dies, the charge port can be opened manually but it is a process. There is no limit on the battery conditioning, it will continue conditioning until the battery is at zero. I would like to see that decrease as the battery gets below 10%.

Tonneau Cover:

Obviously a known issue how bad this thing is. Mine broke about a month in likely less than 15-20 uses. The mobile repair guy for installing the spare tire gave me some information on this. He said they have had a lot of issues and will likely be pushing the manual cover retrofit once it is released. Says he has seen service vehicles with it but no customers vehicles yet. My cover was only going in about two panels. The fix, spray window cleaner on the top along the sides of the cover to add lubrications. He also said pushing the panels down from the center as they go in can help. He continued to clean it and lubricate it a bit more. A couple hours later I tried opening it and it got stuck halfway. I tried pushing the panels down and in and that got it opened all the way.

TLDR: lubricate the top with window cleaner and push center of panels down and in to open a stuck tonneau cover.

Failed Software Update:

The last software update (One with dog mode) failed to install without knowing. The next morning the screen was turned off, did a screen reset and full reset and things appeared to be working again. Noticed some strange issues with the screen but the car drove fine so I continued with driving to the mountains to do a trail run. On the way up, vehicle shipping was flashing on and off along with the car going into car wash mode. Nothing noticeably dangerous so I continued into the mountains. After the run and in about 95 deg heat, I start driving home. I tried to turn the air conditioned seats on but they turned off and the seat warmers turned on to level 2. Pushed it to level 1 and all the combinations one could think of but the seat warmer would always go back to level 2. The back window defroster also couldn’t be turned off. Drove home with the windows down and very hot. When talking with Rivian later, they noticed the failed up and pushed it again which fixed the issues. Just a bit unfortunate circumstances.

Hood Deformation:

The hood alignment at the top and bottom are good but there is about a quarter inch offset 3/4 the way up on the driver side so the only gap seen from the driver seat is pretty bad. Rivian mobile repair said nothing could be done since it isn’t alignment.

Registration Late:

Three days before the temp plates expired I called my guide with concerns. They said everything was on track and had more temp plates to be sent soon. The temp plates would have arrived but UPS had to change the delivery so I went the weekend with expired plates. Received the real plates a week later.

Charging:

It is a big battery. I won’t be doing any big road trips until the adventure network comes to fruition or the super charger network is opened up.

Pedal Mapping:

A lot of dead range and takes a bit of a press before it starts moving which confuses everyone when they first start to drive it. When flooring it, there is a noticeable lag before electricity actually starts flowing to the motors which decreases the instant torque feeling electric cars are known for. I have heard others mention it is because of the weight but it seems to be the controls software in the car which makes me hopeful they may someday release different acceleration modes. It is a bit disappointing coming from a Tesla.

Unlocking the Car and Doors:

Phone key is really bad and mostly unused. I keep it on the phone though because I want to be able to manually unlock from the app. Wish these two things were decoupled. When working nearby, I have to disable bluetooth on the phone to not drive myself crazy. Even the key fob has issues and sometimes needs to be pressed a few times for it to be recognized. I would expect that to be instant but it isn’t. Often when trying to open the tailgate, frunk or cargo tunnel there is a delay or they won’t open until I unlock it a second time. Makes it difficult to easily get in and out of different areas. Also wish the air-conditioning wouldn’t come on every time it was unlocked.

MTB Tailgate Cover:

Bought a tailgate cover and ended up returning it. The gooseneck doesn’t bide will for these as the cover needs to slide over the pad. Instead bought a hitch rack instead which is a much better solution.

Charge Error Indicators:

Occasionally when getting in the car, the battery will read zero percent and gives a good scare the first time it happens. Will also get notifications for the truck having less than 50 mi on my phone when it has over 80 mi in some cases.

Camp Speaker:

Overall very cool but when trying to use it for a party the bass continued to stop working and the volume wouldn’t go very high. I confirmed it wasn’t on no bass mode and doing a reset would temporarily fix it. It seemed to stop working when bass heavy songs came on.

Air compressor:

Bought an attachment to make it easier to use on bikes but after it would do one compression, it would fail to fill up the bike tire. Sometimes it would continue to compress but I would need to continue to push the start button. After about 20 minutes of trying to get it to work, I instead used a broken hand pump. Probably user error but at the moment I view it as something only useful for the tires on the truck.

Camera access:

It would be great to have access to second backup cam behind the cab for when tailgate is down or hitch rack is on.

Proximity sensors with hitch bike rack:

When the hitch bike rack is on, backing up is annoying. Being able to turn off the proximity sensor when something is in the hitch would be ideal.

Conclusion:

Love the truck, there isn’t a better one on the market but there is still lot of room to improve."

Weekly Rivian Roundup: Known Issues Special Edition!
Hey everyone!

Apologies for the delay on the Weekly Roundups. Work has been pretty intense the past while for reasons. Thanks for bearing with me.

# Known Issues Special Edition!

With so many deliveries lately, me and the other mods had noticed that a lot of you were asking the same questions about your new trucks— and usually someone else had a solution! In this week's Weekly Rivian Roundup, we're doing things a little differently. Ten days ago, we asked you to list any issues you're having with your truck and the steps to fix it (if there were any). Y'all came through.

""But why?"" you may ask yourself. Well, we're a hobby community, and that means working together to help each other solve issues. We don't want to be a place where critiques or troubleshooting aren't encouraged, so hopefully this sets the right, productive / constructive tone.

The known issues the community has shared are listed below. Apologies for not being able to call out each user who shared one (Reddit makes this very hard to do). If you have another one to add, please leave a comment using the same format. Also, let us know in the comments if you have an update for your issue!

*Note: your friendly neighborhood mods haven't validated the accuracy of the claims below.*

**- - - - - - SQUEAKS**

**Issue:** Suspension squeaks

* **Description:** Most noticeable at lower speeds under 30mph, the front suspension squeaks. It sounds like a bird chirping, not like metal grinding against metal. This sound was not noticeable in the First Mile trucks.
* **Rivian Contacted?** Y
* **Resolvable?** N
* **Steps to Fix:** The issue is not resolvable at this time. Rivian knows about the issue, stating that it's an issue with the hydrologic fluid used in the suspension's actuators. They do not know how to fix it yet, though they said it may involve changing out the fluid. Rivian has asked people to raise a support ticket if they're experiencing the issue.

**- - - - - - SOFTWARE**

**Issue**: Front passenger unbuckled seatbelt indicator flashing/chiming

* **Description**: With no one in the front passenger seat, the vehicle still seems to think a passenger is present. The unbuckled seatbelt indicator intermittently flashes & chimes unless the corresponding belt is buckled OR if a small amount of weight is on the seat. This issue also prevents the vehicle from ""sleeping"" immediately after arriving at a destination.
* **Rivian Contacted?** Y
* **Resolvable?** Darn better be
* **Steps to Fix:** TBD

**Issue:** Feed from cameras turn green

* **Description:** A subset of the cameras, as shown on the surround view and main screen have a green tint. Wife sent a photo while she was out with the kids. [https://imgur.com/a/6QZu3wx](https://imgur.com/a/6QZu3wx)
* **Rivian Contacted?** No
* **Resolvable?** Yes
* **Steps to Fix:** Soft reset was able to resolve this. Haven't bothered Rivian with it, if it happens again or frequently, I'll submit a ticket.

**Issue:** Auto wipers don't engage when raining, wipe once when putting into Drive or Reverse

* **Description:** Auto wipers do not engage when it is raining. Have been in light and heavy rain on multiple occasions and the wipers will not engage on their own while in Auto mode. Have driven in rain for multiple minutes while raining until it was no longer safe to do so without manually engaging. Wipers also will sometimes do a single wipe when switching into gear for the first time after starting up the vehicle.
* **Rivian Contacted?** Y
* **Resolvable?** Y
* **Steps to Fix:** Likely a software issue but have not yet heard back from Rivian after putting in a ticket 1-2 weeks ago.

**Issue:** Garage door won't program

* **Description:** Garage door won't program: Follow the steps on the center screen but the programming times-out/fails.
* **Rivian Contacted?** Y
* **Resolvable?** Unknown - still waiting for response from Rivian
* **Steps to Fix:** Unknown - still waiting for response from Rivian

**Issue:** Truck was delivered with a ""Software Update Failed - Contact Rivian"" error

* **Description:** No option to update software at all. Just states to Contact Rivian
* **Rivian Contacted?** Y
* **Resolvable?** Y
* **Steps to Fix:** Rivian Support pushed a new downloadable software version about a day after I called, installed with no issues. (It was a newer update version than the one that failed)

**- - - - - - WINDOWS**

**Issue:** Auto open/close window stops working (driver or front passenger)

* **Description:** I noticed that the auto close on my driver side window was no longer working after a recent software update (don’t know if it was the update, though). I was told the steps to recalibrate the window, which was really easy (see below).
* **Rivian Contacted:** Y
* **Resolvable:** Y
* **Steps to fix:** Start with the window fully closed, press and hold the window button down until the window fully opens, but hold for an additional 5 seconds more. Repeat going all the way closed, holding for and additional 5 seconds. The window should now be recalibrated. (I held for a 6 second count in my head just to be sure. 😅)

**Issue:** Excessive wind noise from deformed triangle window weather stripping

* **Description:** Speeds above 55 produce asymmetric wind noise isolated to the offending window. source confirmed via taping off weather stripping and noise dissapearing.
* **Rivian Contacted?** Y
* **Resolvable?** Y
* **Steps to Fix:** Contact Rivian Service, fixable via mobile service appointment.

**Issue:** Passenger Window weather stripping and plastic trim piece behind the mirror coming off.

* **Description:** The double stick tape used to hold this piece in place is coming off, resulting in the piece separating form the vehicle. Wind noise is very obvious and disappears when pushed back in to place. Can actually see the piece separating and nearly falling off when it comes unstuck.
* **Rivian Contacted?** Y. Twice.
* **Resolvable?** Y
* **Steps to fix:** Contact Rivian. Wait 7 days. Contact them again. Get told it is being escalated. Again. Should be fixable via mobile appointment, but they would rather me go to the Service Center in San Francisco.

**Issue**: ""Right rear outer belt molding coming apart""

* **Description**: Black plastic molding and rubber at base of rear passenger window pulling away from door and bowing upward
* **Rivian Contacted?** Y; took two appt as wrong piece was ordered for first pass
* **Resolvable?** Y
* **Steps to Fix**: New molding/rubber assembly ordered and fully replaced. Issue not fully resolved as there is no hole in the door to allow for the retaining screw to keep end in place (mobile service R1T had early VIN and hole was present but screw was missing). Issue could happen again without manual drilling of hole and screw installation.

**Issue:** Window operations cancel

* **Description:** Operating a window control when another control for that window is already in operation cancels the original operation.
* **Rivian Contacted?** N
* **Resolvable?** Should be (software?)
* **Steps to Fix:** N/A

**- - - - - - TRUCK BED / TONNEAU**

**Issue:** tonneau cover won’t open all the way

* **Description:** press the button to open and it goes about 20% of the way open and stops. Hold the button and you can force it open but it sounds like things are breaking!
* **Rivian contacted:** yes
* **Resolvable:** yes
* **Steps to fix:** Ticket in.

**- - - - - - INTERIOR**

**Issue:** Panel behind rear seats is warping.

* **Description:** The Panel behind the rear seats is warping slowly due to the heat. You can see the portion that has warped when you look in the review mirror.
* **Rivian Contacted?** Y
* **Resolvable?** TBD
* **Steps to fix:** Unsure as it is still in the “diagnostic” stage on their end. Once it becomes “ready”, they are going to combine it with my other ticket as this one actually needs to be resolved at a service center.
* UPDATE - Called Rivian for the third time. This ticket is still in the “diagnostic” stage and the Rep was unsure as to why, so they escalated it (again). I’m honestly not looking forward to the actual Service Dept appointment as I feel like my Truck is going to be gone for several days in what should be a 2-3 hour fix.

**Issue:** Left front air vent does not point to the right

* **Description:** Left front air vent is stuck pointing towards the window, closing and opening the vent doesn't fix it.
* **Rivian Contacted:** Y
* **Resolvable:** Y
* **Steps to fix:** Rivian recalibrates the vents, software fix but can't be done by user.

**Issue:** AC system is unresponsive to directional inputs and appears to have restricted airflow.

* **Solution:** Turn off the offending vent and wait 10 seconds before turning it on. This ""resets"" the vent and you'll be able to aim it and receive a lot more air from it.
* **Origin:** Software bug. See also the truck forgetting settings.

**- - - - - - MISC**

**Issue**: Truck vibrates and hums when AC is running.

* **Description**: Truck has a vibration in the floor of the truck when the AC is running. Sounds like something is potentially rubbing against a fan. Immediately stops when the AC is turned off. I can feel the vibration in the acceleration pedal and the passenger feels it in the floor. The humming is very noticeable and annoying if there's no music playing.
* **Rivian Contacted**? Y
* **Resolvable**? Awaiting Rivian Response and Resolution
* **Steps to Fix**: Awaiting Rivian Response and Resolution

**Issue:** Steep driveway, vehicle keeps moving when brake is released

* **Description:** my driveway is relatively steep going up to the garage. When the front two wheels are on the steep part of the driveway and the back two wheels are on the flat part of the driveway, the vehicle does not slow down and does the exact opposite. I let off the brakes and the vehicle starts to roll forward. Only pushing the brakes all the way will engage hold feature but as soon as a barely tap the accelerator, vehicle starts to accelerate even when letting off the throttle. I have to feather the brakes instead of the throttle to slowly inch forward.
* **Rivian Contacted?** Y
* **Resolvable?** N
* **Steps to Fix:** they’re sending to engineering to evaluate.

**Issue:** Key FOB doesn't work

* **Description:** Key FOB doesn't work
* **Rivian Contacted?** Y
* **Resolvable?** Y
* **Steps to Fix:** Factory sent a new FOB to the local service center. Mobile service came out and set up the new FOB. Took them about 30 min

**Issue:** Camp Speaker doesn't charge when docked

* **Description:** Camp Speaker will dock in truck and lock but won't charge. Camp Speaker UI in center screen does not recognize that the speaker is in the dock. Camp Speaker charges via USB cable.

New Email From Rivian about Deliveries

In May, we reached out to some of you, via survey and Guide conversations, to see if you were interested in reconfiguring your preorder to take delivery sooner. The volume and enthusiasm of the responses told us it was a path worth exploring. We tested this approach with customers across a spectrum of preorder dates to ensure it would be valuable, and now that we’re ready to launch this new online experience, we’ll no longer need to send individual email surveys to additional customers.

Introducing the R1 Shop

This month, we’ll introduce the R1 Shop, an online experience that gives invited preorder holders the opportunity to swap their current R1 configuration* for a new configuration with expected delivery in the next 6-8 weeks or sooner.

The first shop invitations will go out to some of our earliest R1T preorder holders this week, and we’ll continue to add invites on a rolling basis weighing factors like preorder date, current configuration, and vehicle availability. Once invited, you'll have access to the R1 Shop for one week, to give as many of you who are ready to make the shift the chance to do so.

Rivian will continue to build to order, however, there are often opportunities to more quickly receive your vehicle if you have flexibility in your configuration. The R1 Shop has been created to allow you to look at vehicles that are available due to last-minute order changes from other customers as well as our intentional use of batching for some of our more popular combinations. Of course, if you prefer to get exactly the configuration you preordered, this process won’t impact you.

Refreshed Delivery Window Estimates

This week, we’ll be updating delivery window estimates for some preorder holders. This first round will prioritize two groups of customers:

Preorder holders with updated delivery window estimates in 2022

A 2022 window means purchase day is in sight! There’s a lot to coordinate, from vehicle trade-ins to quotes for insurance and financing. Your window will let you know when it’s time to start thinking through the details.

Preorder holders who no longer have delivery window estimates in 2022

As we’ve continued to ramp production, we’ve seen some customers’ delivery windows move up while others push back. This includes much anticipated updates to many of our R1S preorder holders. For those who’d previously received an estimated window in 2022 but will now be later than that, we want you to have this update so that you can adjust your plans accordingly.

For all other preorder holders, we plan to share updated delivery window estimates on a rolling basis through the remainder of the year.

We hope all of this adds some clarity on when to expect your Rivian. We’re so excited for you to get behind the wheel, and we know that you are, too.

If you have any questions, please reach out.

2022.15.0
A few days into the update.  Some observations….

1. Not loving the adjustments to the accelerator pedal.  Seems to introduce a little lag. I like having my head snap against the headrest at launch time.  Feels less snappy 

2. Auto high beams has been fantastic. Reflection off newer stop signs will turn them off, but I’m good with better safe than sorry.  Don’t enjoy blinding the oncoming car and risk them drifting into me

3. Garage door is easy and effective.  Has good range too.  Can open while still turning into my driveway (150 ft) and feel like Batman returning to the Batcave as I zoom in while the door is still moving.  I don’t like that when backing out of the garage you can’t access the door.  So now I need to back out, stop, press park, close door, hit reverse again to start moving.   Uggggg.  The backup cams take over the whole display and you have no access to garage.

4. Key improvements seem like major regression bugs.  Nothing works here.  Says my and my wife’s phone are not finished setting up, but if you try, it errors out.  Shows no fob, no band, no cards registered, yet my guide set them all up 2 months ago on delivery.  This whole thing needs a hot fix quickly

Ongoing issues:

1. Please fix the damn user manual in the car.  The search bar is frustrating and unresponsive.  Been this way since launch.  Just a bad user experience 

2. Where the heck is 24 hour clock mode???  How is this not prioritized in the backlog? 

3. Auto tailgate works about 20% of the time.  Conditions need to be perfect.  Any angle to the road and gravity won’t do it’s job.  Just assume you have to press the button and lower it manually"

Best practice charging for road trips
Hi all,

I was hoping to both renew discussion and get insight into best practice in charging for road trips and adventures. I’m sure for more of “adventures” when I’m more remote I won’t bat an eye charging up at full as I can if I’m going to need all the extra miles I can get before I see a charger again. However, what about more of a freeway/highway road-trip? I have a 4-4.5 hour / 300 mile trip coming up and not sure how best to do it. Do I start at 70 or 80%? Do I stop once or twice? I’ve mapped it out on navigation and PlugShare and they both show two short stops, and ABRP shows one stop but arriving at 10% battery. This is quite the learning curve to plan trips with… 😅😇"

250miles on R1T - initial impressions
Perhaps I should have worked today… but with a brand new Rivian, how could I? 

All work and no play is not a recipe for long term happiness, so I took the R1T on a ski adventure. 

I am on day two of ownership and have 250 miles logged so far. I drove it in the sunshine, rain, and snow. I drove it in tight city streets, winding mountain roads and suburban strip malls with their dreaded speed bumps. I charged 120V as well as L2 & L3 fast chargers (I got to 150+). I hung out inside the vehicle, on the passenger side with the seat way back admiring the clouds over my head, and learned some interesting behaviors of what the car does when we leave it behind. I also noticed a much warmer interior when I left the car for a few hours than I would have imagined. (I’ll be sharing with my awesome guide).  

I’ve got a bunch of pictures and a few short video clips of Ah Ha moments figuring out the interface, which I’ll share as I have time to organize and write up. For now, I’ll offer one “WOW” and one “Really?” 

Wow, I love the R1T. My son Jared called it a Teleportation device because when you hit “Sport/Stiff” it teleports you into a McLaren. The same folks that did their suspension did Rivians, and it shows. I’ve never driven a McLaren, but I did own and track a Ferrari Marenello and a 911 Turbo and truly, the R1T is right up there on a winding road. Of course it won’t outperform today’s supersports cars, but consider the 0-60 in the 3s and the handling with that battery providing a low and balanced center of gravity complemented by the air suspension tuned by racing pros. Wowed me. Then, I hit All Purpose in the snow and I’ve got an awesome truck. It really does seem like a teleportation button that can beam you between sports car and truck. The Sports Truck moniker just doesn’t quite due justice to how impressive the R1T is.  

The only thing I am conflicted about is The Driver+ / Driver assist features. I love bleeding edge, and the capabilities are limited - few would call it a leader in the category in terms of these self-driving features. I found myself asking, “Really?” 

The reason why I am conflicted is that I am just about to finish co-authoring a book on the fundamental limitations of AI – folks like Musk are applying a very risky application of AI. Take a read of the first few chapters https://www.speakerrex.com/Briggs\_AI\_Limitations\_BookExcerpt.pdf (written by my co-author) and it might just blow your mind to think about how AI really works. (If you like the book, DM me your mailing address and I’ll send you a copy when it goes to print, on me / no charge.) Considering my professional research on the topic of AI, I’m not going to compare Rivian’s Driver+ to Tesla. Tesla is in a different league, but it is also at the bleeding edge of AI – and sometimes that blood is an inattentive driver or parked emergency vehicle. I respect Rivian’s restraint. 

However, Driver+ will only engage on freeways. Driver+ would not engage on divided two lane highway 26 between Portland and Mt. Hood. This is an area where my BMW X7 will use lane keep assist with adaptive cruise control without complaint. The R1T, on the other hand, will only provide adaptive cruise control. Even the 2021 Rav4 would engage lane keep on this road. While Rav4 lane keep is a bit clumsy on sweeping turns compared to my BMW’s assist, it was better than nothing, which is what R1T offers in this situation. 

If there was one single OTA I’d ask for is Drive+ enhancements, specifically:

1. Lane keep to highways, 
2. Traffic stop and go functionality for freeway driving (the R1T cancels when it stops)
EDIT: 3-18-2022 - It does stop and go on freeway, but leaves a big gap that has to be closed manually, and then it starts again. On roads with curves, where adaptive cruise control is activated, it will drop the adaptive part, but doesn't clearly show that it has done that, and then you are the breaks... so this feature could be improved. 

3. Resuming Driver+ after changing lanes with a blinker (I’d be OK if it doesn’t change the lane for me, which BMW X7 does but Toyota Rav does not). 

PS: Here’s a trivia question for upvotes: Who can identify the lodge I visited today and the movie it was in where a fictional author seemed to agree with my opening comment about all work and no play…?"

Cybertruck delayed. Getting a Rivian
Hello all. Huge Tesla fan. They are building factories everywhere. Anyway the truck is delayed again. I live in Oak Ridge, TN and we have had a person in the area driving a Rivian. Didn’t get to speak to the person. 

Anyway I’m new here have some questions.

Tesla charging network is getting huge. Can Rivian use them? And if I reserved today how long would it take? Did I read full production won’t start for awhile?

Thanks"

Rivian Charging: 800V vs 400V?
# 800V or 400V?

Like many of you, I've been thinking a lot about what battery and charging voltage Rivian will use for the R1T and R1S. We have a few nuggets of information from Rivian, some of it conflicting. In an interview with RJ last year, he said that Rivians would be [capable of charging at 300kW](https://www.youtube.com/watch?t=683&v=xDsXYCGJ5_s&feature=youtu.be) (which is only possible on 800V architecture at this time). But in a [2018 interview](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1120589_rivian-r1t-pickup-r1s-suv-ready-for-future-800v-upgradepossibly-in-2022) he said that they've architected the vehicle for higher voltage charging, but ""that won’t be at day one."" The only information listed in writing is a sentence on the Rivian website stating that the battery thermal system allows for [charging at over 200kW for sustained periods of time](https://i.imgur.com/iJRROJT.png).

In the last year, we have seen a bunch of features disappear and we haven't heard anything more official about the maximum charging power. In the past few months, I've seen a couple interesting bits of evidence that would suggest that the Rivians will actually only have 400V architecture. I'll outline my evidence below.

# Charging Time Math

To start, I decided to try and map the charging time that Rivian lists to an actual kW power level. If I did my math correctly, I think this maps out to the average power over the charge time, NOT the peak power.

Can people check my math on this?

Rivian has consistently said that their vehicles will charge [140 miles in 20 minutes](https://rivian.com/support/article/what-are-charge-station-levels) at the Rivian Adventure Network:

* 140 miles charged per 20 mins / 300 miles total range = 46.7% of a battery per 20 mins
* 46.7% per 20 mins \* 135 kWh (Large Pack size) = 63 kWh charged per 20 minutes
* 63 kWh charged per 20 minutes = 63 kWh / .333 h  = 189 kW
* This would mean that for those 20 mins of charging the 140 miles, the Rivian would be pulling an average of **189 kW**

If my math is correct, this is much lower than previously speculated and further makes me believe that the Rivians will only be able to charge at **400V**. If the Rivians could charge at 800V, why wouldn't this average charging power be higher? The Taycan is 800V and [averages in the 200kW range](https://www.electrive.com/2020/03/25/p3-charging-index-which-electric-car-charges-best-on-long-distance-trips/) for 20-80% (seeing peaks much higher for it's lower charge levels).

# Charging at the Rebelle Rally

In [this article](https://www.cnet.com/roadshow/pictures/rivian-r1t-power-innovations-charging/6/) about charging at the Rebelle Rally, written by Emme Hall (the driver), she says that while the chargers could charge at 175kW, ""the fastest I saw the R1T accept charge was at 130 kW."" From the images in the article, the [charger appears to be](https://cnet1.cbsistatic.com/img/wYXm6Hr9vunbsXG0hye1uaCvxxg=/980x0/2020/10/29/f3d5e9b8-723d-45c5-b4dd-77e247b31b21/a-richardgiordano-daythree-286.jpg) an [ABB Terra HP 175](https://library.e.abb.com/public/ffebef28c136483990435f79fb17d67b/ABB_Terra-HP_UL_G2_Data-SheetR5.pdf), which is equipped with a 375A CCS1 Cable. If the Rivian was 800V, it would be capable of charging at the full 175kW. But if it was only 400V, it would be limited to a maximum peak charge of **150kW**. A 400V architecture *could* explain why Hall never saw a charge above 130kW (along with environmental conditions and state of charge).

# Charging Specs of the Rivian Adventure Network

The newly leaked Rivian Adventure Network chargers have been a topic of frenzied discussion this past week. The [leaked spec sheet](https://i.imgur.com/S51bOQ4.png) describes a charger and power cabinet with an impressive output up to 300kW. However, I believe that this 300kW number is actually just the output from the Power Cabinet itself, or possibly the output from two of the power cabinets.

Looking at other available DC dispensers which have 300+ kW charging capability and all need to have at least 2 Power Cabinets connected per dispenser to reach that power level ([ABB](https://new.abb.com/news/detail/4439/abb-powers-e-mobility-with-launch-of-first-350-kw-high-power-car-charger), [BTC Power](https://www.btcpower.com/index.php?action=350kw-DCFC), [Tritium](https://tritiumcharging.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/11/TRI105.DTA_.002_Veefil-PK350-Specifications.pdf)). Digging deeper into the site plans, you can see that Rivian is planning to have 4 DC fast charger dispensers, but [only two Power Cabinets on the site](https://i.imgur.com/Cp6jevV.png). Thus, I believe that Rivian is sharing the power from each power cabinet between 2 stations, making the maximum power available to a vehicle when all stations are in use only 150kW (assuming Rivian's cabinet outputs 300kW) and if you're the only vehicle there, perhaps up to 300kW (if you are allocated power from both cabinets).

If the 300kW spec is more in line with the currently available competition and comes from a 2 Cabinet to 1 Dispenser configuration, the numbers will be even lower...

# Conclusion

I know this is a lot of information and much of it is speculative, but I've spent a lot of time compiling this information and I look forward to having you all poke some holes in my logic. I would love nothing more than to have my future R1S be capable of 800V charging, but everything I have seen here makes it seem like 400V is what we should expect..."

New message from Rivian: Happy New Year!
Full email content:

“I hope you and your families are safe and well. Thank you for your continued support over the past year. You’ve had to wait a bit longer than anticipated for your Rivian, but your excitement hasn’t waned and we feel it, even from a distance.

This will be a historic year for Rivian. With deliveries of our R1T and R1S beginning this summer, as well as the launch of our last mile commercial vans for Amazon in the fall, we couldn’t be more excited. I started Rivian 11 years ago, and while our strategy has evolved considerably relative to the initial plan, at our core, the objective has always been the same — maximize our positive impact on the planet. These products are only the start of what we are building. We are working to further scale Rivian and our product offerings to help build the kind of world our kids and our kids’ kids deserve.

PREPARING FOR PRODUCTION
With our first deliveries only a few months away, we’re testing our vehicles and systems across every climate and condition you might encounter. I’ve been driving an R1T over the last few months and my kids have kicked, scratched and spilled on every surface in the vehicle. :) This is what they’re made for. Life. I can’t wait for you to get to experience these vehicles day in and day out and make your own memories in them.

OWNING A RIVIAN
Owning a Rivian should feel as delightful as driving one. Our vehicles have been developed to require minimal service, but in the event that anything needs attention, servicing a Rivian will be convenient regardless of where you live. We are building a network of mobile service vans and physical service centers so that we can either come to you or we can come pick up your vehicle and bring it in to one of our service locations.  

We are also building the Rivian Adventure Network — a large network of DC fast chargers — to make it easy for you to go anywhere on the map. As we build this network, we’re focused on the most popular routes and destinations first. While we won’t have every point on the map connected on day one, our goal is to build the most explorer-centric charging network in the world. In addition to this DC charging network, we’re installing Level 2 chargers at many of the longer-stay and overnight destinations. Beyond our Rivian network, we're ensuring our vehicles easily integrate with third-party networks, and given that the majority of charging will happen at home, we’ll have a home charging option available, too. We’ll be announcing the initial charger locations later this year, and this charger map will be integrated with our in-vehicle and mobile applications. 

GATHERING AGAIN
Before the pandemic, we had the pleasure of hosting events around the country and meeting many of you in person. These were incredibly memorable moments for our team and we look forward to bringing people together again safely in 2021. We’ll be launching 10 experience centers across the U.S. in 2021 —  each one connecting you to the people, places and things you love.

Thank you for being on this journey with us. We’ll be in touch soon with more updates on test drives, additional configuration options and more. 

I wish all of you a great 2021!

RJ inteview: on branding (older, May 2018)
 

I just saw this older article from May 2018, a RJ interview [https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17380600/rivian-electric-truck-pickup-suv-interview-rj-scaringe](https://www.theverge.com/2018/5/23/17380600/rivian-electric-truck-pickup-suv-interview-rj-scaringe)

There is a conversation about the branding stuff:

**Can  you give me a bit more perspective on who it is that you expect to be  buying these vehicles? It sounds like you’re moving into a part of the  EV market that is relatively unexplored right now, which seems like a  very good business proposition. But the more I hear the word  “adventure,” the more I think, “Well, that’s not going to be for  everybody.”**

If we take a step  back and we think about what we’re launching, at our core, our first  product is we’re launching a brand. And that brand needs to connect with  customers. It needs to have something that they aspire to. And that  aspiration, it’s very important that it can transcend all the changes  we’re going to see. And we’re going to be working to drive over the next  several decades: a shift away from ownership, a shift away from  steering wheels. And when we think about the brand we’re setting up, in  many ways I draw the analogy to music. Brand is like culture in that  it’s hard to describe with ones and zeros. It’s not something that’s  easy to quantify. But the music we’re going to start off with, and the  music we’re going to set up with our launch products, is going to be  speaking to this idea of exploring.

When  you say the word “adventure,” as you said, it maybe comes up with this  sort of sharp point that feels like, “Well, I don’t climb a mountain  every day. How would I use this vehicle?” But what we believe is that  all the changes we’re going to see over the next 10, 20, 30, 40 years,  all the things we can’t predict in terms of how those changes are going  to play out, the one thing I can say that I don’t think will change is  the desire of human beings to go to new places and to see new things.

And  so we’re starting our brand, we’re starting our music, with a set of  products that make that statement fairly loudly. So it’s analogous to  using electric guitar and a set of drums to really make that statement.  As we layer in new products, we’ll play the same music but with  different instruments, so they won’t necessarily be as loud. They won’t  have the same level of performance, they won’t have the same level of  off-road capability. But the reason to launch with something that’s so  remarkable in terms of its on and off-road performance is to make a very  clear statement: this is a vehicle that could take you anywhere without  compromise.

When we think about some of  the greatest brands — not just automotive but outside in the  electronics space or the camera space — the sharp point of those brands,  the “Porsche on a racetrack” moment for those brands, doesn’t  necessarily characterize the everyday use case.

Porsche,  I think, is a very good example. People buy the product not to take it  on a racetrack, but the brand is built around the idea of a racetrack  and performance and motorsports. So in our case, our sharp point, our  “Porsche on a race track” moment is the vehicle rolling up to the edge  of the beach, climbing up the side of the mountain, going off the path  to the edge of the trail. But the everyday adventure that it works so  well for by being so good at those extreme adventures is the trip around  the corner to Ikea, picking the kids up from school, the trip on a  Sunday afternoon to grandma’s house.

And  the fact that you can have a product that works well in those sharp  branded use cases or those aspirational environments as well as those  everyday environments, we think is quite powerful, and it helps us  establish something that people can connect with as we move into  different flavors, as we move into different instruments in terms of how  we’re playing that same music."

I Feel Guilty For Owning A Tesla
Sorry for the poor formatting and editing: I am writing this by phone

I started majoring in EECS at MIT in 2018 as a 17 year old boy and later graduated in 2022, having held 3 internships by then (an unpaid internship in 2017, a paid internship at a software company in 2019, and a FAANG internship in 2020). 

After graduation, I was thinking of taking a paid temporary software consulting position/business opportunity as an aspiring AI entrepreneur for Summer 2023 in California (it never happened) to experience living there. That fueled my obsession for a car. Also, I have been a car enthusiast since childhood and ever since I was 11 (before Elon Musk shifted right), I have dreamed of owning a Tesla. 

Since Spring of 2022, I have been intermittently working as a remote software consultant for several major tech companies whilst also working on my AI projects/research, and investing, mainly for financial stability, and that meant I have the money for a car for occasional cross country road trips, weekend tours around the Northeast of the US, and Doordashing as a hobby (for a purpose of going outside since I am mostly remote, outside the days where I meet in person, mostly for my tech startup).

Even though I had a drivers licence since 2019 (18 years old), owning a car is a liability where I live (given the off street parking price per month and the fact I would have to move my car very often if I was street parking), so I held back on owning a car (despite having at least a million in assets due to the Tesla stock boom in 2020-1).

Until Summer 2022.

In November 2021, I sold my stock (half the stock I owned was Tesla) just as recession fears started unraveling due to inflation. I poured in at least 75 thousand USD of my internship money for Tesla in October 2019, and I received a huge ROI.

Due to the fact Teslas were still overpriced as of August 2022 and Elon Musk's views started to shift towards the far right (I was already concerned about his lockdown views and move to Texas by then), I never considered a Tesla.

I was also turned down by used cars because used cars were overpriced (August 2022 was the peak), so I instead resorted to a new car. I looked towards a Toyota Corolla, Mazda3, and Hyundai Elantra, but then, when Tesla lowered the Model 3 prices, I still didn't consider Tesla due to the fact I wanted to wait and see what the Highland and Juniper offers.

I kept on bleating about the Hyundai Elantra (early 2023) until the Kona came out, and when the Volvo EX30 came out in June (I was in Milan the day before the EX30 was announced), I decided to switch my obsession towards Volvo. 

Funnily, my 75 year old father in Vietnam who is a prominent healthcare official and multi millionaire in Vietnam actually owns a Volvo XC40, which motivated me to switch my minds to a Volvo. Before 2021, he owned a slew of Mercedes Benz E Classes for 28 years ranging from the W124 to the W213. 

Even though the Tesla Model 3 has a proven track record compared with the Volvo EX30, in my mind, the Volvo has better build quality, support for Apple CarPlay/Android Auto, includec safety and autonomous features such as auto park assist, etc, and is more manueverable as it is 165 inches in length and I live in Cambridge.

Then comes September 2023. The Tesla Model 3 Highland came out and by the time EX30 reviews came in Europe in November, I started slowly switching my minds back to the Tesla Model 3 as in my beliefs, the Highland is more likely to come out to the US before the EX30.

That is despite the fact Elon has gone further right and despite the fact I further despise Elon Musk for his unhingedness.

In January 2024, the Highland was released and based on my analysis, not much has changed, so I decided to go with a used Tesla due to me not qualifying for tax rebates/credits.

In June 2024, I upgraded my Scion XD (which is ageing and rusting) to a 2021 Tesla Model 3 for 25k and I chose Tesla for a few reasons:

In Cambridge, EV infrastructure is decent (my city offers municipal chargers which cost 20 cents per kwh and are half a mile away from my apartment). In my calculation, that is kind of like owning a 55 mpg Prius and using a $3 per gallon gas station 

I am also planning to move to another apartment soon, which meant I might be able to have an off street parking solution, which meant I might be able to use a Level 1 charger, which would further facilitate charging. That in turn makes charging cheaper than gas. I am also an environmentalist, so I support EVs, public transportation, and biking

When charging outside, using a Tesla Supercharger on a Tesla is cheaper than using a Tesla Supercharger whilst also having a dongle on a Ford/Rivian and having to pay a subscription. Tesla Supercharger price per kwh is also more affordable than Electrify America, Chargepoint, or EVGo

Tesla Model 3 has a more efficient watt hours per mile than other cars, further lessening the costs

The technology is better in some areas (say the infotainment OS) and worse in others

It is also easier to find a Model 3 than a Mach E/Ioniq 5/BMW i4/Polestar/Volvo XC40 recharge/EV6 (six of my runner ups) for under 25k

With all of this said, I bought a Tesla Model 3, and even though I love my Tesla (apart from a few issues), I feel kind of alienated from my Tesla, due to Elon's shift towards Nazi salutes, sabotaging the economy through DOGE, and being fully entrenched in the far right. He has even attempted to infiltrate into Germany's political system, trying to lobby for the AfD to win nationwide.

Elon's recent antics made me feel uncomfortable and it made me consider selling my Tesla at a loss, even if I really love the car.

I am just a frugal man. I don't want to bear the financial loss, be broke, and not have the money to funnel into my tech startup.

I am scared people might perceive me as a far right sympathizer for liking my Tesla. But the fact is, I despise fascism.

Also, I do understand that Henry Ford espoused some racist views, that VW/VAG was founded by Hitler, and that Toyota has become so anti environment."

Wuling Air EV review
Hello fellow EV enthusiasts, so here's a review of Wuling Air EV (oof, intro so stiff I can be mistaken for a China propagandist)

So once upon a time Shanghai Automotive Industry Corporation, GM and Wuling (SGMW) decided to collaborate to spearheaded new energy vehicle revolution by selling the cheapest no frill EV in China. The collaboration birthed the Baojun E100 in 2017, an electric microcar in the same breath as Smart Fortwo. The line became SGMW best sellers in China because of its entry level price and the company decided to go global with line in 2020.

I'm not going into detail the MANY brands SGMW sells their product, I will just focus on the Wuling brand sold in Indonesia.

The Wuling Air EV is sold globally starting in 2022 in Indonesia followed the year after in India. It's not the instant hit SGMW expected, but sales are strong pushed by government subsidies. The Air EV by far was the cheapest EV where it debuted. It still holds the cheapest EV in Indonesia with the new entry level ""Lite"" variant.

I bought the Wuling Air EV long range type with these specs:

* 30 kw (40 HP) rear motor
* 26.7 kwh lithium ferro phosphate battery
* 300 km range claimed, non verified
* 6.6 kw AC charge
* wheelbase 2010 mm
* lwh: 2974 x 1505 x 1631 mm

I deleted a lot of drafts to write this one since I don't know how to start with the review but TLDR, the car is just a basic commuter that works with all the cost of ownership saving that comes with EV ownership vs ICE.

And here's the detailed review... So yeah it's a small dinky car that goes down deep in the cost saving hole. The cost saving was quite extreme that it affects driving and seating position. The car seats very high not just because the battery is under the car, but also the e-motor. On proper EV, the motor sits higher than the battery, either on the back or on the front of the chassis that allows the cabin to be lower on the ground along with the battery. On the Air EV, the motor sits inline with the battery with the floor of the car flat on top of it. So the car is small, but I sit high like an SUV. I can see all the smug faces of diesel burning truck owners disrespecting me on red lights.

The e-motor... Oh my goodness... No fancy transaxle here, because the motor is just bolted offset to a rigid axle. Yeah, this is the only (urban) EV I think in existence that needs a differential oil change.

With a tall body like that, one thing have to give to make the car sits lower to the ground, and that's tire size. The car rides on a 12"" wheel with 145/70R12 tire. Wait, the suspension! I don't know the measurement, but it's the thinnest strut and spring mcpherson setup I ever saw. The car eats bump like sh\*t, it doesn't feel like it has any suspension whatsoever. I think I broke the suspension strut mount...

And with that, driving dynamics is non existent. It still can turn, but I always felt like it's going to tip over if I did even like 7/10. The 40 HP motor is okay, because the car weighs around 800 Kg and the e-motor torque is enough to drive around town. The max speed is limited to 105 KpH but the torque curve probably done with the car around 90 KpH... Also the car is very prone to sidewinds, so no thank you for getting to max speed.

Thankfully, driving comfort goes, the car has auto brake hold which is heaven sent because one quirk of this car is that when you put the car in drive, it doesn't have idle creep.

Interior wise... Okay, I guess... I'm 178 cm tall, I sit okay, albeit a bit upright-ish. Front leg room is generous and I think the thin front struts have its advantage here. My tweens kids sits well in the back, thanks to the car tall roofline that 2010 mm wheelbase is pushed to the edge for the seating arrangement... Which makes the term trunk is debatable at this point. This car have a trunk? Eh, I'll call it more like a cubby hole, with about 10-12 cm of opening on the back.

Amenities are sparse, no glovebox. Physical AC controls, everything else is controlled by the big useless touch screen. Luckily I can put the screen on ""standby"" mode which only shows a big clock.

Seems all negative? Yeah, if it's not for EV benefits this car is trash, but thanks to it. Holy hell all the cost saving I got from owning this car. From US$200 for monthly fuel on using my ICE car to work, now I only need to pay US$20 for electricity bill. Also government subsidy means I only need to pay... And you guys are not reading this wrong... Yearly tax of just US$1. My ICE car yearly tax is US$400. Also saving on ICE cars usual oil change every 4 months.... Well at least the differential oil on the Air EV is like every 2 year or so. Also I got free charging port at my house, beats waiting in line at the fuel pump and no more worries about monthly price change of fuel.

Why don't I change to a bigger EV? Price. My Air EV cost me US$15,000, and the next cheapest EV is the Wuling Binguo at US$20,000. Since I'm a single income father of two with one needing special care, I already have to work three jobs to maintain everything. So every US$1000 increase is an exponential hill to climb for me. Still, I'm grateful for my Wuling. I don't like it, but it's the best that I can have right now.

P.S. Sorry for the image structure, this is my first time posting images here.

P.P.S. Why I chose Wuling. The company has a lifetime warranty clause for the battery and motor with a yearly 30,000 Km limit. So it's a lucrative scheme for me who is worried about EV battery/motor longevity.

A rough cost breakdown on EV vs ICE
https://preview.redd.it/jl9mhlbsdh6e1.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=2763ee90546d3a74221d08dee5507edb5e7a7749

Basically I wanted to break down the cost between a EV and ICE mostly for fun. I used a newer blazer ICE vs EV. I did this because they are pretty similar in body and what not, so I figured it was a good way to compare ICE vs EV.

I maxed out the the features of both as if I was buying but note this only adds a few thousand by the end of the 12 year calculation. But it should be noted there wasn't too many options when it came to the EV. If I just focused on the base price without any add on. It came out to this.

Note the cost above does include the most advance wall charger, but not the cost to install it. The reason why I used $0.4 kwh is the Tesla ones appear to cost that near me and looking around that is pretty close to the average. Note I don't have an EV and way too poor for any of this. I'm doing this for fun, but because my lack of experience with EV cars the numbers might be slightly off or I might of forgot some stuff. 

https://preview.redd.it/rafn7ylreh6e1.png?width=1196&format=png&auto=webp&s=0e93827baa29a9c44a7de5945b277d1d03663016

I got a quote from an insurance company. The overall cost I basically broke down the upfront to 12 years since that seems to be the average for people keeping their car. And it appears the average American drives 15k miles a year. 

  
Anyways, as you can see the difference isn't all that much. Because I don't have an EV and honestly I am too poor to mess with new trucks, I'm not sure how much hands on most get with newer stuff and EV. So I couldn't calculate the time difference. And charging is mostly a wash since you can use fast chargers or just trickle charge from home. You likely will be charging or fueling every 100-200 miles anyways. And with t he fast charging you're looking at 10 min which is about the time it takes to fuel a truck. The advantage however comes in when you trickle charge from home over night since it cuts that out all together. 

  
I would highly be interested in knowing if the battery or drive motor on a EV can be worked on from home. And if not, the average cost to do any fixes. Outside of that, it appears everything else is the same when it comes to time other than breaks. Like the breaking is less, but the hands on seems to be pretty close. 

Because of my lack of experience I couldn't factor in long term issues and fixes, where I have a metric ton of experiences with ICE. And honestly I am extremely interested in this for used EV since again being poor I'm not getting anything new. Which is why I'm also interested in the DIY for the battery and drive motor upkeep. 

  
Something I didn't factor in is battery degrade or the fact that heating a EV hits the range where in ICE this isn't a problem. Keep in mind the engine is hot already in a ICE so it uses that. From my understanding cooling or heating a EV does a 10% - 20% hit on the range. AC in a ICE takes about 10% more gas. Plus I think this changes massively based on where you live since in some places you might use it more or less. Also again my experience on this isn't there. And then from my understanding some EV have heat pumps and others don't? IDK how much of a role that plays on the range or how useful that is. 

  
**Anyways, if you see any major problems with this then let me know. This was meant to be fun and it is a rough look at it.** 

P.S. it appears when EV can get ranges like 1k miles and insurance gets better. It becomes more of a no brainer."

Rivian has a ""Drive Unit"" problem
Posting my experience to raise awareness:

I recently purchased a brand-new 2025 Rivian R1S, but just 24 hours and 10 miles into owning it, the vehicle broke down. The driver's console displayed a ""Driving Disabled"" message, along with a prompt to ""Service your SUV"" (see the image here: https://ibb.co/Wz3n3fL).

After struggling to get clear answers, I was first told the issue was related to a sensor. However, after the vehicle was on it's way to be returned to me, it broke down again. This time, Rivian informed me that the problem was with the ""drive unit,"" which needed to be replaced.

It’s been two weeks since i had the car for ONE day, and I'm still waiting for any progress. Despite asking for a refund or a replacement vehicle, Rivian has refused. To make matters worse, they haven’t provided a loaner car while mine is being repaired.

This shouldn’t happen with any new car, especially one costing around $100,000. I’m left angry/frustrated, waiting for a resolution??, and hoping others will take note of these recurring issues.

A week with a Polestar as a Tesla owner
Hertz had a good special on a Polestar down in central Florida so I rented one for the week. I've been a Tesla Model 3 owner since December 2023. 

There were some things I really liked about the Polestar (either a 2 or 4, not the SUV) and I could see it's market share growing, but I also felt some of it's limitations.

What I liked:

The in-car entertainment system being built on Google excelled compared to Tesla. Having access to google maps was a dream, and it integrated with the car's battery so I could see charging stations and battery status. 

The trunk had a spacious opening, so a device like a walker could easily be stored in the trunk, something I can't do with a model 3 due to the shape of the trunk. 

The ability to install apps opens up a huge potential for software development.

The car drove well, had a good feel to it and was overall fun to drive. 

I felt like the car was a bit higher off the road than the Tesla Model 3 is. This was nice for older riders, and I liked the grab bars, which my Tesla lacks. 

Things I didn't like: 

The most annoying thing. I had to manually select Bluetooth audio every time I began a drive. Why can't it remember? 

No Phone Control for rentals. To do this, you need both keys in the car, and Hertz keeps one of the keys. Tesla has a rental car mode that you can control a rental with your phone, so this would be nice. 

It either doesn't have adaptive cruise control or I couldn't get it to work, also missed my built in dash cam and 360cams. 

Some of the controls felt clunky, especially related to the HVAC system. 

No dog mode, it's useful for more than just dogs. 

And then the whole mess of CCS charging. Worrying about if chargers will be broke, only like one or two Tesla chargers in central Florida have the built in Magic Dock, and the prices for chargers like electrify America. Holy crap. I paid $50 for 2 CCS chargers. I'd pay half that in my Tesla. On one of my trips I drove like an extra 45 minutes to get to a CCS charger, passing a Tesla station. 

If Hertz runs the special again, I'd rent it, but I wouldn't buy it. "

Kia Niro vs Chevrolet home adapter help
Edited to add: this community is toxic for downvoting a post just because i don't know anything. We should be educating each other, not putting down others for not having knowledge that they are actively seeking.

40 hours from 70-100%
This charge time can't be normal for a level 1 at home J772 charge can it? 

I got this thing as a rental from Hertz, who told me that there's no guarantee that the car comes with a charger, but found this Chevy charger in this one in the trunk. It has the right connector so Sounds great right? Wrong. When i first got home i tried to plug in to see a pretty long charge time. So i googled it to see why the thing is charging so slow. Consensus online basically said that Chevy chargers get dirty and need to be cleaned with a Qtip and isopropyl alcohol. So I got that and did this... Plugged everything back in, and I'm not sure of it, but it looks like the charging time got longer? 
Trust me I'm not too happy with the Hertz people, but these are the kind of lazy employees that will hold a greatgrudge and find a way to use it against you. I'm an Uber driver and rely on them right now. 
I'm new to EVs entirely. 
My last rental was a kia EV6 and that was a fun car that I never found charging issues with, albeit, the home charger was stolen out of it before i got it, the horn broke, and it smelled badly like cigarettes"

A Very Long Roadtrip
Hello there! I'll get right to it  
Start: Moncton, NB  
End: Detroit, MI

The vehicle: 2017 Chevrolet Bolt EV

My friends think I'm crazy having roadtripped it instead of flying, especially in such a slow to charge car. Oh well! Here's how it went: Very Well!

  
New Brunswick: Flo is dominant here. Super easy though. Mix of older 50kW stations and newer 100kW stations, made by AddEnergie. Didn't need to wait my turn anywhere and every station worked. They're easy to find in parking lots, just look for the bright orange stations!

Quebec: Flo here too. Construction everywhere. Stations everywhere! All worked with the Flo app. Never worried about where to find one because there was always one nearby. Same units as NB, but they're \~blue\~. 50 and 100, though the higher kW 180 ones were by ABB and surpriiiiise they ALL broke while on my return trip (no ABB unit was communicating with app or card), so everyone flocked to the AddEnergie units that charged along as normal.

Ontario: Mostly Ivy, some Flo. I LOVE the OnRoute concept as a whole. Big pitstop buildings with stores and restrooms and everything along the highways. Here, it was important to have an Ivy account, as that was the majority of stations. Reliability was a bit hit/miss with these though, probably because of such heavy use. Most stops had 4 stations and most had 1 or 2 down.

Detroit: So this was outside Detroit but I did use an EA station for the first time. It worked, one of the units was down. Not much else to say about that!

  
Summary: I charged approximately every 250km/155miles. The total distance was around 1900km / 1180miles each direction. 8 charging stops total, with a sleepynight in the middle (though without charging through the night). Cost was around $220 for the round trip. It was really a very pleasant drive.

  
So! To people detracting road tripping in the slowest fast-charging EV you can buy, I say Yes you Can(ada)!   
Thanks!"

Don't Buy a Nissan Leaf! Maintenance fees are a gamble....$7200 PDM repair for a 2019 Leaf
I  have driven a 2019 Nissan Leaf from March 2019 until October this year  when it broke down and I currently can't afford to fix it.  I am still  paying the 5 year car loan from Nissan but they say I'm just shit out of  luck!

So in early 2019 I was  driving a Toyota Matrix.  One day someone else was driving my car and  got into a minor accident, it was an older model and ended up being a  write off.

A family member of mine  had an idea for a local car share in my area and had told me about it.   I asked him about using a car since mine was currently no more.  He  told me to go pick up a new nissan Leaf from the dealership and use it  while he gets the software in order.  18 months later he decided there  was no software he could use that would make it worth the cost and asked  me to take over the payments.  The first 18 months were pretty good,  many fast chargers were also free in this time and I didn't pay anything  for the car.  Any limitations of the car were offset by the completely  free to drive nature.  The free ride eventually came to an end and now I  am paying off the car and paying for charging.

After  the first winter the battery had a significant loss of range that never  got back to what it was the first summer of use.  After the third  winter the battery would suddenly drop from 60% to 15% then jump back up  to 55% and etc.  Nissan says that the battery is still good, so getting  no warranty so far on this.  Now the fast charging is limited, and  often throttled.  Throttling is supposed to save the battery but it  wasn't enough I guess.

Now in  October of 2023 I have a minor accident on the rear side of the car, but  after that point my car had continued electrical issues with the EV  system, at first it was not charging to full on level 2, then not  working and giving Check EV system warning after a fast charge session  at a trusted charger.  At first they said just switch the 12V battery  and I did and it worked for a time.  But then It kept giving the warning  and I would have to detach the 12V battery and reattach to reset the  error code and it would drive for a while until it came back.  Now it  has stopped accepting level 2 charge.  Brought it back to nissan and  they say the PDM is not working and want $7200 to fix it.  At this point  I make the claim on my insurance as it all started after my collision.

Nissan  tells me that they don't know what caused the PDM to fail as they don't  diagnose them.  But they told the insurance adjuster that it definitely  wasn't my collision that made it fail.  But they will tell me they  don't know how it failed because they wont actually look inside for the  broken fuse.

So now I have a 4.5  year old car I am still paying off the 5 year car loan on, but don't  have the cash on hand today to pay Nissan $7200 to fix my car.  They  tell me that it wasn't my accident, the part just fails!  Please pay us  $7200 to drive again!  Whats the lifetime of this part?  I am at  135,000km on this car, I have driven and charged a lot, but am I  supposed to price in 5c/km driven for new PDMs in my leaf?

Shitty  parts and shitty service means I will never buy a Nissan again.  That's  an unacceptable maintenance cost for an electric vehicle.

What electric vehicle is going to have the best lifespan is my question?  In the market for a new lease...."

Why I chose a Nissan Leaf SV Plus over Tesla Model 3 and Chevy Bolt (and others)
I read about Battery Electric Vehicles (BEVs) for a few years, and read findings of

 Consumer Reports.  I was looking for a less expensive one.

  I started out my shopping in this low-end class by prioritizing BEVs that had

 been on the market for multiple years, since they have the bugs worked out of them.

  This means the Model 3, Leaf, and Bolt.

  I am aware that the Leaf, even in an SV PLus, has less range than a Model 3 and

Chevy Bolt.  However, at a reported 211 miles, it is 3x my 60 mile round trip commute.

I have a pickup already which I am keeping, so this makes me a bit of an unusual buyer

 of a BEV.  I wanted a compact commuting car.

  What broke it wide open is that in my area, eastern Massachusetts, was what looks

like a concerning situation with getting a Tesla repaired and maintained.  It appears

that unlike the traditional dealership repair shops and open supply chains, Tesla

is setting up a repair ecosystem where independant shops at a minimum need to fill

out some forms, and possibly need to go through a training to be certified.

  You start to see that something is off about getting Teslas repaired when you go

to the main Tesla web site.  Repair is found by 'Discover ??? --> Find Us'

and then you see a map.  Then you have to hit a button on a left index pop up.

Then Find Us --> Tesla Service Centers --> US Tesla Service Centers

  According to Tesla's web site at

[https://www.tesla.com/findus/list/services/United+States](https://www.tesla.com/findus/list/services/United+States)

I see four service centers in Massachusetts, a state where my reading tells me 

20,000 to 30,000 Tesla cars are sold per year.  An extroardinary bottleneck!  To

this you can counter that Tesla has some ""come to your home"" driveway repair servicing,

 and there are 32 body shops that can receive Tesla parts in the state.

  I called a good local mechanic and talked to him about what would happen if I

hypothetically bought a Model 3 and what work would he be able to undertake ""Tesla

makes it hard to get parts.  We are aware of the hoops to jump in getting signed up,

and we are only replacing tires and windshield wipers on Teslas.""

  I went online and confirmed that a motor control module could be 'added to the cart'

for both the Nissan Leaf and Chevy Bolt.  Open supply chains that any local shop

can obtain.

  I know that online people tend to report the negative experiences and don't bother

reporting the common positives, but someone in CA reported waiting 9 months to even

get his Tesla to be evaluated.  Then months more for the parts to be ordered.

You can tell that the whole Tesla business model was developed in California.  Coming

to your driveway to repair a car in a northern state?  The frost bite of toes and

hands in 20 mph winds at 10 \*F would make that job a revolving door of employees,

 some with workman's comp claims that would be completely legit on Tesla. 

&#x200B;

  I test drove a Tesla Model 3 at the one show room in the state.  Beautiful car!

I was trying to imagine rolling a car with a glass roof with metal ribs and what would

happen to my head.  Having so much control layered into one screen didn't feel right,

 though I figured I would get used to it and come up the learning curve.

  They were discounting Teslas, down to $36k.  I liked the idea of the heat pump in

the Model 3's battery.

  Surprisingly, a Chevy Bolt was the same price $36k price.  Despite good reviews in

Consumer Reports and a fun Bolt test drive, my wife called it a clown car.  Overpriced

 for what it is.

  I was offered a Leaf SV Plus for $32k.  It was around half way between the body size

of a Bolt to Model 3.

  One concern with the Bolt and Leaf is that Tesla is opening up its connector and

charging circuit parameters to other auto makers to jump on board and use as a standard.

  This for many would make the Leaf and Bolt obsolete from day one.  However, I am 

charging at home exclusively.

  So I will be the first to admit that the Leaf does not look as good as a Model 3.

Having a non standard charging connector (future situation) that is non Tesla will

hit negatively on its resale value.

  However, as much as I could see how many are enamored with the Tesla autos, I

just was unable to get past the possibility that I could feel like a fool down the

road when a repair is needed, and face very long wait times and very high prices that

one invariably sees when the situation is closed, exclusive, and a little monopolistic.

  ""I bought an $80,000 brick"" commented one Tesla owner online.  Another: ""they are

disposable cars"".   I know things will get better with repairing Teslas in the future,

 but I had to go with present conditions.

  I bought a new Nissan Leaf SV Plus for $32k.  I am happy with it so far.  We'll see."

Be kind to new EV owners
This weekend I made a stop at an EA station in Flagstaff AZ to charge after seeing my daughter who goes to college at NAU. I drive a 2023 EV6 and have been an EV enthusiast for years so I know that if I want the most efficient charging experience I should use the 350kw units. As I pulled in I see a beautiful 2023 BMW iX on the 150 unit with the chademo plug with the hypercharger stalls open. I pulled into my 350 and (surprise) charged on 1st attempt at full max speeds. 

The woman in the iX was on the phone and appeared very frustrated. She then got in her car and moved to the 350 next to me. She then tried multiple times to get it to work, using her app, her credit card, and eventually broke down in tears because she couldn't figure it out. Her husband has been on the phone and was yelling at her because she couldn't figure it out. I stepped over and offered to help her out. She was flustered but agreed to let me try to help her. I had her unplug and reset her EA app. Within 5 minutes I had her charging. She was essentially doing things in the wrong order and the station was timing out every time. She had been trying to charge for over 30 minutes, had trued all the stalls and couldn't figure it out.

I bring this all up to remind the folks in this sub that we need to be the facilitators of change and help anyone we see having issues getting their cars to charge. Many of the new EV owners don't really know what they're doing, and having a negative experience on their 1st charging session not at home can impact their longterm views on EVs. Be kind and help these folks whenever possible."

I recently upgraded from a 2018 Model 3 to a 2023 Model Y. My thoughts on 5 years of Tesla ownership...
So when Tesla dropped their prices on the Model Y *and* it qualified for the tax credit again, I figured it was finally time to replace my Model 3. I'd had about 4.5 good years with it, but a bunch of little things were starting to get on my nerves enough that I felt like an upgrade was in order.

1. Degradation hadn't been bad by any means, but it hadn't been nothing. The battery was down to 292 miles of rated range from the initial 310 my LR RWD Model 3 started with (~6% degradation in 4.5 years). It was supposed to get an upgrade to 325 a few months after I got it, but it never did. Getting a Model Y would mean I'd get another 40 miles of range, since the Y gets 330 when new.
2. My Model 3's efficiency had absolutely gone to shit in recent months. When it was new, I'd regularly get between 200 and 240 Wh/mi on my commute in good weather (depending on traffic), but even in good weather I was regularly getting well over 300 Wh/mi since mid-2022. I think that was a result of using Michelin CrossClimate2 tires, and possibly other factors.
3. I had to bring this car in for a lot of service. The final count of unscheduled mobile service and service center visits was over 10, though one of those was because some ground squirrels that had been infesting my parents' property ate some of my wires... That was an expensive repair, but the rest of the unscheduled service visits were free.
4. The motor's inverter failed back in April 2022, and my car was stranded in the unusually low-roofed parking structure where it happened until the next morning, due to Teslas needing to be towed on flatbeds. Once the car eventually got towed to a service center, they took three weeks to get a replacement inverter installed. It would have been two weeks, except that their first replacement also failed, so they had to wait for another. The car ran flawlessly after that, though.
5. Being a 2018, this Model 3 was missing a lot of the QoL features of modern Teslas. Power trunk, USB-C ports, longer range, better build quality and double-laminated windows (and thus less *wind noise*), improved center console, and a few others.
6. I *hated* the red turn signals on my Model 3 so much that I spent a pretty penny replacing them with aftermarket tail light fixtures that included amber signals. Model Ys have amber turn signals from the factory, and I think modern Model 3s do, too.
7. The wind noise in my 2018 was bad. Like, *real bad*. I'd have to run my podcasts much louder than I liked, just to drown it out. The 2023 Model Y that I test drove was a radically better auditory experience, which is a major factor is making me decide to actually buy one.
8. Rattles. I had one pop up early in the driver-side seatbelt fixture (and thus *right* next to my ear). I fixed it myself, but my fix broke some of the trim connectors for the B-pillar, and that trim piece started rattling a while later. I even brought the car in to Tesla to have them fix that, and they simply failed to do so. The tech told me that such broken connectors were a known-to-be-unfixable problem in early Model 3s. There was also a rattle somewhere up front, possibly in the HVAC system, that absolutely refused to replicate when I'd bring the car in to a service center for them to fix it. This happened three times.

I'd already tried out the EV6, Ioniq 5, and Mach-E last year, when my Model 3 was in the shop for its inverter replacement, and found them all lacking. *Especially* in terms of software, and specifically navigation. None of them wow'd me at all, and none of the other EV offerings available in the US are appealing or within my budget (I'd probably love a Taycan, lol). So to me, ""upgrade"" meant ""new Tesla"", because I have no intention of going back to ICE.

Reasons to buy that I wrote down before making my decision:

* New HOV lane stickers that will last until Jan 2027. My Model 3's stickers just expired.
* 40 miles more range.
* Refreshed warranty.
* Much less wind noise.
* No rattles.
* Power liftgate and much more storage space.
* Improved build quality and newer components (e.g. higher resolution cameras and heat pump).
* New center console design with no piano black.
* New door open buttons which are much clearer for unfamiliar users, due to having a lit ""open door"" icon on them, instead of just a small white line.
* Higher ride height makes it easier to get in and out. Especially important for my aging parents, but quite a nice change for myself, too. 
* Redesigned rear seats that look more comfortable.
* White interior, which includes a white dashboard accent, rather than the wood one in my Model 3 that I don't really like.
* Better for car-camping, largely due to hatch vs. trunk.
* Compatible with the Tesla CCS adapter, which my old Model 3 is not. There's supposed to be a retrofit ""coming soon"", but it's still not available at time of writing.

Reasons not to get a Y:

* Not willing to spring for EAP or FSD, so I'll lose access to auto lane-change and Summon. My Model 3 has FSD, but I don't use the other features.
* Cost. I'll have about a $600/mo car payment again for either the next 4 or 5 years, depending on tax credit.
* Lack of ultrasonic sensors. Supposedly the software-based replacement that uses the cameras for the same purpose is very nearly ready.
* The higher ride height does come at a cost: I cannot see the front of the hood *at all* while seated in the Model Y's driver seat. This makes the lack of USS even more of a potentially serious problem.
* The Y is slightly wider, which will make the lack of Summon that much more of an annoyance due to my cramped carport.
* Tires will likely be more expensive, since the smallest rims available for the Y are 19s, while my Model 3 has 18s. Hopefully the Y's tires won't wear out nearly as fast as my 3's first two sets did (only 20,000 miles each).


I weighed these reasons for a few weeks, and eventually ordered a new Model Y in late January. It was ultimately delivered on March 18th, after I chose to change the color, which pushed delivery back a bit. So I've had my new Model Y for a month, and here are my thoughts:

Model Y Pros:

* Dramatically quieter at freeway speeds, both in terms of wind noise and road noise.
* Powered hatchback is a really nice feature. Never had one before. Not having to *lift* heavy objects in order to get them out the back of the car is super nice.
* Significantly deeper under-trunk storage and side-pockets compared to Model 3.
* I like the updated ""mouse wheels"" on the steering wheels. They have a much more premium feel than the ones on my 2018 Model 3. I rented a 2022 Model 3 for a few days that had the same mouse wheels, so they seem to be standard, now.
* Perfect panel gaps, as far as I could tell after a thorough inspection. This was a Fremont-built Model Y.
* Love the factory chrome delete. Works quite well with the red paint.
* I like having the pedestrian warning sound, which my 2018 Model 3 was too old to have, as it had no exterior speaker.
* I like the higher ride height a lot. Makes it much easier to get in and out of the car, as well as giving a more commanding view of the road.
* The headlights feel better.
* Zero initial quality issues. I brought my Model 3 in for warranty fixes a few times in its first several months of ownership. Things like loose plastic on the gearshift, a wonky mirror motor, and a mildly broken passenger door handle. My Model Y has had absolutely none of that.
* I love the white interior. It really makes the seats POP, and I prefer it over the wood dash trim, too. If it had been offered when I got my Model 3, I would have gotten it then, but they introduced the white a few weeks after my car was delivered. 
* Autopilot is still just as solid in my Y as it was in my 3. I get phantom braking only once a twice a *year*, so it effectively doesn't exist for me. My sole complaint is that in stop-and-go-traffic, Vision-only AP seems a *tad* jerkier than radar-based AP felt back when my Model 3 still had that.


Model Y Cons:

* I thought the view out the back window was bad in the 3. It's *much* worse in the Y. Thankfully the backup camera is outstanding, and can be enabled while driving.
* The hood slopes more than the Model 3, making it harder to tell exactly where the front of the car is from in the driver seat.
* The lack of Summon makes parking at home a lot more annoying. 
* The lack of ultrasonic parking sensors makes having no Summon even more annoying when I'm parking at home. They did finally add camera-based Park Assist a week or so after I picked up the car, though. It seems to work reasonably well, but not quite as well as the USS-based feature in my Model 3 did.
* I miss letting the car handle next-lane traffic for me during a lane change, but I got used to manually re-enabling Autosteer afterward pretty quickly. 
* The seatbelt was a tad uncomfortable, so I got an adjuster clip off of Amazon, which works great.

Other thoughts:

With a new Model Y, I was finally able to get a CCS adapter (my old Model 3 didn't have the appropriate electronics) and try it out at a local Electrify America station. Or rather, two local EA stations, because the first one had a broken charger and was otherwise full due to having only 3 stalls. *Sigh...*

The second one worked fine, though I did get a Windows error message about the machine running out of memory. That didn't seem to affect the charging session, though.

Given all the complaints that non-Tesla owners have in regards to payment at DCFC stations, I was surprised by how easy it was. I plugged in, tapped my phone on the NFC reader, and it charged my default Apple Wallet credit card and started sending electrons within about 30 seconds. I got 130-140kW, and left the station after I got back from the bathroom in the mall where it was located. It cost $13 to charge about 40% of my Model Y's battery ($0.48/kWh).

That said, while I had a flawless experience at that station, a local Ioniq 5 owner did not. He got stuck with a 50 kW capped charger for a bit, and frustratedly moved to two different charge ports before finding one that gave him the full 150kW charge speed that the station was supposed to offer.

Amusingly, one of the electronics cabinets that was feeding this EA station had a big Tesla logo on it. Not sure what sort of device it was, though.

If you have any questions for me about my ownership experience with either the 3 or the Y, please feel free to ask!

EDIT: Since I've been asked a few times, I sold my Model 3 private party for $33,000 (65,000 miles), after Tesla low-balled me on the trade-in offer at $22,800. I used the proceeds from that sale as the down payment for the Y's loan, which I got for 4.75% APR for 5 years."

I'm worried the ""public"" charging network isn't always publicly available. Is it?
Hello.

My almost 20 year old gas guzzler recently broke down and while I'm waiting to hear back on what it'll cost to fix, I started looking at potentially getting an EV to replace it. I was initially excited but now I'm worried about the charging landscape now and in the future. I live in an apartment that isn't going to put chargers into the garage anytime soon, so I'd be entirely dependent on public charge stations. However I bike more than I drive so that didn't seem like a deal-breaker. Especially with the kind of range I'm seeing on the Bolt EV, if I had to ""fill up"" twice as often and it took a few hours each time, I could probably live with that. Looking at [https://www.plugshare.com](https://www.plugshare.com) it seems like there's chargers around me.

&#x200B;

But after looking into things more I was horrified to see videos like this [https://youtu.be/02jSvv3q-RA?t=11](https://youtu.be/02jSvv3q-RA?t=11) and this [https://youtu.be/W-oaVLRH-js?t=144](https://youtu.be/W-oaVLRH-js?t=144). I've happily been using Linux smartphones for many years and I don't expect to ever switch back to an Android or iPhone. I knew for the physical plug the Tesla chargers had a proprietary one (since there was no standard) and then everybody else settled on a common standard, but I never considered any charge station was forcing mandatory proprietary apps on people like I'm seeing in some videos. That'd be as absurd as a gas station that would kick you out unless you downloaded a special Android or iPhone app, right?

&#x200B;

I'm in California and I'm seeing articles like [https://www.nrdc.org/bio/miles-muller/california-moves-make-paying-ev-charging-easier](https://www.nrdc.org/bio/miles-muller/california-moves-make-paying-ev-charging-easier) which seem to imply this shouldn't be possible, but doesn't Tesla have chargers in California? It looks like ISO 15118-20 [https://www.switch-ev.com/blog/new-features-and-timeline-for-iso15118-20](https://www.switch-ev.com/blog/new-features-and-timeline-for-iso15118-20) might be a solution for all this but it doesn't seem like that's supported on any vehicles yet?

&#x200B;

So my question is, what's the actual state of things out there? Are these videos not representative, or would it be commonplace for me to drive to a ""public"" charge station with a wallet full of cash and credit cards of every magstripe, emv, contactless variety, and still not be able to put fuel into my car? Should I hold out a couple more years with my clunker until all this is sorted out on newer cars? Any insights from people both inside and outside California would be appreciated, thanks!

\-- edit --I see now the ""public"" title is a bit overly editorial. I was originally going to say something like ""I'm worried that public charging stations might not be  functionally/effectively available to me"", but I was worried that sounded like I was asking how often chargers break and stop functioning or what their effective charge rates were. I didn't want to make people read my whole  wall of text to see I wasn't asking the question they expected. All the titles I came up with felt confusing but I thought the public one was the least confusing.

And by ""absurd"" I meant to highlight the ""charge terminals worked like gas  terminals"" headspace I was in. That's where my perspective is coming from. I see that's not right so please do correct me and let me know in what ways that's not the case!"

L2 Home Charger Fix/Disposal/Replacement?
I have a Clipper Creek Charger (HCS-40P ) that I've had for about 9 years. The top of the J1772 adapter  has a top trigger that seems to get stuck inside the housing from time to time. Anyone who has one of these may notice that the casing has security hex screws. They don't want you messing about in there, probably with good reason. I'd asked about a fix with the manufacturer with this reply.

>It sounds like the locking lever may have worn out and broke inside. The best tip for making it work in keeping forward pressure on the button as you push down. This is more of a temporary solution as the inlet, or connector, could have some minor arcing occur if the proximity button isn’t being fully pressed down when disconnecting. I would recommend to start shopping for a new station and not use this one too much longer.

The reply is from a contracted EVSE company rep that Clipper Creek uses.This seems like a drastic solution for such a small part that may be broken inside. I'd not considered what disposal looks like for one of these things. Any thoughts on what to do next?

Will there ever be truly cheap electric car?
Firstly, let me introduce car experiences I have had till now so you can see my point and what can be considered real low-cost car mobility.

I have driving license for 10 years and out of those 10 years I have had my own car for about 7 years. First car I owned served me some 5 years after I bought it for 500 $ - I had it till it literary broke down. Second car I got for some 200 $ and served me for 2 years. Right now I am buying my 3rd car for some 300 $ and expect it to serve me either 2 or 4 years. I don't have definite list of money I spent for maintenance, but I had never done any repair more expensive than 200 $, let’s say I paid 2k $ for maintenance (including 2 sets of tires (200 $ each) and I guess 3 oil changes - some 40 $ each) + some 1k $ for insurance (the cheapest basic insurance available). So, for some 3700 $ I have had functional and useful car for some 7 years and around 60k km (don't drive much). Even if you count gas, it adds only some 5k $ more. Important note is that none of these expenses were higher than 500 $ at once - for years I never had more than 1k $ in my bank accounts at once.

When everybody talks about ""cheap electric cars"" they mention Bolt (some 20k $ in US) or Leaf (some 30k $ in Europe) or maybe some Spring (some 20k $ in Europe). Even if we are talking about used cars the cheapest options right now cost around 6k $ (and have questionable usefulness as only car you own).

As you can see right now there is no possibility to get even close to my expenses with electric car. Even used Leaf right now has the same upfront cost as was my TCO for 7 years and not nearly the same utility (I don't use car for commuting - for that I use public transport - only for longer journeys and transporting stuff).

What about future? Because of course, part of this is because 10 and more years back there wasn't enough evs sold so there is not enough of old evs on used market. 

The problem that I see even in the future is that for an ev to be useful as the only car you need some 30 kWh battery at minimum (and that is really minimum - some 200 km of range if the car is efficient, 40 kWh would be much better). Battery for home storage that big costs around 12k $ here. Therefore, any car that has such a battery is not competing only to other cars but to other uses of battery as well. Sure, there are some other expenses to use the car battery as home storage but even if we subtract 1/3 it is still 8k $ just for battery of (just) useful ranged car.

Even if the prices go down by half it is still 4k $ that is just cost of car battery. 2k $ is roughly where evs will have same TCO as ICE cars have in my case in an ideal scenario for evs - if the electricity will get back to more ""normal"" price (today price is around 50 cents, 2 years back it was around 15 cents) and if I would have access to home charging. If I am thinking of not having home charging (as I don't have right now) then the price has to be somewhere around 1k $.

Is there any way for electric cars to get its price below 2k $? Or below 1k $ so it is not more expensive even for people without home charging?"

What larger EUV are you looking forward to?
Ok. I’m an EV6 owner, Tesla fan, and probs getting the cyber truck in the next 5 or so years. I’m about as anti-tribal as a person can be. I’m team EV, 100%. 
Also in the market for a large EUV (7+ passengers), hence why I get so hot and bothered by these things buuuut;

I’m really diggin the new Volvo. I grew up with Volvos, and the ex90 is just doing it for me. Combo of new and futuristic and “if it ain’t broke don’t fix it.”  I do admit that all of my earlier Volvos died from electronic failures (some rather absurd and hysterical), so a pure electric Volvo does give me a bit o’ pause. 

Really excited for the EV9. Have loved (LOVED) my EV6 since the day I accidentally bought it. Would love to keep it in the fam. Kia has REALLY impressed me over the last decade, and they have a really clear and positive plan moving forward. 

Also interested in Fords new EV offerings. I’ve always liked the explorer, so I’m pumped for an EV equivalent. Although the like warm reception of the F150 lightning is a bit concerning. 

Anywho; what biggerish EV has your attention?  Any you are counting down the days for release?

Edit; I FORGOT RIVIAN!!!  Really pumped to see the R1S out and about. I think my wife would be all in on that one if we could see more of it."

Are there any archived newspapers from the first half of the 1900s of people protesting cars?
I'm trying to find anything that shows that people were against cars and argued that horses were still better. I basically want to show that people were against advancements in technology then just as the anti-ev folks are today. 

They were called, ""the devil wagons"" and many states formed laws against cars for many reasons. 

We all know that the early cars aren't very reliable as they leaked fluids, broke down, didn't have any safety features, tires made from natural rubber were expensive, etc. But things improved and travel primarily on horseback and buggy went the way of the dodo."

How quantifiably reliable are Nissan leads?
Everyone totes that EVs are super reliable compared to ICE, Nissan isn’t well known for building quality ICE anymore so is the leaf -because it’s an EV- a major step up? 

Looking for solid data not “my aunt owned one and it never broke down” and definitely not ”did you know they suffer battery degradation”, ideally I’m looking for insurance/warranty figures for miles driven without incident compared with an similar sized ICE from the same company. The Renault Zoe would be another interesting comparison (Renault also have a less that stellar history with ice reliably)

God damn auto correct, leaf’s"

Which used ev for weekend trips?
Hoping to get some advice on what electric cars to consider. My car broke down recently, and I thought this might be the right time to go for a used ev.

My general usage is weekend trips (250km one way f.e.) and as you can see range and fast charging is very important for me. 

I am still quite new into this so there are many things I am ignorant about. Feel free to correct me. Here are some of the lower end used cars in my area. Prices in chf

Renault zoe - usually 8-10k, various years, with battery leasing. I found what seems to be a good deal of 2015 for 10k with battery included, but the range (22kw) and small physical size (seating + storage) makes me hesitate.

E-golf - rare and too expensive for what it is. 

Kia soul ev - around 15k, various years. I read somewhere it uses chademo which is apparently slow charging?

Nissan leaf - reaching 20k, apparently supposed to look for 2018 as gen 2 is much better. Also chademo charging? I found a 2017 model for 15k, worth looking into? 

Bmw i3 - 2014-2016 models. 20k area too for 60ah to 94ah models. Range doesn't seem to be too high but apparently fun to drive? Also has fast charging. Anyways, also seems kind of small?

Kona, e-niro, id. 3 etc are 30k and beyond my budget.

Hope I'm not forgetting anything. But what are your thoughts and experiences? Do I have a good view of the current choices so far? What do you suggest for my usage of driving? Also about SOH of batteries, how to check this? Check if it can be charged to 100% or need a garage to do this?"

Owned a Lucid Air for 10 days...here are my thoughts
I'm no journalist or claim to be an expert at anything regarding cars, but rather want to share my experience as an owner including all the faults I've experienced driving and owning the Lucid Air.

I took delivery of my Dream Edition on Nov 14, have driven it almost every day since. I've put a little over 450 miles on it, doing only local driving i.e. streets and freeways but nothing long distance (over 50 miles one way).

Interior and drive - we all know this already, but the materials and feel of everything inside makes it a very unique driving experience compared to previous drivers and vehicles I've owned. I've never been much for styling in a car, I've always considered them to be machines to get me from point A to point B, but the Air makes me appreciate the little intricacies and details quite a bit more compared to previous vehicles. We've never owned quite as expensive a car as this, but we have had and driven our fair share of ""nice"" vehicles which include the following: Mercedes S55 AMG, Mercedes S500, BMW 740 iL, Porsche Cayenne S, Tesla Model S (older version), Tesla Model 3, Mercedes CLK Convertible, a good number of Lexus, Hondas, Toyotas... The Lucid is just different, the interior design is exactly what Derek or Peter talked about in their interview. It's a calming driving experience even in the hustle and bustle of driving in Los Angeles. The cabin, is not the quietest out there, but it's definitely been the quietest I've been in for an extended period of time, and it's great. Putting on your latest podcast or playlist you just lose yourself to the drive. The screens are not intrusive and once you get everything set up how you like you just drive.

The drive itself - When journalists talk about feeling the road and getting feedback, the Lucid excels in this regard. The suspension is planted and firm, but also soft and forgiving at the same time. You can feel the road, but you don't feel every bump, it's stiff but not jarring and in smooth mode is comfortable why not feeling like you are floating or disconnected. In Swift mode, the suspension tightens up a little, you get more feeling from the road, the steering tightens up but is still incredibly easy to maneuver. The turning radius is good, bordering on great for a car this size. The car doesn't ever feel like it is a full size sedan even though it is. The feel is like a smaller more nimble vehicle that never feels it's size or weight.

With all that out of the way, how is it to actually drive and live with daily? What issues do I have...not everything is rainbows and unicorns.

I knew being in the first iteration of a vehicle, there would be problems. It's inevitable and there is no such thing as a perfect car, perfect software, or a perfect experience. I don't understand why or how anyone would expect Lucid to get everything right, right away, but the amount of hatred and scrutiny I've seen is unbelievable. I have faith that Lucid will fix the issues, especially any issues with software as that is a fix that is doable OTA. I'll breakdown issues I've experienced and have tried to replicate below:

The most common error I have is with the parking camera and sensor system. As of right now, when entering the car, the bootup sequence takes around 30 seconds to fully load the UI and all accompanying systems. I believe this is due to the car being put into a sleep state to reduce battery drain while sitting parked or idle. When entering the car and before the car is able to fully load, engaging drive or reverse MAY cause the cameras to not load properly. I've had about a 60/40 split on it loading properly prior to full bootup sequence being complete. This is fixed by locking and unlocking the car, which I assume is a system reset.  To add to this, this only happens when I first start up the car in the morning, so after the car has been sitting idle for 8+ hours.  When using the car during the day, the normal startup sequence is closer to 5 seconds.  It seems to take longer the longer the car is not in use.

I've had issues with my Frunk opening from the key fob. It almost always gets stuck on the passenger side latch. A second opening sequence on the fob (which involves just holding down the button) will unlatch the frunk and open normally. Funnily enough, this does not happen when opening the Frunk from inside the car via the pilot panel. This issue has already been reported to Lucid.

Issues with my trunk. I've been able to replicate an issue where, IF the car is not unlocked and you try to open the trunk AFTER you unlock the vehicle, the power trunk will not operate and the trunk close button will not operate. A simple fix is to manually close the trunk, lock the car, unlock the car and it functions as normal again. The trunk close button also has come loose. A technician looked at it and the clip inside broke so that will be replaced the next service visit. There is a seal that has come loose, looks like there was some glue missing in that section and will need to be re-glued. I also took delivery with a blemish in the spoiler section of the trunk lid. The service center, prior to taking delivery, noted this in their file and have ordered a replacement lid because they felt the error could not be corrected via a paint job i.e. it was blemish in the underlying metal.

UI Issues or personal preferences that I feel should be changed. I'm not entirely sure if these issues are by design or some bug in the software, but these things I brought up with the Lucid team as things I would like to see changed:

You cannot have a separate panel loaded in the driver panel and the pilot panel at this time. If you choose maps, it will load maps on both, same goes with Music, or phone, or home. My preference is to be able to keep a map up in the driver panel and have the music or phone loaded on the pilot panel or any combination there of. Currently, because of the ability to ""swipe down"" the different options, it will only allow you to load one item as a time on both panels.

Currently, Homelink is tied to driver profiles. This could be a design choice due to future security implementations with driver profiles, but upon initial setup it surprised me. I only set up my driver profile with Homelink and have not bothered with the other drivers in the family because I did not want to have to go through the same steps 15 more times. I do like how Homelink is geo triggered, so when I pull into my driveway, it brings up the Homelink to select which gate to open.

The NAV audio volume is not adjustable or able to be turned off.

The turn signal audio is quite loud.

I've had some issues with bluetooth audio playback and the Spotify app loaded in the UI. There has been 2 occasions where the car got stuck in a loop trying to play Spotify via bluetooth off my phone or Spotify from the UI. It was corrected by just selecting am/fm radio and going back to the Spotify app. I'm not sure if it's adjustable or not, but the Spotify app in the car does not have an option to have ""random"" skipping during play from a playlist. It will just play in order of the playlist. The search function in the Spotify app is wonky. You can search but once the search returns results and you select something, it will just play that song or first song from the artist instead of letting you go into a sub menu for the artist.

When receiving a text message and using the car's AI to read it back, this will trigger the Spotify app to stop playing. In order to start playback again, I have to go back and select the app and hit play again.

The skip forward and skip back buttons on the steering wheel will skip to the next radio substation. Even after I have setup my favorite stations, my preference would be to skip to the next station on my list, however, as currently setup, it moves forward or back to the next substation.

Because ADAS is not currently enabled on the car, I can't properly review it yet, except I feel Lucid has missed an opportunity to map the left scroll wheel and left button for other functions besides ADAS functions.

The main pilot panel I feel can be improved. Initially, it's great to see the car and background change when you change drive modes, but I would LOVE for that screen real estate to be replaced with something else. My top 2 choices now are the ability to access NAV, music or phone from the pilot panel. A redundancy of being able to access menus would be great.

To address the apparent lagginess of the UI, I posted this response below and I should have included it in my main post:

I think that the screen works great. I've seen the videos where people say it appears laggy, but the way I look at it is that it's a design choice. I think instead of comparing the screen to a Tesla or Iphone, I would say it's more comparable to how in movies, transitions used are different. For example, a cut vs. a fade transition. I feel, though I could be wrong, that Lucid has purposely chosen some effects to be slower and feel more like a fade versus a cut to a new screen. Some functions are much snappier like when certain buttons are triggered whereas other seem to ""flow"" for lack of a better way to describe it. I guess you could say it's more gentle? It's hard to describe, but having used Tesla screens compared to this, it gives off the feeling of not being rushed and is more leisurely. I wouldn't call it lag because it's not choppy.

Overall though, this is really minor nit picky stuff. I've never felt these small issues have affected the quality of the drive or my experience. These can also all be corrected via software and are also personal preference. I understand my desires may not align with Lucid's design view, so in its current iteration, I would be happy with it, even if nothing changed.

I've shown many people the car, talked to many people about it when they come up asking and sitting inside and the comments are all the same. Every single commenter has said how much nicer the car is compared to Tesla, the details, the build quality, the interior. The highest praise I've gotten is when I took the car down to get a quote from a very well known and respected detail and wrap shop. I arrived to get a quote to wrap the car and get it tinted. They had just finished wrapping 2 Ferraris and had a Pagani on the floor. The owner came out and just said ""WOW"" that is a nice looking car. The sales associate with him got inside to look and said ""This is amazing, so much nicer than any Tesla."" Given this shop's track record and cars they've worked on, it's good to hear. 3 detailers who've seen the car up close have commented how the build quality and finish blew Tesla out of the water. One even said that this is the first EV he would consider buying because of the design aspect. I don't include these anecdotes to hate on Tesla, because I still like the cars, but this truly is the next iteration of the luxury EV.

Let me end by saying that the car is appropriately named. It really is the culmination of vision and hard work that have turned the dream into reality. The car is not perfect and I'm sure there will many iterations of software to come, but so far it has been a Dream."

Thinking of Selling Current Tesla and Purchasing Two EVs
First, we live in the San Francisco Bay area, so the weather is very temperate and we have strong tax incentives to buy new EVs.

We used to have two cars until our old ICE car broke down on a road trip this year. Now we're down to our Tesla Model 3, which is fine until I have to go back to commuting in January. We will need one car for a small commune and a SUV for more general use and roadtrips (we want 300+ mile range).

With the inflated value of used electric cars (and Tesla cars in particular), we're thinking of selling it and replacing it with two new EVs. Our Tesla is a 2019 Standard Range + Model 3 (230 mile range), <7k miles. The Tesla trade-in calculator values it at $35,700 (using VIN) and looking at [findmyelectric.com](https://findmyelectric.com) we might be able to get up to \~$39k.

We we originally thinking of just buying a Mustang Mach-E or Model Y to replace our ICE car. Looking at these prices though, we're thinking of selling our Model 3 (which is more than I need for a commuter car) and purchasing a smaller car like the Nissan Leaf. I've heard the Leaf has battery management issues. I figure since we live in a temperate climate (though it can get hot in August) and we will be using it very little in terms of mileage, it could work out well.

Our plan would be to try to get a base 2022 Nissan Leaf S (with $7.5k +$3.5k tax credits between federal and state), we should be able to get it for below $20k. Then, selling our Model 3 and finally purchasing a Mach-E (once we are able to).

Is this crazy? It's a weird situation to be in since we didn't expect to be selling our Model 3 ever, but prices are so inflated and it's not long range enough (or large enough) to use it for road trips. As is, getting two cars for more specialized purposes seems to make sense for us.

Does anyone have insight on how the tax credits work if we purchase two vehicles? Would we still qualify for the credit if we purchase both this year?"

Ideas?? My VVE (housing association) wants to reduce power in all garages to keep EVs from charging
Somewhat irritating, the power of homeowner associations. I bought an apartment with a garage box with 2 standard plugs of power running in there; one powers the garage door opener and a light. I don't use the other.

**Result!! Update below!**

The yearly VVE/homeowners meeting tonight carries [a small codicil tucked in the back ](https://i.imgur.com/WYZ8b7R.jpg)of 40 pages of double-sided financial documents: 

>	Explanation of the board agenda item 10: Disconnection of communal power consumption. 
>	
>	To prevent the charging of electric cars and other heavy power consumption, a quotation was requested at the last ALV (2020) at the request of the members, specifically about the cost of disconnecting the general power consumption from 16 to 6 amps. The costs are EUR 500. 
>	
>	The Board asks the members' approval for this amount.

First off, I've *never* charged in my garage - there are 11kW poles in front of my apartment, and it's 1/4 the price of gas. When I bought the place, I knew there's a limit to the power available to the garages because of insufficient wiring (**EDIT: I don't want to charge - that's not what I'm arguing for**). Also, my garage box door is only electrically operated - I have a small opener there, as there's no spring system in place (I bought it this way, 12 years ago), so if there's not enough power to open my door that will be an issue. 

They took the first steps in the pandemic when we couldn't gather, which is kind of sneaky. Also, this will impact the value of our apartments, basically advertising that theres a problem with power in the building area. This has been an issue for a while -- they need to fix the issue and not push it off onto others. Do they think this will just go away over time? 

Our home association is run like a little fiefdom, and they do what they want.  The garages have insulated ceiling tiles (1m x .5m x 10cm thick) that fall down - but it's our space, our responsibility. Same with the garage doors - mine broke recently, was told it was my domain  and my responsibility.  Electrical power is not a luxury; it's a utility.

They also say it's not fair that I can (hypothetically) charge a car when the other non-garage spaces can't. My apartment cost more because it came with a garage. Some apartments came with a terrace - mine doesn't. Should I have a right to say that people can't use their terraces because I don't have one and ""it's not fair""? This is *such* a stupid argument and I can't believe I'm even bothering with it, but here I am. Fuck. 

Sorry for the rant. 

Can anyone see a bargaining point in this? I need to go there tonight and argue in my pathetically bad dutch to have them not do this, and I could use other points of view on what rights I should expect to have that they can't take away.

**Edit:** Thanks for everyone's comments. I've got to get through the workday today and then off directly to the meeting. The codicil came as a shock and I overreacted a bit, but I appreciate the temperate comments in return.

**Eddit:** I added emphasis on the charging issue - I don't expect to charge, but I expect to be able to use my opener (which seems likely) and there should be discussions NOW about upgrading the wiring in the next few years, to maintain the value of our property.

**Final Edddit:** Went to the VVE meeting. I should mention there's the people of the VVE in there but it's chaired by a non-aligned, external (legal) person. 

As expected, I was last and everyone was chatting about leaving and getting coffees and the usual ""I've-had-about-enough-now"" chit-chat. I told them I generally agreed, but wanted to 1) make sure all that works now (garage doors, lights) continues to work, and 2) that we make a plan for next year's gathering for updating the garage wiring for the future. 

A few of the younger people in the group (30s) also expressed interest in getting EVs or electric scooters. Most of the older folks (70+) kept chatting amongst themselves while I explained the adoption rate in the Netherlands (likely at least 40% this year), the upcoming climate goals, etc. Then I mentioned that there was a law moving through government that make the VVE responsible for charging. They got quieter. Then I mentioned that this new right means it likely would impact the value the apartments, for sellers and renters. Dead quiet - I finally got their entire attention (mental note - next time, appeal to wallets first).

One VVE member began to deny it and object, but then the chair then stepped in and said he was aware of it, that I was correct and that we would indeed need to update the electrical system. Not chaos, but there were a lot of questions about how quickly it will come (he suggested within the year), about things they've heard about EVs and fire and all. I explained charging but it was clear we'd need to do this differently, so I offered to explain anything on EVs and charging to anyone if they'd like. Coffee, included. I also offered to help with any scheme to upgrade and make meter-able the use of the general electric supply (/u/luukje999 👍). 

We're on our way to a solution! Thank you again to all who helped me gather thoughts and arguments!"

Could you help me choose between Volvo XC40 P8 and VW ID4
Last week my Volvo V60 Diesel broke down and it was the final straw. With fuel prices going up I was surprised to find that EV's are actually the more interesting option for me at the moment.

I had a shortlist of Polestar 2, Volvo XC40 P8 recharge and the VW ID4. Last week I tested the XC40 and I absolutely loved it. Yesterday I tested the Polestar and to me it lost to the XC40, because of its interior. My partner and I are both very tall and the Polestar just feels a bit too compact.

After this weekend I'm testing the ID4, but already I am leaning towards the XC40. The only thing the ID4 has over the XC40 is that it's the cheaper option of the two. So now I'm stuck between the choice of going for an absolutely lovely car that's on the expensive side or a decent car that's a bit more affordable.

So my question to you: have you considered these cars and what were things to keep in mind while making my choice?

Thanks!"

Will we see good finance deals again? Or is demand outstripping supply?
So, my wife and I have been looking at getting another EV.

We used to have a LEAF 24 Tekna (top spec, I think they call it different names elsewhere in the world for some reason). the 2 year PCP finance (£189 per month) ended with a GFV of £15k, we laughed and said ""take it"", because you could get the same car we just had used for about £7k. Our car that we used for towing broke and was not worth fixing, and not having the £100k for the Model X, we decided on a used Outlander PHEV so that at least one of our commutes was covered under electric, and we could still tow.

We are now looking for another EV to replace our 2nd car (an old diesel estate). Thinking it'd be easy, I started to call around dealers, and get some rough information about pricing, finance, etc...

Seemingly, a lot has changed! I put it down to a combination of lack of supply and larger batteries increasing the cost.  Perhaps part of it was also Nissan being aggressive with their finance - I guess there is no better advertising than loads of people driving them around!

The same spec LEAF that we had, but with the 40kWh battery would be £330ish per month (that's with a £5k deposit, so likely more per month). That being said, we were reluctant to look into it too much, as we figured with the 60kWh pack coming out soon, maybe the price might drop, or perhaps the 60 pack not be too much more - I always say ""if you wait for the next big thing, you'll always be waiting"", but it just seems so close (no idea if it actually is).

We got to looking at some of the other EVs available, and it turns out we are very picky! We looked at the Kona, but the awful plastic arches put us off, plus it has a 42 week wait. I really want to like the eNiro, but, like the Kona, no remote climate control - and we use that feature almost every trip. I could have the i3, but the wife doesn't like the look of it. We both like the Ioniq, but Hyundai, at least near us, really aren't interested in them (was willing to overlook that for the Kona). The Soul EV just doesn't have the range - we are looking for 150 real world miles. We looked at the Zoe, and actually managed to get haggle a reasonable price for it, under £19k - also, my wife found out that it comes in purple...

We did look into used EVs, but none of them really have the range we are looking for, understandable though. A lot of the 30kWh LEAFs for sale used are nearly the price of a new ZOE - crazy!

Don't get me wrong, I'd happily have a Tesla, but we will likely be priced out of a new one forever, used... Found some Model S for about £37k, even looked at finance quotes, but at £600 a month it's... it's not that we couldn't afford it, it's just difficult to justify spending that much a month on a box - even if it is very clever - don't reply to me about this bit, it's really not going to be difficult to twist my arm into doing it!

&#x200B;

The old diesel estate will be uneconomical to repair when it has it's MOT. The two most realistic options are probably to replace it with another ICE - we just want to try and move forward, rather than backward, so with that in mind, maybe the Zoe?

&#x200B;

So, my limited research has shown me that perhaps the days of the cheaper finance offers has ended? Has anyone found the same? Are there any other cars that we should look into that aren't on our list? Has anyone got any of those cars with a good deal that wouldn't mind sharing the details - would really help us out with our spreadsheet!"

Does anyone know a good website for electric cars comparison?
Hi, everyone!I have finally decided to go all-electric. Better late than never, you know.Previously I owned a few gasoline-powered cars, but after my current car broke down the second time this month I realized that I'm done with visiting a mechanic's garage. However, let's cut to the chase.

Right now I'm looking for the perfect electric car for me. And to my surprise, the US EV market is much bigger than I thought.So the question is: **Can you recommend a dedicated website to compare different electric cars (specs, trims...) and check offers and availability?**

The majority of the sites I've found are just car-selling platforms not focused on EVs. And I'd like to find an EV database of some kind. It should be easy to use for non-tech people like me and contain FAQs and EV-specific info like charging ports and standards, range on one charge e.t.c"

Cheapest electric vehicle that can reliably transport me 30 miles a day. During the night as well!
30 mile commute in total to work and back, decent hills, top it off I work late hours so it will always be dark at least 1 way sometimes  during certain times of the year when I start and end my shift it will be dark.

So my expectations are super high for this, I mean I need cheap, like the cheaper the better. So I am putting my expectations high to see what is suggested.

Id take suggestions like electric bicycles, but I dont think anyone wants to ride a bike 20 or 30 miles up and down hills in almost freezing tempatures. But I am also pretty broke, I don't want to put a number on it because my number would scare away potential answers. So just give me the dirt cheap economical choices. The absolute cheapest of the cheap. that is at least road capable of getting me 30 miles and at least capable of riding the back roads if not the freeway.

Thanks for your time!"

Soaring electric truck sales deal new blow to diesel use in China (Reuters)
LANGFANG, China, July 11 (Reuters) - Electric-powered heavy trucks are rapidly gaining market share in China, driven by subsidies and the quick rollout of chargers, further curbing diesel usage and denting oil demand from the world's biggest crude importer.

The boom in electric truck sales in China follows that of electric cars and the rise in recent years of LNG-powered heavy trucks. Those factors, combined with slowing economic growth, have stifled its oil consumption growth.

Sales in the world's biggest market for new energy trucks are estimated to have risen 175% year-on-year to 76,100 in the first half of this year, or about a quarter of new truck sales, according to consulting firm Sublime China Information (SCI). Electric models, still mostly used for short-haul runs in ports, mines or steel mills, accounted for over 90% of that increase.

The rapid pace has surprised analysts who have revised down diesel demand forecasts as a result and brought forward their predictions for a [peak in Chinese oil demand](https://www.reuters.com/markets/commodities/after-decades-china-sputters-engine-global-oil-demand-growth-2024-12-03/).

SCI's analyst Xu Lei said he cut the firm's China diesel demand expectations by 1%-2% given the boom in electric truck sales.""

The surge in electric heavy trucks was a surprise and has become a new factor accelerating China’s oil consumption to peak, most likely this year,"" said Ye Lin, vice president at Rystad Energy, who had previously expected a 2026 peak.

The transport sector, which burns about two-thirds of all diesel in China, will use 40% less by 2030, cutting overall diesel consumption by about a quarter compared to 2024 levels, according to Rystad.

Diesel consumption this year is forecast to fall by 11.3 million tons, or 6.3%, on par with last year's drop, according to SCI.

# 'BEIJING TO YUNNAN'

After more than six years behind the wheel of a diesel truck, Li Shuai, who drives for a cement plant in Hebei province near Beijing, switched to an electric truck six months ago.

""Charging infrastructure has improved noticeably in the past half year, making things much more convenient,” Li, 38, said. ""It is even possible to drive an empty truck more than 2,000 km from Beijing to Yunnan to pick up goods without worry.""

The rapid buildup of charging infrastructure, primarily through industrial corridors, is underpinning adoption, although charge times that can stretch to 90 minutes and limited charger availability in some areas remain issues.

Teld, an EV charging infrastructure provider that has built more than 2,400 truck charging stations across China, officially opened an 800 km corridor in March linking Shanxi and Shandong provinces, a key route through the country’s coal-producing region.

At a charging station next to the Hebei cement plant, car and truck chargers sit side by side in the dusty lot. Owner Yongji Liu had originally only planned to service EVs but said ""the electric truck market is growing so fast that we also installed chargers for trucks"".

# CHEAPER THAN ALTERNATIVES

The booming market for electric trucks is partly due to cheap electricity and government subsidies introduced last July of up to 95,000 yuan ($13,264) for new vehicles, analysts and truckmakers said.

While diesel trucks are cheaper upfront, higher fuel costs make them more expensive after a million kilometers of driving.

Once fuel is included, diesel trucks cost about 2.25 million yuan ($314,000) at the million-kilometer mark, roughly 10% more than LNG trucks and 15% more than electric trucks, according to GL Consulting.

Rising fuel costs have also eroded some of the price advantage enjoyed by LNG trucks, which along with limited refueling stations in some regions, have hindered their growth, said SCI analyst Wang Neng.

SCI forecasts LNG truck sales to hit around 92,000 units in the first half, down 15% from a year earlier, although the surge in electric adoption is more than offsetting the impact on diesel consumption.

China's second-best-selling electric truck maker Sany (600031.SS), opens new tab says the growth potential for electric trucks is greater than for passenger EVs because lower operating costs bolster the profitability of corporate users.

""We expect electric heavy trucks to account for 70% to 80% of new sales within as little as two to three years, driven by lower operating costs and more comprehensive charging infrastructure,"" said Zhaoting Yue, SANY's vice president of international marketing.

My pathetic experience in using Electric two wheeler Ozotec Flio
I've been using Flio electric two wheeler for past four years and drove 40000 kms. My experience is below:

1 st year - 

Everything looks GREEN and great. No fuel expense, no walking, proper service response. Range 100 kms.

2 nd year - 

Small issues like indicator not working, horn switch damages raised. Still happy as it also happens in other vehicles. Range 100 kms.

3 rd year - 

Range dropped to 60 kms and I reached service and was excited to see them taking back the battery and sending it to company. They convinced that its repaired after 30 days and fitted. The very next ride I got the same 60 kms range. It was very clear that they have not sent my battery anywhere. I kept using it despites my complaints were unheard.

The same year its controller and charger gone. Wasted 6000 + 6000 rs and got new ones.

4 th year - 

50 kms range and still rolling with lot of frustration. THIS WILL BE MY LAST ELECTRIC VEHICLE.

At this time I'm starting to notice the same feedbacks I had in 2nd year with my friend's Chetak and Ather vehicles. Lets wait for their experiences next year.

Below is frustration in Tamil:

வயிறு எரிஞ்சி சொல்றேன். 

இந்த (Flio, Bheem) வாகனத்தை வாங்காதீங்க. இது குப்பை. அவங்க warranty போலி. அவங்ககிட்ட எந்த spare parts-um இல்ல. பிரேக் ஸ்பேர்ஸ் கூட இல்ல. 

இத வாங்கினாள், 1 லட்சம் நாமம் நிச்சயம்."

Atto 3 2025 battery range issues
I got a BYD Atto 3 Standard 2025 model earlier this year and have been happy with all aspects apart from the battery life.

I wanted to figure out if there's an issue with my battery in particular or if this is pretty normal for the Atto 3 or EVs in general. I fully charged the battery before my trip (410km range) reset the odometer for trip A and started driving from Sydney to Canberra roughly 300km distance. I understand that freeway driving (110km/hour) uses more energy than city driving but was still disappointed by the result. After 190km of my trip I had already used 78% of my battery and definitely would not make it all the way to Canberra on a full charge.

I'm interested to know if others have a similar experience with their EVs or if I have an issue that I should get BYD to look at."

Learning to drive an ev.
I love my 2023 Volvo C40. No complaints, only praise for the car. My concern is with the dealership. While driving this 400+ horsepower vehicle is thrilling and satisfying, it is a very different driving experience than my 10 year-old Jeep Cherokee. When they turned over the keys, there was very little instruction about my new vehicle. There have been so many nuances that I had to learn from Redditors, trial and error, friends experiences  or by swinging by the dealership because something is happening I've never seen before. I'm still learning that if you push these two buttons for 40 seconds, it fixes some issue.

Shouldn't the salesman/dealership offer more training before I drive it off the lot? It can be a steep learning curve when you buy your first ev. Driving a computer is very different than driving an ICE vehicle. Does anyone feel they knew all about their new ev when they drove away the first time?"

Are Our Homes and Offices Falling Behind in the EV Transition?
As more people switch to electric vehicles, there’s growing concern about whether our built environment is ready for what’s next. A recent peer-reviewed article published in the Journal of Building Engineering takes a deep dive into this issue—and the findings are eye-opening.

The article, titled “A Systematic Review of Literature on Electric Vehicle Ready Buildings”, was authored by Isaac Akomea-Frimpong et al. It reviews the current state of EV readiness in residential and commercial buildings and outlines what needs to change to make everyday charging more accessible.

Here are some key takeaways from the study:

🔹 Most buildings are not EV-ready.
From apartments to office towers, most lack the wiring, infrastructure, or planning to support EV chargers—even in countries with strong EV uptake.

🔹 People want to charge at home or work—but can’t.
Home and workplace charging is in high demand, yet current policies still focus on public chargers, leaving everyday needs underserved.

🔹 Retrofitting buildings is expensive and complex.
Installing chargers in existing properties involves major electrical work, and costs often fall on private owners or tenants.

🔹 There’s a major data gap.
No clear data exists on how many buildings currently support EV charging, or how charging patterns vary by property type. This lack of information hampers policy and planning.

🔹 Building codes are behind.
Few jurisdictions require new buildings to be EV-ready. Even fewer offer practical guidance or incentives for retrofitting existing structures.

🔹 Construction professionals lack training.
Many builders and electricians are not yet equipped with the knowledge to design or install EV-ready infrastructure.

🔹 Consumer safety and privacy need stronger protection.
As smart chargers become more connected, so do risks around electrical safety and personal data.

🔹 More research is urgently needed.
Especially around funding models, user experiences, and how EV infrastructure interacts with smart buildings and energy systems.

I've tried to use ABRP but it keeps saying no valid plan no matter how I try to segment it, is there a better way to plan? I've also considered just using Google maps and relying on my portable charger anytime I can't get to a charging station, but I don't know how reliable that is.

Could the Clean Vehicle Credit have been keeping EV prices artificially inflated?
Disclaimer: I write this as someone who happily took advantage of the EV tax credit via the ""lease loophole"".

As I was trying to understand some details of the bill that was just rammed through congress, I ended up actually reading some of the original IRA, specifically this section: SEC. 13403. QUALIFIED COMMERCIAL CLEAN VEHICLES. 

(b) PER VEHICLE AMOUNT.—

  (1) IN GENERAL.—Subject to paragraph (4), the amount determined under this subsection with respect to any qualified commercial clean vehicle shall be equal to the lesser of—

(A) 15 percent of the basis of such vehicle (30 percent in the case of a vehicle not powered by a gasoline or diesel internal combustion engine)

, or

(B) the incremental cost of such vehicle.  

  (2) INCREMENTAL COST.—For purposes of paragraph (1)(B),the incremental cost of any qualified commercial clean vehicle is an amount equal to the excess of the purchase price for such vehicle over such price of a comparable vehicle.

  (3) COMPARABLE VEHICLE.—For purposes of this sub-section, the term ‘comparable vehicle’ means, with respect to any qualified commercial clean vehicle, any vehicle which is powered solely by a gasoline or diesel internal combustion engine and which is comparable in size and use to such vehicle.

  (4) LIMITATION.—The amount determined under this sub-section with respect to any qualified commercial clean vehicle shall not exceed—

(A) in the case of a vehicle which has a gross vehicle weight rating of less than 14,000 pounds, $7,500, and

(B) in the case of a vehicle not described in subparagraph (A), $40,000.



The ""Incremental Cost"" part caught my attention. One could argue that this incentivizes EV manufacturers to ensure that the price of a given EV is at least $7500 more than a comparable ICE car. As battery costs have been coming down, have the car prices stayed artificially high because of the ""free"" $7500 for the car companies in the US? (I am open to the possibility that an analysis of prices in other countries could blow some holes in this theory, though some of them may have similar incentives.)

The IRS put out guidance related to Incremental Cost and their analysis resulted in them basically saying, everyone gets the $7500 because the incremental cost is always more than that for BEVs. [https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-issues-guidance-on-the-incremental-cost-for-the-commercial-clean-vehicle-credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/irs-issues-guidance-on-the-incremental-cost-for-the-commercial-clean-vehicle-credit)"

Chicagoland EV drivers without home charging
Lawmakers in Illinois are considering a public charging tax of 3 cents per kWh to help pay for transit funding. It is not projected to generate more than a couple million out of a $1 BILLION+ budget. The potential impact on those who rely on public charging, who tend to be lower-income, renters, etc., is obviously not worth whatever revenue it could generate.

I’m looking for people who live in specific IL House Districts who rely on public charging and are interested in talking to their rep about this issue. You can look up your IL House District here: https://www.illinoispolicy.org/maps/illinois-house/

Rep. Eva-Dina Delgado (3rd District, northwest side) is leading efforts to fix and fund transit and needs to hear from constituents why this particular policy would hurt more than help. Other legislator targets are Rep. Kam Buckner (26th District, south side) and Speaker Welch (7th District, western suburbs).

If you live in these districts and want to help fight this, please DM me for more info!!!

The main arguments against this tax:
-It harms those who already do not have equitable access to charging, i.e., affordable and convenient home charging
-Public fast charging costs much more than residential electricity rates. Any increase to its costs directly affects potential EV savings and disincentivizes EV adoption
-Although EVs are present in every single neighborhood of Chicago, many areas on the South, West, and far Northwest sides are charging deserts without ANY public charging, further exacerbating inequitable access to charging
-IL EV owners already pay an extra registration fee and pay taxes on the electricity we consume
-The only other states to implement such a tax are anti-EV Republican states
-This state policy would hurt current EV owners, discourage potential future owners, and slow EV adoption at a time when federal policy is aggressively attacking EVs

800 Mile Road trip in an EV, the good, the bad, and the ugly
My husband has had an EV for 3 years now, and I just recently converted, myself, with a Ford F-150 Lightning. 

We just took our first long road trip in the truck, and on our way back, forgot the lessons we first learned on our first trip with his VW ID.4 (which was replaced with the BMW iX after an unfortunate run-in with a deer.) 

TL;DR: For long road trips, Avoid stretches with just a single fast charging network to choose from, and plan your route around areas with multiple options. Electrify America seems to be drastically throttling, maybe due to the heat, so avoid them if you can, and never ever put yourself in a position to rely on them. Always check your ABRP route against the actual network app, to make sure your route has functional charges. 

The long: 

I-95, Virginia to Florida and Back, a trip we have made a number of times in an EV, has taught us many lessons. One wrong decision can create a cascade of events that adds hours to your trip. Ask me how I know, lol. 

So our first rule of the road trip: NEVER EVER include the Walterboro, SC Electrify America charger in your trip. Just trust me on this. It isn't worth it. We have never gotten a decent charge there. We feel lucky if we can get the 75kw, but that is usually after waiting and jockeying for the one charger that might give it. I forgot this important rule, and yikes, it was an epic mistake. 

""A Better Route Planner"" is cool, but could be better. The chief issue: It includes chargers that have been down long term. FPL Evolution has 2 charging stations near Palm Coast, and both are down along a fairly long stretch. Unfortunately, unwisely, we tried the first one before checking the evolution app itself, and realizing they were down. 

We tried, for the first time, shorter charges because we were trying to make it to a certain city before a certain time, and it did NOT work out in our favor. It just doesn't work out when every EA charger along your route is throttled. 

In total, our trip home, which included 3 Electrify America stops, ended up taking 3 additional hours longer than our trip down, when we didn't use EA. In the same truck. :/  

If you happen to make this same trip, on our way down, we stopped at Buccee's in Florence, SC which has very fast chargers. (And clean bathrooms. Their commitment to styrofoam is annoying, though, so BYOCup.)  We then made it to Richmond Hill, GA, where we got a great fast charge at the TA Travel Center. Down to FPL Evolution in Yulee, which is super nice because there is a Wawa next door and it is only 30c. Besides Palm Coast, the FPL fast chargers have been nice and consistent. Just check the app for faults, and pick the fast speeds. 

On the trip down, started with 90%. Arrived at destination with 80%. (No home charger at destination) Charged for 3.5 hours over that 800 miles, plugged in 6 times. 

On the trip back, we plugged in 13 times. Charged for 5 hours. (Not including waiting and moving spots, which ate a ton of time.) Started at 90%. Arrived home with just 15%, three hours later than planned. 

  
The trip down seemed like a breeze. The 30-40 minutes charges don't bother me at all when we only have to stop every couple of hours. I am a macro photographer, so I just get out and look for bugs to shoot. The trip home was absolutely brutal and stressful. We should have repeated our route down, but my husband didn't want to charge over 80% due to ""throttling."" Ha. Jokes on him. Turns out the entire second half of our trip was throttled, despite rolling up with 15% each time. :/

Cadillac Lyriq Lemon law
do not buy cadillac ev. 
My Cadillac Lyriq takes about 10 minutes to shift into reverse during rainy weather, and it applies a sudden, forceful brake that scares my child and sometimes makes him cry while sitting in the car. At times, it also takes a long time to pull out of a parking space, which makes people think I don’t know how to drive—when in fact, this is a known issue with the Lyriq.
We paid $60,000 for this vehicle, and its safety features are not functioning as they should. The dealer and GM have told us that this issue cannot be fixed and that we’ll need to drive the car with the safety features disabled.
Given the amount we’ve paid for this vehicle, shouldn’t the dealer have informed us earlier about this known issue, especially after we’ve taken the car back to them multiple times?
Now we’re wondering: should we consider filing a Lemon Law claim for this vehicle?

Charging with debit card?
Hi, 
I will be driving from Belgium to the Netherlands soon, and I was wondering how feasible it is to use different apps connected only to a debit card to travel. My dad said I might encounter issues because I don't have a credit card- is this correct?

I have been looking around applications, and I see there are ""reservation"" fees on credit cards and subscription based charging cards. What would you recommend? 

We have the Kia EV6 and will need to charge once during the drive (at a Fastned probably), and then a few times during the week for some drives in the Netherlands itself.

I've checked out plugsurfing, fastned, ionity, and ABRP- and I must admit it seems a bit confusing. 

Any tips or info would be super appreciated.

Car EV rental experience with Sixt
Hi all, I was looking for some information regarding this very topic a few weeks ago before I embarked upon the rental of an EV with Sixt. Thought I’d share our recent experience.

I rented a Tesla Model Y for 5 days from / to Brisbane airport. I found any rental site out of the airport (in the city area) to have less and more expensive car options. I like how EVs drive, so I picked that; but there were many options to choose from at the airport station.

Some details of my rental:
Travelled as a group of 4 from Brisbane airport to Gold coast and Byron Bay, then back. 

Originally booked a BYD ATTO 3 but changed it to a Tesla Model Y at the last minute as I found it much more spacious. 

Charged at various locations including Chargefox DC chargers, AC chargers and Tesla superchargers. 
I found many posts online and a YouTube video which stated that both Chargefox and Tesla chargers are free. I can confirm that the Chargefox RFID they provided did work with no issues, so Chargefox charging was free, but it certainly was easier to find a Tesla supercharger at various points along our route. 
One of the staff at the rental station mentioned Tesla chargers are free as well, but the other then said it wasn’t. I’ve still yet to find out for myself - will post back at some point about this.

There are Toll motorways in / around the airport area, and we crossed them when exiting the airport and when heading back. They save you about 30 minutes each way, so I’d recommend taking them. The charges are paid for by Sixt first, before they slap on a daily admin fee on top and charge it to your credit card. I was told it comes up to approx 10 AUD each way. Again, yet to find out at this stage but seems reasonable. 

I had an issue with Sixt trying to reverse the charges of the ATTO 3 which I originally booked, as I had upgraded to the Tesla at the time, but they promise it would be a complete refund and that it should all go through soon. Overall, they seemed OK for a rental company. 

There certainly were positives and negatives when renting an EV whilst on holiday, some pretty obvious. One of the main downsides was the stress of ensuring we always have sufficient charge. The main upside was EVs drive great with lots of tech and safety features. Made me feel safe when on the motorways and it was super convenient to have reliable auto steer for the 1-2 hour road trips. 

Would I do it again though? Probably not, especially when travelling as a group which can be a bit tricky to plan around. It’s more convenient to hire a petrol/hybrid, which can also be plenty great on mileage. However, if you are interested to try an EV whilst on a holiday in Brisbane (and maybe even travelling solo or as a couple), it’s possibly slightly inconvenient but certainly doable! Sixt seems to be a good option to do this, compared to some of the other companies. It wasn’t clear if Hertz still provides free EVIE charging for their Polestar fleet but I found an article that stated they don’t do so anymore. We managed to get topped up along the way by planning early using the ABRP and Tesla apps which are awesome and very very accurate. The longest we ever had to wait for a DC charger was 20 minutes and that’s only because the car owner was unapologetically irresponsible and returned late to his vehicle.

Good luck on your rental! Happy to answer any questions if there’s any!

Three phase charging solutions
A coworker and I are thinking of getting EVs and while we both are planning on having beefy home chargers, having the ability to charge at work adds peace of mind and reduces our electric bill.

At work we have many unused 240v three phase outlets, but that’s the issue, US cars don’t take three phase. And only using two phases tends to make the electrical company unhappy. While we could go with level one chargers, it seems like a missed opportunity when we have enough power coming into the building for several dc fast chargers

Charging port on my Ioniq 5 was damaged at an EA station — now I'm facing a $2400 repair bill
**I’m sharing this to get advice and possibly connect with others who’ve had a similar experience.**

Recently, my Ioniq 5’s charging port was damaged while using an Electrify America charging station near my home. Here’s what happened:

My wife plugged in the charger — something she’s done many times before at the same location — and the session began normally. But after about 30 seconds, charging suddenly stopped, and she couldn’t unplug the charger. She contacted Electrify America, and a technician was sent out to help. Unfortunately, even he couldn’t remove the charger.

While this was happening, I also called Hyundai service, but they were unable to assist remotely. In the end, the EA technician **cut the cable** to free the car, and I had it towed to the dealership — **still with the EA plug attached** to the port.

The dealer was able to remove the connector and determined that the charging port had been damaged. I was then informed that this damage **is not covered under warranty**, and I would need to pay **about $2400 out of pocket**. When I contacted Electrify America, they also said they weren’t responsible.

We used the charger properly, followed instructions, and didn’t force anything. Still, neither company is accepting responsibility — and I’m left with a significant bill.

* Has anyone else experienced something like this?
* How did you handle it?
* Is there a recommended way to escalate this issue constructively?

Any advice or shared experience would be greatly appreciated.

Haifa Mayor demands closure of EV parking lot: ""Electric vehicles that catche fire are ticking time bombs, especially when Haifa is under rocket fire""
Yona Yahav declares war on electric vehicles

Following an electric vehicle being hit by a missile in the Neve Shaanan neighborhood, Haifa Mayor seeks to close a parking lot for storing electric vehicles in Haifa. Yahav: ""Electric vehicles are a ticking time bomb""

Doron Solomon

Updated 24.06.25, 08:47 

At the direction of Haifa Mayor Yona Yahav, the Haifa Municipality turned to the city's Magistrate's Court this weekend, requesting an immediate decision regarding a closure order it filed several months ago to vacate a lot for storing electric vehicles used by the Haifa Port.

In its appeal to the court, the Haifa Municipality emphasized that electric vehicles pose a serious danger due to their lithium-ion batteries. These batteries may enter a state of ""thermal runaway"" – an internal reaction that causes rapid heating, intense ignition and even repeated explosions.

An example of this danger, the Haifa Municipality notes, occurred when the rocket hit the Neve Sha'anan neighborhood last week, when an electric vehicle caught fire as a result of the rocket, and as a result, the vehicle's engine was blown nearly a kilometer away. 

Extinguishing an incident of this type requires extremely large amounts of water, specialized equipment, and a short response time, which are not fully available under security emergency conditions. In addition, there is a real danger of the fire re-igniting and spreading beyond the boundaries of the lot, even many hours after the initial fire has ended.

The Haifa Municipality attached to its request from the court a document with an opinion submitted to Yahav by the commander of the Haifa Fire Station, Assistant Chief Yitzhak Suissa, in which he emphasizes that ""the large number of vehicles, especially electric and hybrid, creates the potential for a complex fire in the event of a missile strike, and that the ignition of lithium batteries could lead to a large-scale fire, with dangerous spread and a domino effect of vehicles, which endangers residents and the entire environment.""

The Magistrate's Court rejected the Haifa Municipality's request yesterday since the one authorized to discuss the matter is the District Court, and the municipality is expected to submit a request to the District Court in the coming days for the immediate evacuation of the vehicles.

Meanwhile, the municipality issued a summons for a hearing to the operators of another lot used to store electric vehicles in the city, in order to decide whether to issue an administrative closure order for this lot as well.

Haifa Mayor Yona Yahav: ""An electric vehicle that catches fire is a ticking time bomb, especially when Haifa is under missile barrages and the fire services are working under unprecedented strain. This is a real danger, and I will not allow human lives to be endangered. I intend to fight this danger with full determination, and I will not let anyone gamble with the lives of Haifa residents. My responsibility is one - to protect the city's residents."""

Hyundai Ioniq 6 ICCU Fears
Everyone seems to be freaking out that these cars will just be bricked right away. Just do the recall if you’re so worried about it. They replace the part for free, then you never have to worry about it. I don’t see what all the hype is about. Yeah it’s annoying to need the service, and it’s not ideal the issue exists to begin with. But people writing off the car entirely because of it seems excessive"

Our 2024 Ioniq 5 Suddenly Died on the Road — Only Then Did We Learn Hidden Recalls
My husband and I purchased a brand-new 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 from OpenRoad Hyundai Richmond on a lease. In the roughly seven months we’ve had the vehicle, we used it primarily for commuting, school runs of our kids, and occasional leisure trips. We drove very carefully as it was my husband's dream car and the car was never in an accident or had any damage during this time.

On **Friday, June 20, 2025**, while my husband was driving, the car suddenly began beeping frantically and showed a “Check electrical system” warning, and told him to pull over. Despite being adequately charged, the car became completely immobilized and stranded him on the road. We had to urgently call the school to inform them of the delayed pickup and scramble to find a friend who could help pick up the kids. Thank goodness the kids were not in the car when it became stranded on the road, as even adults could feel confused and anxious in that situation—let alone young children.

After researching online, we found that many Hyundai owners had reported experiencing similar problems. That night, my husband had to call a tow truck to bring the car back home. Even after charging it overnight, the vehicle remained completely dead/non-functional.

On **Saturday, June 21, 2025**, we had the vehicle towed to the OpenRoad Hyundai Richmond. Later that day, a representative from the service department called my husband to inform him that our car was subject to **two** recalls. We were genuinely shocked—this was the first time we had heard of any recall affecting our car. We received recall mails when we had other cars, but we never received any recall mail notification from Hyundai. We later found out both recalls were related to the ICCU (Integrated Charging Control Unit) issue.

At no point during the purchase process did anyone from the sales department inform us of an active recall—Transport Canada Recall #2024-174—issued in March 2024 regarding the ICCU issue affecting the 2024 Ioniq 5 and other Hyundai models. We were also not informed whether the ICCU issue had been addressed or repaired on our specific vehicle prior to the sale.

Had we been made aware of any of this information, we would never have agreed to lease the vehicle, as no consumer would knowingly choose a car with a known risk of becoming unpredictably immobilized on the road.

Upon further research, we discovered the first recall (Transport Canada #2024-174) was published on **March 15, 2024** on Transport Canada’s website, and the second (Recall #2024-701) on **November 18, 2024**. Both address the same ICCU defect, with the second recall replacing the first as it required to recall more models of Hyundai cars. Both recalls address essentially the same issue, and the second recall specifically states: *""Vehicles that were repaired under \[recall #2024-174\] also require this repair.""* We question whether the initial recall repair was truly effective. If it was, why would a second recall be issued just a few months later, requiring even previously repaired vehicles to undergo additional repairs for the same issue? According to experiences shared by other owners online, some have undergone multiple repairs due to the persistent nature of the problem, and some in the United States have pursued vehicle buybacks under lemon law provisions.

As the recall notice warns of *“there could be a loss of power to the wheels.”* This is clearly a **serious safety issue**, not a cosmetic or minor defect that might be acceptable to overlook if not disclosed upfront. Although the car was new at the time of purchase, the existence of an active recall concerning a serious safety issue—**which was not disclosed to us**—would have made it clear that the ICCU defect was a known and recognized problem. Had we been informed, we would have understood that it posed a significant risk to our family’s safety.

While the exact timing of the car becoming immobilized may have been unpredictable, the likelihood of it happening was high, as damage to the 12V battery can develop over time. Unfortunately, it did happen—and it has placed us in a difficult and stressful situation.

We would like to give the dealership the benefit of the doubt and hope that they inspected our vehicle with full awareness of the March recall and addressed any issues that may have been identified. If the dealership did perform any inspection or repairs prior to the sale, we would greatly appreciate receiving documentation confirming that this work was completed.

However, to date, we have not been provided with any records or evidence of such an inspection. If any repair was conducted, it should have been documented as part of the vehicle’s service or delivery history. We are genuinely interested in understanding how Recall #2024-174 was handled by the manufacturer or dealership with respect to our specific vehicle. Was there a process in place to ensure the vehicle’s safety before it was handed over to us—particularly given that an active recall was affecting other identical models on the market at the time?

If the manufacturer or dealership had not inspected or resolved the issue prior to our purchase—or if they were under no legal obligation to disclose the recall information before the sale—then at the very least, we should have been informed of the active recall **immediately after** the purchase, especially since Recall #2024-174 was still active at the time and there is no indication that any prior work had been done on our vehicle.

Had we been notified even the following day, we would have had an opportunity to consider the implications and potentially exit the lease agreement, as there is a one full business day “cooling-off” period in place for such decisions.

However, despite multiple in-person interactions during and after the purchase, **no one informed us of the recall**. Some might argue that a brand-new car shouldn't require a recall notice—but it’s widely understood that when a model is recalled, **every vehicle of that model is included**, regardless of whether it is one day or one year old.

Where is the cutoff for deciding how old a car must be—or how long it must have been owned—to qualify for recall notification? Who determines which vehicles should be covered and which should not? Is there any meaningful difference between a car that is 99 days old versus one that is 100 days old? Or between a car purchased yesterday versus one purchased a year ago?

Who made the decision not to notify us of Recall #2024-174, which had been active for six months prior to our purchase? And if it was inspected/fixed according to the recall regulation, why was no documentation provided to confirm that the issue had been addressed or resolved beforehand?

Can it truly be argued, with confidence, that a newly purchased car is exempt from recall responsibilities? What breakdown in the process led to us not being notified of the recall information in a timely manner?

We also want to emphasize the potential danger this ICCU defect poses. We recently took a family trip to Squamish using the Sea-to-Sky Highway. Thinking back, we are horrified by the thought of this issue occurring while driving on that highway—with children in the car. Some sections of that route have no shoulders or safe areas to pull over. We can’t imagine how terrifying and dangerous it would have been if the vehicle had suddenly demanded to be pulled over while we were on a narrow, high-speed stretch of road. This situation could have led to a serious accident or exposed our family to significant danger.

Further, the November 2024 recall states:

“Hyundai will notify owners by mail and advise you to take your vehicle to a dealership to update the vehicle software.”

To date, we have **never** received any recall notification from Hyundai by mail. Some may say the Canada Post strike in late 2024 as a reason, but that ended in December. It has now been six months, and we still have not received any mails regarding the recall. With all the different brands of cars we had before we received mail notification.

Additional incidents have further eroded our trust in both Hyundai and the dealership. After the car was dropped off on Saturday, a staff member from the service department sent my husband a video showing work being performed on a vehicle they claimed was ours. However, it was **not our car**. This raised our concerns about whether our vehicle was correctly registered and if our personal data could be at risk due to a mix-up in vehicle identification. We wonder if the other customer knew about that incident or if there were other information mistakenly and carelessly handled?

What upsets us more was that when we visited the dealership on **Sunday, June 22, 2025**, we found our car sitting **unlocked** in the outdoor parking lot with the doorhandles poking open. The service department was closed that day, and no work was in process on the vehicle. This careless handling left the vehicle vulnerable to theft or tampering. Our children had left money and personal items inside the car and our insurance documents are in the car. While we understand that cars may be unlocked during servicing for convenience, there is no justification for leaving a customer’s vehicle unsecured on a day when no service staff are present. Who would take responsibility if confidential documents were stolen? The car appeared to have sat there **unlocked overnight**—who knows what may have happened in that time?

Air Conditioning/Preconditioning Question
Coming to the community as someone still in ICE cars, and probably for awhile, but will probably get an EV of some sort when the time comes for the next car. Currently drive a 2014 IS250 and keeping it cool in the summer heat is starting to become an issue.. the car only has two lowly console vents for the back seat and due to some family job changes I am driving the kids around a lot more with activities and errands. If we park somewhere more than 15 minutes or so the car takes 20+ minutes to get the back cooled down again, that’s always been the case it’s just an actual issue now. It’s tinted and I try to find shade where I can, keep the sunroof closed, but when it’s hot in the south there’s just nothing you can really do. 

So with EVs, are basically all makes/models able to precondition the interior or maintain a temp while we stop somewhere for a bit? Are there any cars better about rear AC than others? I’d be able to charge at home and drive at most 100 miles a day so most cars out there have enough capacity for that to not be an issue. "

Why am I facing nothing but hardships with EVs
I have had my Tesla model 3 for about a month and I have faced several issues. First when I got the car nobody told me to use superchargers or even public charges you need to have payment on the app. Nobody at all said anything about the apps. Then the drip charger the car came with has been acting up. They gave me a defective one. It just trips the breaker over and over again I can't even charge from home. It took be about a week to get the apps like evgo and chargepoint to be all set up and ready to go. Even after a month of talking to the people at Tesla I STILL CANT GET MY CAR ON MY APP so I still can't supercharge. I liked it when cars got a full tank in 2 minutes and once you drove it off the lot it would run fine without any serious issues for the next decade. EVs in my experience have only ever been good on paper."

How unique is the Tesla infotainment system?
I have a 2013 Model S and I travel a bit and when I do I rent a car.  On my latest trip I’ve rented a Toyota Rav 4 with Apple car play.  A few things jumped out at me.  For a company as large and successful as Toyota I can’t believe how horrible the experience was.  I jump into the car, pare my cell phone and launch down the road.  I discovered I have to download some Toyota mobile app, register and then I have to stop to add the vehicle VIN?   All of this to get google maps on the screen.  WTF Toyota. 

So this brings me to my question for this subreddit.  I’m thinking of replacing my Tesla but with what brand?    Does every car manufacturer suck as much as the Toyota?   Is it just an Apple problem or is this common?   BTW on the rental car road trip there was all sorts of other connectivity issues like some things worked wired and some worked wireless.   It’s only a rental but I wouldn’t put up with this for a daily driver."

Electric company wants to pay me $10/month to control overnight charging. Bad for battery health?
Basically title. But longer version is this: my electric company has a few different incentive programs for EVs, one of which they call ""Smart Charge Management"". In exchange for a $10 bill credit each month, I let me electric company remotely control when my EV charges overnight. They estimate how much power I need to reach a full charge by 6am and select special times that is most convenient for the grid to get to full.

Issue for me is this. I live in MD, and in the winter it can get as cold as 0 degrees farenheit (-18c). I thought super cold was bad for battery and the cars warm themselves periodically to avoid issues. If my electric company turns off my charger in the middle of the night for any period of time, isn't that bad for battery health?"

Lawsuits, recalls & impacts to *previous* owners?
Tried to make this as non-inflammatory as possible. I think leaving out make/model info is best. For this discussion, assume there is no corporate bankruptcy involved.

&nbsp;

I own an EV that has a number of issues. Some are related to recalls, some are the subject of potential class action lawsuits. No telling how long it could take before those reach any sort of conclusion.

&nbsp;

I'm feeling like I'm ""stuck"" holding onto the vehicle, because any potential payments/buybacks wouldn't be offered to people that no longer owned the vehicle. But I WAS significantly negatively impacted by these issues, and they are definitely going to decrease the value of the car when I sell.

Most issues are things where there is no ""fix"", so there was no explicit cost to me to have something repaired.

&nbsp;

Has anyone been through this sort of thing before with a previous vehicle?

Wondering if I should pull the plug and sell sooner (before the value tanks further), or if I really *need* to hold out to have any chance at proper compensation."

Weird EA America issue
**Apparently, EA stores information in the charger that you have used and may start a new session, using your ID/Credentials/Account, hours later.**

The first time this happened was about 2 months ago. I started a charge and walked into the nearby store, but got a quick message that my session had stopped (less than 5 minutes after I started it). I walked back to my car and saw the ""thank you for charging"" screen, but it had the wrong name shown (not me, even though I had used my phone to connect). I re-initiated the charging session and the second time it worked normally.



Today, I charged at \~1pm at my local EA station. I completed my charge and drove to work, and got the typical session summary email. Now at work (\~20 miles away from the EA station), and \~ two hours later, I got a second session summary email thanking me for charging with a session time ending at \~4pm. 

*Neither my car, nor my phone, are within 20 miles of that station. So EA apparently incorrectly thinks the car that charged at 4pm was mine, but it was not.*

I wasn't charged any money for either session (both were shorter than 30 minutes, and I am using the Ioniq 2 free years of charging), but I thought EA customer service should know that this weird anomaly has happened twice at that location.

I spent way (way) too long on the phone with EA customer service explaining the weirdness, and sharing the email session numbers, but they really do not believe that it wasn't my car, my phone, my account. They eventually tried to convince me it must be a family member using my account. 

They just cannot seem to believe that what has happened to me, twice, at that same EA location, could be happening.

I have no reason to make this up, if you see charging session notifications (and you didn't just charge) it may in fact be the same issue with EA misidentifying/saving the wrong car ID, or whatever. I bet whomever just got a free charge attributed to my account has no idea that it happened. Just a strange situation."

Level 1 Charging - Outlet Temperature
Charging with the portable charger my car came with, pulling about 11.5A.

Using a 120V 15A circuit in my garage, the 15A GFCI receptacle is getting hot.

  
The receptacle is 39C (102F) on the sides. Inside the outlet prong hole that isn't used, it shows 49C (120F) or higher depending on the angle of my thermal camera.

  
Is this normal? I know there have/had issues with this outlet before (loose wire causing my outdoor receptacle to not be connected, improperly stripped wires, paint causing stuck test/reset button).

What is the current state of the charging network in Europe?
In many countries there are issues with charger reliability, broken chargers not being updated in apps and a general mess of different apps and accounts that often don't work properly. This is annoying for everybody and disqualifies many older folks from ever wanting to deal with that. A single bad experience can ruin someone's thoughts on EVs. 

In my view, the whole industry should have followed Tesla and created a standard protocol where all you need to do is plug in, and the car does everything else.

EV meltdown after 5 minutes of charging
My brand new EV had a total meltdown after 5 minutes of charging. 

The day after bringing home a brand new EV, I plugged it into my Level 1 charger (which was itself plugged into an extension cord because the charger wouldn't reach the available outlet). Within 5 minutes, I got an app notification that charging was unsuccessful. I checked on the car and discovered a red warning on the dashboard. The car would not start at all and had to be towed. The dealer's initial diagnostics revealed that something is wrong that cannot be resolved with a simple reset. 

Is it possible for something in my charger setup to have fried the car within 5 minutes?! The charger (via extension cord) was plugged into one plug of a two-plug outlet. My garage door opener is plugged into the other plug and did not have any issues. "

EV Tax Credits Are Under Risk but not gone, if you’re US-based write your rep/senators!
The ongoing megabll in US Congress is looking to eliminate programs and subsidies that spurred big-time investment in American EV manufacturing, especially in rural states. If you’re an American, and particularly if you live in a state with battery/EV plants (Georgia, Illinois, Michigan, Pennsylvania, South Carolina, etc.) consider writing your representative a letter with this form.

It’s our best shot at protecting the credits in the US—meaning not just the tax credit you get buying an EV but the incentive companies have to make them here in the first place. The fight is far from over. This isn’t a partisan/politics issue it’s about massive investments manufacturers made on prior Congressional policy. Lots of jobs and the American auto industry on the line :/

PSA: Do not add your recently purchased used EV to EVGo AutoCharge+
Hey all,

I am sorry for the rant and honestly I feel like a bit of a Karen, but EVGo is driving me up the wall and its not even for refusing to repair my local frequented station for over 12 months now (a rant for a different day). Basically if you don't want to read my whole rant:

DO NOT USE EVgo AutoCharge+ on a used Vehicle that you have purchased, or better yet, do not use AutoCharge+ AT ALL. EVGo has a buggy system that can lead to previous owners being able to charge your account with their new vehicles and blindly denies claims related to this bug.

I recently traded my BMW i3 in for a used Polestar 2 at a used car dealership. The first time that I went to use an EVGo station, I removed my BMW i3 and added my Polestar, including activating Autocharge+. My i3 was not eligible for Autocharge+. Then a few days later I got a notification around 11:00 that my car had started charging. As it was in my garage, I was concerned and called the help line for EVGo. They restarted the station remotely but they attempted to charge again. The agent restarted the charger again and removed my last card from the account so no more cash could be pulled. I also deleted my Polestar from Autocharge+, then fully from the account, and changed my password. Looking back there was also a 3rd charge from early the previous morning that was not me. The agent submitted a ticket for the 3 charges totalling \~$15 as they said they have no control over the refunds or ability to remove access to Autocharge for my VIN.

The next day I received an email stating that the charges were not fraudulent as I am required to remove any car signed up for Autocharge+ when I turn it in.

Now in my mind there are 3 possible things happening here:

1. The previous owner of my Polestar did not remove Autocharge+ from their account and was accidentally charging me.
2. The new owner of my old BMW i3 added my car to their account including the VIN to their account and was somehow able to charge me despite me never being able to enable Autocharge+ on my old account and I had removed the BMW from EVGo by that point.
3. Someone had managed to hack my account. It can't be someone hacked my credit card as I was getting active charging notifications on the app.

It seems most likely that option 1 is what was occurring but either way in my mind it was clearly fraud or an issue on the back end of their system. And since I bought the car at a dealer its not like I can reach out to the previous owner and ask them to remove the car. After multiple back and forth emails where I in detail explained the situation stated that I never had a car on AutoCharge+ that I didn't own, the support agent has settled on stating: *Upon further reviewing the transactions, they are valid and the vehicle has been charged accordingly.*

The charges are only $15 but since I am not confident how someone was able to charge a different car and use money from my account I have been super frustrated by this. I also don't have charging at home and somewhat rely on the EVGo chargers when I can't get a Lvl 2 charger at work so I really wanted the to solve the back end issue. If it is simply that the previous owner still has my car tied to the account they should at least be able to confirm that it has been removed. I submitted a fraud claim for the 3 charges with my credit card though I fully expect them to side with EVGo since I can't prove that it was not me charging, besides a timestamped screenshot of my car app stating a different location. I also plan to submit a CFPB complaint, though that department just got gutted by DOGE....

So basically, it seems like there is a bug in the EVGo system where AutoCharge+ automatically charges you if the previous owner of your car does not deactivate AutoCharge+ on their EVGo account. If true that is an absurd bug and EVGo has an incompetent system in place. Hopefully going forward the credit card readers on the chargers.

Sorry for the rant, is there something I am missing? AITA? Am I turning into a Karen?"

Home charger installation
Hey guys,

I’ve been looking to install an at home ev charger and the plug in my garage is faulty.
The first and only person to I’ve got a quote from so far quoted me 6k because my breaker box is in the basement and is too old (1950’s) but what gives me suspicion is a) so far I’ve seen people say they paid 1k for someone to dig up a wire 50 feet for it, the highest I’ve seen someone get quoted so far is 2k and b) he said he wouldn’t even sleep in this house another night if he was me.
I’ve never had a single electrical issue in this house, even with power outages and storms in all the years I’ve lived here.
I know he’s probably quoting me unreasonably high, but do you guys think I’ll need to replace my breaker box in your experience? And if so, what would you guess that will cost?

Thank you!!

Home charger: 7.4 kW (monophase) or 11 kW (triphase)?
Hi.  I’m taking the EV plunge and am excited!  However, I don’t know what kind of charging system to install at home (I need to have a counter installed in my garage before installing the charge point.

It seems like the 7.4 kW (monophase) is sufficient for over-night charging.  And it’s a little cheaper to install.

But, should I be thinking about “future proofing” the system by having a triphase installation done right from the beginning?  Or just retrofit in the future if it becomes an issue?

Thanks in advance for any thoughts or advice."

Do most EV drivers carry adapter cables?
Greetings, I am a property manager for a number of Airbnb rental properties and we are starting to recommend to our homeowners that they add EV chargers to their homes to cater to the ever growing community of EV drivers.

Despite the fact that I do not own an EV (though I do not rule that possibility out some day), my tendency to be the most technologically competent person in my workplace has put me in charge of this initiative and I think I've learned quite a bit, but still have one gnawing question.

Hoping I'm not way off base here, but I understand that there is essentially two common kinds of cables in the US...Tesla and the J1772.  What I haven't been able to figure out is, how common it is for EV drivers to carry an adapter cable with them to ensure that they are good to go wherever the park to charge.  I feel that if I drove an EV, this is something I would carry, but I also carry a full set of breakdown gear whereas I know some people who don't even carry a spare tire.    
  
Mostly trying to figure out if having adapters available at each house would be a useful bonus to the point where it would outweigh the cost of them potentially disappearing, or if it's a non-issue since most people have one already."

electric semi-trucks?
trucker here, seen plenty of hubbub about various electric semis allegedly in production. honestly seen more *propane* and *lng* trucks on the highways than electric.

where are all these electric semis? did tesla ever deliver? what happened to the volvo electric semi?

no charging anywhere at any truck stop I've been to, and w/ the duty-cycle of trucking you *need* charging. 

anyone else work in transportation and wondered this? 

even LTL might have issues bcuz while daytime Pickup/Delivery might be doable on a battery, many of those same trucks run at night during 2nd/3rd shift doing linehaul. 

anybody seen actual deployment of electric semis beyond one or two advertisements?"

cost of operation for EV vs current ICE?
Thinking about switching from my low COO 2020 Impreza (\~$550/mo. to run \~2000mi/mo.) to an electric primarily because kwH might save about 20% on fuel costs plus I'm seeing cheap KONA and other brand EVs gently used for sub-$17k and less than 4 years old. I might push down the monthly payment from $250/mo. to about $180/mo. at that rate. 

However I would hafta plug into a garage outlet where I live, and have read about issues w/ using cords like that overnite... seeing how much I drive it'd be charging all the time no? is that a fire hazard?

also are there issues w/ buying an EV that has some miles on it? the depreciation on these things is *insane* but is there a *reason* behind that like rapid battery deterioration/loss of range? 

I live in new england where it's freaking cold, used to AWD cuz as a trucker I gotta show up to work even when it's a blizzard out, are cheaper EV models not AWD? maybe snowtires or studs? 

also has anyone noticed price gouging at service plaza chargers? I've seen high prices per kwH for fast-charging at plazas, so my monthly trips to visit family might not be much cheaper than running gas it seems. "

Problem with EV connect
Had a recent issue with EV connect. Tried to charge at one of their public stations on May 17 2025. 

Even with contacting customer service and attempting 3 different charging sessions was unable to charge. 

Each session put a 25 dollar hold on my credit card. Two of these holds released and one was billed.

I’ve contacted EV connect sent in a screenshot of the erroneous charge. And still I have not received a refund or an explanation. I did not receive anything for my money. My charge history demonstrates this fact.

Has anyone experienced a similar problem with this company? This was my first and last time using them. 

I’m currently disputing this through the bank. But truly I thought the company would resolve it or at least respond with their determination of the outcome "

Not having your own garage/driveway/charger
Hey,

Looking to get my first EV, but as the title says, I won’t have the ability to charge at home.

I’d like to hear from other apartment dwellers who went EV despite having to rely on public chargers.

I live in the Netherlands and my neighbourhood, like most these days, does have a few scattered public chargers. Including one in a row of public parking spots I use anyway.

There’s a limited number of chargers at my work as well, but these are often in use.

The main issue near my home is that there is a shortage of parking spaces and I often see petrol cars using the spaces that should be reserved for EVs wanting to use the chargers.

Also, I know these aren’t as cheap as having your own home charging solution, especially if you have solar panels. But is the difference prohibitive?

At the moment I don’t really see a big issue. I don’t have a petrol pump at home for my petrol car either, after all. I might have to walk a little further if the nearest public charger is not available, but I can just move my car closer after the four hours it takes to charge it.

Am I being naive? What’s your experience?"

High mileage battery failure?
Looking to run an electric car for the next 10 years. Based on my numbers, I'd save about $20,000 CAD of gas expense over the next 10 years. 

If I end up in something with 60k kms now, I'd have 300k kms on the odometer. Would a battery failure issue offset the cost savings?

EV business model in the USA hopeless
The current EV market in the USA right now is broken.

Resale values for EVs is very low and people are getting rid of these hot potato vehicles before they hit their warranty expiration.

Once these vehicles hit the used car market people are scared of touching them for fear of a huge $10-$20k new high voltage battery bill.

The proponents of the current status quo say everything is Ok the risk of battery failure is overstated with links to mickey mouse studies saying how great the batteries are and how long they last.

The EV manufacturer warranties are pretty crappy, most are about 100,000 miles. I think Rivian has one that is 175,000 miles or so which is better.

The proponents say that 100,000 miles is the normal life of a gas engine so 100,000 is fine. I guess most of these people never owned gas cars for long because 200,000 miles is the new 100,000 mile limit people sort of set in their heads for expected life.  100,000 miles was probably a big deal in 60s or 70s but not anymore.

So if battery failures are so uncommon then why do I see videos with people having Teslas towed away for battery replacement or see posts with people posting invoices showing the battery cost? Companies can make the battery warranty 200,000 miles then if it is so uncommon.

The insurance companies will not cover the battery failures from my understanding and the one company that I found offering such coverage has only been doing so for a year or so and does not seem like a legitimate insurance company to me.

The aftermarket companies offering battery replacements I could not find any in my city. The closest thing I found is some places like Ebay selling used batteries and some other place selling refurbished batteries so not the most reassuring.

So basically until the car manufacturers solve this issue, people are gonna be trading in their 4 yr old EVs like they trade in iPhone for new model and the old cars will probably be sent to the third world for scrap metal or recycling.

Anyways that is my opinion.

Corsa-e DC charging issue
Hi all. I have a 2021 Vauxhall Corsa-e with about 30,000 miles on it. Last year while on a long trip to Dorset on about 3 separate occasions at separate ultra-rapid charge points my car would stop charging after receiving about 30-50 miles range. The car would show charging complete but the charger would show that it's still charging but at 0 KWh or that it was connecting to vehicle. Not really a big deal at the time and I just tapped my card again and eventually got to enough charge to get home. I did another trip and used the same chargers about a month later with no issues and the car was receiving an impressive (for almost freezing weather) 70kwh. I never thought about it because I almost never use DC charging, I almost exclusively charge at home using my Ohme charger - which has only ever failed me once in well over a year for unknown reasons. 
I'm doing another big trip down south soon so practiced DC charging my car at a local Sainsbury's and this time it stayed stuck at initiating charge. My car was flashing green as if it was charging, and the dash had the charging display but wasn't charging. The charger itself just said initiating charge. It sat like this while I did my whole shopping. So now I'm a little nervous for my trip. 
Has anyone else had any similar issues, or do I need to contact Vauxhall? "

$2.4K (US) quote to replace a single headlight on the VW ID.4 pro (component pricing are getting out of hand)
2.4k was from the dealership, includes 1.4k for a headlight assembly and 5 hours of labor (the whole bumper needs to come off)

I found a third party site that sells the part for ~$600 and a shop that will install it for $350, but that’s still $1k to fix a single led strip. 

The ID.4 has an intregrated LED light bar in the headlight assembly. There is no way to shut it off while driving, it is always on. 

My drivers side just failed, normal headlights work fine. 

They can’t just replace the daytime running light, they can only replace the whole headlight assembly. 

This wouldn’t be (as big of) an issue if I could just turn off my daytime runners, but on the ID.4, there is NO option for this. 

So now I’m forced to pay $2400 through VW or $1000 through a third party just so my car is aesthetically pleasing (One daytime headlight not ALWAYS out). Which also may put the car on a cops radar as well to let me know I have a headlight out. But that’s just anxiety.

I’m just curious, anyone else facing these hard to swallow prices for what should be cheap, easily replaceable tech/components? This isn’t even the matrix headlights. Just standard…

It’s crazy to think that If I needed both headlights replaced on an ID.4, I’m looking at $~4,000 (from VW), almost 1/10th of the cars total original value. 


I’m just in complete shock with this

A Dealer Is Selling A Hummer EV For $38,000 Off And It's Not A Fluke - The Autopian
From the comments:

>I work at a GMC dealership and let me tell you that while these things are cool, they truly do not move. The biggest issue is the other GMC models around them....**but the real poison pill is the Sierra EV that we are starting to get on lots**

>The Sierra EV is like the old Avalanche with the midgate which can make a 10ft bed in the right configuration. Gets 50% better range with the same batteries (460mi vs 320mi), still has 760 hp and the kicker is that it starts in the $60k range. A fully loaded Sierra EV is only a little bit more than the entry price for a Hummer EV. It makes no sense to choose the Hummer.

Anyone got any ideas.
Hi,
So I have an MyEnergy Zappi connected to Octopus via a Hub connected to our router. 
It's been brilliant so far and it was free since it was left to us by the previous owners of the house. 

However, recently we have experienced some annoying hiccups. So we had a week without our EV due to some repairs. When it came back to us we plugged it in to find it would not charge the car. The Zappi displayed ""EV Disconnected"" after some investigating we found out it wasn't the car. It would charge on AC at various charging points near us. After pulling our hair out I called MyEnergy Technical Support where mysteriously while on phone and asked to plug the car in the charger started working fine. The support advisor checked the system online and seemed okay. 

We then go away on a long 2 and week bit holiday. Leaving the EV on the drive unplugged and on our return it's started doing the same thing. Same display ""EV Disconnected"" Only this time we can not get it to charge. Again it seems to charge on a various other charging points so we don't think it's the car but now MyEnergy aren't sure what the issue is. They are telling me I need to either replace the cable or have the unit refurbished at my expense due to being out of warranty. they advised me way to cleaning the connectors safely which have been done but no luck. 

There's no damage to the cable as far I can see and it's not been moved its just not been used in two weeks but how can it just suddenly stop working like that? I don't understand. I also don't understand how MyEnergy can be sure the cable is faulty without inspecting the unit? "

How to solve Bmw i4 edrive40 iDrive stuck on the logo issue
Hi, I’ve an i4 e40 2023 for couple days and I have an issue that i mentioned on the title.

This evening when I approached to the car; car was normally opened and when I get into the car, the idrive 8 screen stuck on the bmw logo and also the screen on the left and the steering wheel buttons were not responding for any attempt.

I’ve tried getting off from the car, and then locking fully and getting back into it but the screen did not turn off when I go further than the range of auto unlock distance (so it stuck “ON” continually)

I couldn’t be able to chose driver so the seat was not set automatically to my position.

I also tried to press the volume button (next to the hazard lights button) for a long time to reset idrive system and it doesn’t work.

After all that I came back to home and Plugged into my AC wallbox and went back to house. But my vehicle still has the same screen stuck error and the right side screen is always showing “BMW” logo in the center of it and keeps stuck.

I will drop the children off at school in the morning. And want to solve it before I leave the car in public parking.

How can i solve this problem? Any help would be appreciated. 🙏 I’m new on electric bmw."

New 3-row EV comparison
Below is the summary by Google NotebookLM

* **Kia EV9**
   * **Price:** Starts at $54,900, or basically $55,000, making it the cheapest and best value vehicle in the three-row segment. The as-tested price of the specific model shown was just over $70,000, around $72,000. You can get the Land trim with a large battery pack and dual motor for this price. Leasing is also mentioned as very cheap, around $299 per month with about $2500 down (taxes included in Colorado).
   * **Range:** The video mentions the EPA rated range is put up. The large battery pack is almost 100 kilowatt hours. The range is described as ""not all that much,"" just under 100 kilowatt hours, but considered an ""easy justification"" for the price.
   * **Charging Performance:** Charging performance is noted as being good due to its EGMP platform. The peak charging speed is about 220 kW briefly, but most of the time it's about 200 kW, and it holds this speed deep into the pack, sitting at just about 200 kW up to 80%. This makes it an amazing charging vehicle for road trips. However, it's the only vehicle in the comparison that doesn't natively interface well with the Tesla Supercharger network, getting a maximum of 84 kW currently, though this is expected to increase to 125 kW for model year 2026. It uses an onboard booster for Supercharging and can be buggy.
* **Cadillac Vistic**
   * **Price:** Described as ""quite a bit more money than the Kia,"" starting around $80,000 base, with the as-tested model around $84,000. Higher trims can go up to $100,000.
   * **Range:** Shares the Lyric battery, which GM quotes as 102 kilowatt hours capacity, though it's closer to 105-106 kWh. The battery capacity is only about 10 to 20 kWh more than the smaller Equinox and Optic, which feels like a lot of money for the battery size in a large car. The range is mentioned as being one of the ""big oversightes"".
   * **Charging Performance:** The charging performance ""sucks,"" taking about 40 something minutes to charge from 10% to 80%. The peak charging speed is only 185-190 kW, making it the only vehicle in the comparison that can't hit 200 kW. The charging curve involves a boost profile for 5 to 10 minutes at 500 amps, then drops down, and is generally ""not a great curve"". It has ""crap charging performance,"" described as the ""worst of the bunch"". It requires a very low voltage system and needs ""all the amps in the world"".
* **Volvo EX90**
   * **Price:** Very expensive, with the as-tested price being $94,000. A base lease was mentioned as almost $1,100 per month. It is described as priced ""pretty well"" because it feels expensive. It feels more expensive than the Rivian by a lot.
   * **Range:** On paper, the range is described as ""kind of mid-tier"". It has around 100 kWh usable battery capacity.
   * **Charging Performance:** On paper, the charging is also described as ""kind of mid-tier"". It's a low voltage system architecture that requests 600 amps or more from a charging station, but public infrastructure in the US doesn't widely support this. On a Supercharger, it's locked at 500 amps, resulting in about 210 kW charging. Volvo claims 10-80% charging in 30 minutes, which is described as ""not that bad,"" but the curve is stepped. Its charging performance ""feels a bit weak sauce"" and ""a little bit prototypy,"" though potentially improvable over the air. It is one of the better vehicles in the comparison for charging time (10-80% in about 30 minutes). It is the only non-Tesla passenger vehicle sold in the US that requests more than 500 amps.
* **Rivian R1S**
   * **Price:** The most expensive vehicle in the comparison, with the as-tested price being $105,000. However, a Rivian R1S can be had for as low as $75,000. At $105,000, it's speced up with pretty much everything. The price is mentioned as something they ""don't like"". Even at $75,000 for a base one, it's considered ""kind of okay,"" but the quality is felt to have gone down from the first generation, and features are more often options now.
   * **Range:** Has the biggest battery of the bunch, around 145 kilowatt hours. It has the most range of capability.
   * **Charging Performance:** The peak charging speed is 210 kW on the tested model, which was slightly lower than an older Rivian model that got 219 kW. The charging performance ""sucks"" mostly due to thermal management. It's a big battery with weak cooling, causing the battery to get hot and limiting subsequent charging sessions. It's expensive to rely on DC charging with the Rivian as it's described as a ""brick"" and is the least efficient. It interfaces with the Supercharger network through an adapter and will soon have native ports.

In summary, the **Kia EV9** stands out for its **value** and solid, consistent charging performance up to 80%, despite having the lowest price and less overall range. The **Cadillac Vistic** is noted as a good highway cruiser but is criticized for its **slow charging speeds** and relatively small battery capacity for its price. The **Volvo EX90** is expensive but praised for feeling premium and driving well, with a good charging time, though its charging architecture is complex and its range/charging specs aren't top-tier on paper. The **Rivian R1S** is the most expensive vehicle, capable off-road, and has the biggest battery and most range, but is criticized for its build quality issues, relatively slow charging speeds for its battery size, and poor thermal management during consecutive charging sessions. The EV9 is considered the best budget option, the Vistic for the ""American guy"" who wants a cruiser, the EX90 is the preferred choice for on-road driving and overall quality, and the Rivian is for the ""lifestyle person"" who needs off-road capability."

Why no EREVs with modestly sized batteries?
To my knowledge, the US currently has no true EREVs (extended range EVs) available on the market today (correct?).  The only two that I know are coming are the Dodge Ramcharger and the Scout Terra, which for the Terra the gas engine would be an add-on. The Ramcharger's battery allows for 145 miles while the Terra's battery would give you a ballpark of 350 miles. 

Why not build an EREV with a battery sized for 60ish miles? A distance that would cover the daily needs of the vast majority of drivers and the range extender is there for towing or distance as needed. Batteries are the most expensive parts of EVs, and the battery would now be about 1/5th the size. Yes, there's the added cost of small engine. Even if the costs zeroed out (big battery only vs smaller battery with range extender), you'd fix the range anxiety issue with distance and/or towing. 

I realize we kind of have this with PHEVs, most of which get 35 mile-ish of range.  I feel a slightly bigger battery cost would be offset by not needing a transmission and complex hybrid design. And you'd have a true EV experience with lower total emissions. 

Full disclosure- I'm neither an EV owner (yet) nor an engineer. There may be something obvious I am missing.   :) "

High speed railways increase electric car adoption
>The central issue, Fang says, is driver concern over “range anxiety,” or worry that their electric vehicles will run out of battery charge on longer-distance trips and end up stranding them. Such drivers primarily use their electric vehicles for shorter travel or commuting to work, yet still need transportation for longer trips. 

To answer the question of whether high-speed rail connections would accelerate electric vehicle purchasing, the researchers looked at monthly data on vehicle sales spanning 328 cities. They examined both cities before and after they were connected to the rail systems, as well as cities that had never been connected. And they examined additional factors, including the presence of electric vehicle charging stations, the volume of road investments, and the effects of government industrial policies, to determine whether those affected electric vehicle sales.

Their research found that cities that were connected to the rail network earlier were also those that saw the earliest growth in the electric vehicle market. The best strategy for accelerating electric vehicle purchases, they concluded, was the combination of “complementary infrastructure,” or high-speed rail, and incentives for consumer purchasing.

Charged for 67kw by Chargepoint/Electrify while Ring shows my car in the driveway
Has anyone ever experienced this??? My husband sent me a screenshot of a charge to our account for a charging station that is 30min from our house (we charge overnight at home and never charge at public stations unless on a long range trip) and when I called electrify America customer service, they just kept repeating that it shows our car charged for 29 min through the app (Mercedes app in this case). We have owned non-Tesla ev’s like the Kia EV9 and Mustang that charged at non-tesla stations but never experienced anything like this where they are claiming our car was charging at a far away station at a time when we can document in 12 different ways that the car was in front of our house. 

Editing to add this has nothing to do with the login for my ChargePoint app. The charge was made through the Mercedes app for my specific vehicle, which requires multiple verification processes including a one time code sent to the screen on the vehicle. It was not charged to my CC by logging into my ChargePoint. It was charged from my Mercedes app through my specific vehicle to apply the charging credit issued by Mercedes, which is processed through Chargepoint. If you had my cars username and password, you could log into the MB app on MY phone but you couldn’t add my car to the MB app of your phone without having access to a lot more info, including a one time code sent to the vehicle. 

I am changing all my passwords (thank you to all the well intentioned suggestions) but does not explain how someone 30 min from my house could use my vehicle’s id connected to the car makers app to initiate a charge for a car that is not mine. "

Driving cross country - What did you learn or wish you knew?
Full context here: Family of 5 moving in the summer from California to the East coast. Dual EV household, '25 RZ300 and '22 ID.4 Pro. Selling or shipping the cars and flying isn't an option.

For those of you that have made a similar trip, what did you learn from it? What did you wish you knew going into it? I'm already well aware of the amount of stopping that we'll have to do, but we have around 10 days to make the drive, so time isn't an issue. 

Planning on using ABRP. Neither car has a NACS adapter - awaiting the official ones from Lexus and VW to avoid any aftermarket failure issues and voiding of warranty.

I have been a qualified electronic engineer for background however I’ve never touched anything ev before 

Is it possible to put a solar panel or two inside the car or out or something so that I can slowly charge the car during the week whilst I’m away so I can stand a chance of making home without wasting time before hand 

Many thanks to all for your time reading and hopefully a solution

Kia Niro and EV6 service issues and response.
Co-worker purchased Niro EV for daughter and EV6 for himself last year.

Niro was in the shop over 30 days, they hired a Lemon Law lawyer and Kia settled for $6k and told them to keep the repaired car and they would keep full warranty on it if future problems.

EV6 just bricked on them, no date for repair, and Kia has him in a new EV9 loaner.

Ioniq 9 is on my short list of 2026 vehicles to replace 2019 Tesla and Kia/Hyundai are same vehicles and service so a bit concerning about major service issues in first year.

Service response also a 50/50, a battle on the Niro, a bit smoother on the EV6."

Faulty charger/cable
Hi folks, not sure if any EV owners on here has come across this issue but any info to share would be grand.

I am based in the UK, I recently noticed a burnt L1 pin on the charging cable, the end that goes into the wall socket, checked the sock and it looks like the hole has changed colour also. I mainly charge at home and sometimes in the office as they provide EV bays. I use the charger like normal always ensure that the plugs are in correctly and snug, it still chargers like normal but I am now concerned about a fire hazard.

Took the car to the dealers (Mercedes) to do a diagnosis and they said its the wall charger that is causing the issue so they wont cover the replacement under warranty. I have a new build property which came with the wall charger, they said I need to raise a warranty claim with the manufacturer for the wall charger which I have done and now waiting for a response.

Has anyone come across a similar issue and is it likely caused by the wall socket itself?"

Problem with ford EV
I have two electric for vehicles. I got a 2024 lightning in March and I chose to get the pro station to get installed instead of my $1,000 rebate. I’ve been charging it since April and I’ve had no issues. My brother got a 2025 mache 5 days ago and for some reason everytime he plugs it into the charger, the charger shuts itself off and the only way to turn it on is to switch the breaker on and off. I charged my car right after, works just fine. It’s weird because sometimes it stays on charge for an hour, then it happens so it’s not instant everytime. My brother took his mache to a super charger and it charged just fine. We tried my friends charger in his home and that also worked just fine, although his charger has a 40 amp limit. Mine is set to 48 amps. It doesn’t make sense why one car works but another doesn’t."

Slate REX/EREV Conversion - A good idea?
Hey there. Sorry if I'm posting this is in the wrong space, but this is a thought I've had on my mind lately and I wanted to run it by someone with more knowledge on EVs and hybrids than me, and I figured that someone from this group would probably qualify. 

I'm assuming by now that you all have heard of the Slate Pickup. While I'm personally excited and eagerly await its arrival to the market late next year ( fingers crossed), my desire for it has a lot more to do with it being a cheap, basic, truly compact pickup ( something the market has lacked for quite some time) than with it being an EV. Indeed, being electric only is a bit of an issue for me as my city has limited public charging, and I live in an apartment so home charging is not ideal either. It's not a deal breaker, but I'm certainly amongst the group lamenting that the Slate isn't available with an ICE or even as a hybrid. And that got me thinking. While converting the Slate to an ICE or even a Plug in hybrid would be a ton of work, it feels like it would be an excellent candidate for a range extender. After all, it's designed like an ICE pickup, so it already has a natural spot for a generator (the frunk space). In principle all you'd need to do is convert all or part of the frunk space into an engine bay, install a small gas or diesel generator, and connect it to the Slate's AC charging system, with some type of controller to regulate the generator output. The benefits would be numerous. In addition to improving the range (which the Slate could certainly use), the ability to run it on liquid fuel when necessary, even if it isn't optimal, could open up the possibility of a Slate to people who would otherwise struggle to charge it, making it much more of the every man's vehichle that it is marketed to be.

So, that's my take. What do you guys think? Is this a worthwhile mod? And if so, is it something that the average Joe could do themselves with a bit of instruction? And how much would such a modification likely cost? "

How does the AWD work with two or more engines on EV’s with consideration of tire wear and and replacement?
In ICE the Haldex copplings and diff/gear can be sensitive and prone to failure if threadwear on tires is too great differance. Are the two axles independant or connected somehow? Hoping this is a none issue with EV. 

Many times in ICE if you get a puncture the recommendation is that you have to replace all the tires to get the same rotation speed cuz of threadwear."

Zeekr 001 Premium AWD – Cruise Control Glitchy in 1.0.1? Does 1.2 Fix It?

Hey everyone,

I recently test drove the Zeekr 001 Premium AWD (European version) and while I was very impressed with the performance, comfort, and design — I noticed something odd with the cruise control / adaptive cruise system.

The car I tried was running software version 1.0.1, and the adaptive cruise felt a bit glitchy or inconsistent, especially in slow traffic. The braking and acceleration didn’t feel as smooth or confident as I expected. For comparison, I also drove the Hyundai Ioniq 5 AWD, and its cruise system felt much more refined and natural.

So I’m wondering:
	•	Is this cruise control behavior normal for the Zeekr 001 on earlier firmware?
	•	How’s the software experience overall — any bugs, delays, or odd UI decisions?
	•	Does the 1.2 update actually fix the cruise control issues or improve drive assist features?
	•	How does it compare to other EVs you’ve tested (Ioniq 5, Model Y, BMW i4, etc)?
	•	If you own one: are you happy with it after a few months? Any regrets or surprises?

Also, if anyone has alternative suggestions in the ~220,000 QAR (~€55,000) range that offer great tech, smooth driver assist, and long-term reliability — I’d love to hear them!"

ViaLynk Charging Stations
Anyone else have a terrible experience with ViaLynk chargers?  Unfortunately they have a bit of a monopoly in all of the charging stations nearest to me, but they are broken/off network/randomly ""unavailable"" far more than they are available and working.  Literally I've been able to charge at their stations ONCE.  

Plus their customer service sucks.  I keep telling them about the specific issues with their charging stations and - crickets.  They never fix them so I'm stuck basically needing to Uber back and forth to working stations much farther away.  

The charging stations I'm having trouble with are all located in public parks in upstate NY - so a related question - does anyone know who I would complain to about allowing this horrible charging company to monopolize that space when they don't even work?   The municipality that owns the park?  The power company?  NYSERDA?  Any insight would be very welcome - thanks."

Technical Question: Damage to look for on a EV that has sat unmoving for 2 years or more.
I have looked on the internet and I have not seen a lot of technical support for EV's that have sat unmoving for more than 2 years. 

I'm interested in a used Chevy bolt. Its a buyback/lemon, probably because of the battery issue. All the ones I'm looking at have a new battery installed within the last 2 years, most within the last year. Most of the ones I'm looking at have been sitting at some dealership or at GM for over 24 months ... probably without moving or so Carfax says. Probably, outside on a lot. 

I'm worried about what type of long term damage that I wouldnt find until actually driving the car after the purchase. 

If I took the car to a independent mechanic who is experienced with used EV's would they be able to check over the vehicle and catch any problems from sitting around without moving for 2 years? 

What else should we be worried about? 

All the cars will have new tires, we already figured that one out. 

Most likely we will be getting the dealership to pay for a full break flush. We've also got that one covered. 

But I'm still worried about plastic and seals that have been sitting around in the elements/sun/winter and not being used for over 2 years (probably as GM was waiting for more batteries to put in the Bolt). 

All suggestions, information, help is welcomed."

Car parked in garage, which is carpeted.
So we just bought a new car and everything has been great so far. We keep the car in the garage, where we charge it at night. We have a large area rug in our garage that used to be in our living room (it was in rough shape) and it helps protect the garage floor in addition to it feeling nicer when we go out there without shoes on. I just read something that the heat from the car might be an issue when its warming up in the Winter. We always started our ICE cars in there without issue. Should I be remove the rug prior to the Winter or is this nothing to worry about? Thanks in advance!"

KIA Sportage PHEV sx 2024 - Water in oil due to too much EV driving?
I have a Sportage PHEV 2024 that I bought new last year.  
We mostly drive EV during the week for work, and often use the combustion engine in the weekend for longer drive. 

We did out first oil change in October 2024 with no issue.  
  
Last week we did our 2nd oil change and we were flagged that we had a lot of water in our oil. So much so that our mechanician told us to not drive the car before a major checkup by the dealership. He was afraid the engine was dead. For the past 2 weeks we only used the ev engine, so we assumed an issue could have appeared without us noticing.

The dealership tested for pressure issue in the engine and tested for leaks, all came back good.  
They told us water in oil is normal behavior for these car and we should 'simply use the combustion engine more'.

My questions are the following:  
A) Is that really true? I see mentions online of condensation in oil for phev and hybrid vehicle, but I don't feels it gets to the point of our mechanician telling us there is so much of it it's dangerous.  
  
B) If it's ok, how much more driving am I supposed to do on  the combustion engine?  In the winter, we drive about 20min to work in the morning with the engine on for heat, same when we come back. Am I suppose to let the engine run idle longer? Or switch to sport mode to ensure higher temperature?

Thanks for any advice or comparaison to your own experience with Sportage/Any phev vehicles."

Nest way to charge my EV
Hi,
I have a BMW iX1, and I usually dont't charge it at home, because I don't have the coditions I need. But I make an effort to charge it on AC, tipically until 80%.

The thing is that I'm facing some issues charging it for longer times...

Is it preferable:
(1) to let it drop to 15-20% and perform a single charge to 80%
(2) to let it drop to 15-20% and charge it gradually for example 15-20%/day until 80%
(3) or just keep it at 80% as much as possible, performing regular AC charges?

I was mostly on (1) but now I'm closer to (2) that's why I'm asking.

Thank you!"

Circle K Troubles in Virginia
I had a poor initial experience at a Circle K EV Charging station in Wytheville, Virginia. I had planned to stop there as that was the most convenient stopping point on our return trip home. The Equinox EV mapped it out and accurately estimated we'd have 20% charge left arriving at the station. When I pulled up, none of the stations were being used. I already had the app set up prior to the trip with my credit card added and approved.

The first issue was how difficult it was to physically pull the cord to my vehicle, which was parked fully up in the spot on the correct side and about 10 feet from the station. The cable that secured the cord  was so resistant, I had to put it over my shoulder and lean forward and grind step-by-step to my vehicle's outlet. I'm no he-man, at about 162 pounds, but I know this was too tight. And later I found the cable securing the other plug was also just as tight. When you plug it into the vehicle, you can feel how strong the tension is pulling against the cable. I was sure the plug would be yanked back out just by the tension alone.

The next issue I had was getting the app to communicate with the charger. I kept pushing start on my app, but it didn't do anything. All it did was tell me to follow the instructions on the charging station monitor. I needed a few minutes of charging at least, so I threw my hands up and went to the charging terminal and followed the instructions, paying with my card via google pay which then dinged me for a $50 pre-approval because I wasn't using the app. The charging station clicked loudly and finally began charging.

After five minutes the charging stopped telling me there was an issue with the charging unit. I unplugged and then plugged the other charging cable in. Went through the start-up process again, and again, the app wasn't allowing me to start the session. Another $50 pre-approval, and the unit was charging again. This time I got 10 minutes of charging and the unit stopped, showing me a QR code on the screen and reporting an error. I saw the unit reboot itself, but it was not functioning after that.

Luckily that was all the charge I needed to get home, but what a terrible experience. I charged months ago at a Tesla charging station outside a Sheetz and found the experience with the app very easy and functional (along with the charger itself).

Hopefully this is just a one-off issue and not something I need to be concerned about. I know my wife stated she had no issues using the app in the past when she charged at a Circle K. 🤷‍♂️"

Concerns About Motion Sickness
Hi all,

I am seriously considering purchasing a 2025 Mustang Mach E, it is a car I love the styling for and the incentives are looking very nice right now. My problem is I am finding myself most concerned about potential motion sickness while driving. I posted in the Mach E community and did get a lot of responses telling me that the vehicle has caused motion sickness but general consensus seemed to be it would go away. Posting again here hoping to get more insight on that and if it should be such a concern for my purchase. I live in a small town with lots of stop/go in my daily driving, but I do frequently drive for an 1-3 hour trips to the city and to visit my in-laws. 

I am very sensitive to motion sickness and I have anxiety about throwing up, so driving in my gas car can already be a stressful thing for me. I notice this mostly on windy roads, but sometimes on the highway as well. I’ve taken the Mach E for two test drives, one for 15m around town and another for 30m mix of town and highway but more highway. Both a mix of OPD and TPD across all three driving modes. I did feel some dizziness after the second drive, but it could have been my anxiety too.

I would really appreciate any opinions and advice that may sway me in a direction here. I really like the vehicle and want to buy it, but I’m having a lot of anxiety about being sick every time I drive which is already a frequent issue for me. "

Shout out to ChargePoint level 2 at home
In February I traded in my '22 Ioniq 5 for the '25 XRT.  As usual, Hyundai is ahead of the curve and the new car has an NACS port.  As the weather in finally warming up in Colorado, I ordered an NACS cable directly from ChargePoint.  It took less than 10 minutes to remove the old and install the new and couldn't have been easier - directions were crystal clear.  The fact that the at home owner can do this themselves is amazing and cost effective.

Do they make aftermarket battery packs for the 2012 Mitsubishi i-miev
I saw one for sale for pretty cheap on Facebook, however I was wondering if the batteries in the I-Miev (ad said max charge it would  go 60mi, but wasn't sure if the vehicle currently does that or if the battery degraded over time) had the same issues as the 2011-2012 Nissan Leaf. If they do, I was wondering if there are any aftermarket battery packs available for the I-Miev like there are for the lea? Also was wondering if charging at a charge station was bad for the battery and if it was recommended to just charge it at home?"

Why most of the ev brands are plagued by 12v batterry and ICCU issues?
I drive an ICE vehicle currently but have been looking to make the switch to EV but following through different forums, it seems like almost every brand is plagued by issues related to failure in 12v battery and/or ICCU. Why is this such a prominent issue that no brand is able to figure out a reliable solution to it? I mean some of these vehicles and brands are successfully operating on impressive feats of engineering but seems like this 12v battery issue is either not being given enough importance and/or they are unable to figure out a reliable solution.

Reading stories of people getting stuck unable to open their vehicles or other impacts is whats making me rethink if this is the right time to jump in on ev vehicles. We have 2 young kids and often go on road trips to far places. Getting stuck in a remote place is worst case scenario when you have young kids.

What are your thoughts on this issue with 12v battery and ICCU failures?

Edit: Intention of my question was not to take pot shot on any brand or ev vehicles in general. Its just to get myself a clear understanding of why is this such an issue which often leads to car being towed to service center. By saying ""most brands"", I am not saying all brands but just that a significant number of brands are either having this or have had this."

Buyer Beware KIA EV9
This is just my opinion and my experience, but I’ve seen similar stories all over the owners groups. If you are looking at purchasing an EV9 you need to understand that if any problems arise with the electrical or battery system you are pretty much out of a car for 6-12 months. KIA dealers apparently do not have the expertise to work on these systems and a KIA corporate technician must be flown in to diagnose and do the work on these. We’ve currently been waiting for 2 months for a technician to just  come out and diagnose a battery issue. We’re not even to the point where we are waiting on parts, we don’t even know what exactly is wrong yet. 

They gave us a loaner after we made a stink but typical KIA dealer tried to say they didn’t have one at first. I’ve seen posts where people are waiting 9+ months for their cars to be fixed and turns due to shortage of qualified labor and parts. 

When it works, the EV9 is a great car for the price. Just know that if any serious problems arise it will be an unreasonably long and frustrating process to fix. "

How do you get your balance refunded from Shell Recharge? (The old app)
**Resolved:** Called the support phone number from the app. They were able to add my credit card and issue a refund. Just waiting on that money back now...

**Update(8 days later):** They sent the refund to the card they manually added to my account. 

\-----------------------------------

So back in 2023, I rented a Bolt EV when I was visiting LA. Ended up making a Shell Recharge account for a charger that I wanted to use and they automatically loaded $10. Turns out, the charger in question (it was located on Vine St near the Walk of Fame), was broken, so I never really got to use that balance (I plugged the car in but the charging never started and was stuck at 0).

Fast forward to today. I rent a car using those ""Mystery car"" deals. Turns out it's a Kona EV. Great, I can now finally use up that $10 balance right? Unfortunately I didn't get the memo and found out that Shell Recharge was getting discontinued. I assumed that since the app was still working, I'd still be able to use the chargers I had access to. Well, these chargers didn't work either lol. They showed up in the old app but they showed as 'offline'.

Looking through couple posts here on the sub, seems like people could get their balance refunded if they have a card added to their account and then deleted their account. Problem is, I don't have a card added. I must have deleted it after I couldn't use that charger in LA after loading the $10 balance. When I try to add a card (same one I used to load that $10 balance), it keeps saying that adding a payment method is not supported.

Anyone have an idea or experience getting their wallet balance refunded in a similar situation? Thanks!"

Knee pain with new car
I recently bought a 23 Bolt EUV LT

After 10-12 days of ownership and driving the car I had no issues. 

Then all of a sudden afterwards on my first drive of the day to the store I noticed a sharp pain above my kneecap after about 1 minute of driving. Top left side of the kneecap (R).  

As I was driving the car more throughout the day my right knee would start to hurt more.  

Now it has been about 3 weeks and I still have pain when I drive.

I take a day off from driving each week and don't leave the house. Gets a little better but still tender. Then when I drive the next day the pain starts up again.  

I drove a Chevy Volt for over 9 years before buying the bolt and never had any issues with my knees.  

Not only have I never had any knee pain or issues while driving ever of any car. But also I have never had an issue with my knees ever in my life, until now. I do not have any preexisting knee conditions.

I keep trying to adjust my seat in different ways, no help. 

I am not using one pedal driving.

Unfortunately I do not have any options on the car. I got the base model, so I don't have ACC. I do a lot of stop and go traffic so it is hard to use regular cruise control.

I went to my GP and he said, you may have to get a new car.

Any advice appreciated."

Hi guys, only had my juicebox for about a year. It's a 40 Amp and plugged into an outlet (capable of 40 amps). 

Recently it's started to only charge 1kwh.
I thought it was an issue with my car and brought it in for unrelated issues. Now the vehicle they lent me has the same issue so I don't think it's my car anymore.

Is this by any chance related to them going out of business? I can very rarely log into the app as is.

My 2021 Taycan transmission failed the 24hour s out of after warranty. Porsche literally ignored their own TSB. No loaner. $320 bill.
Just wanted to share a really frustrating experience.

My Taycan suffered a complete transmission failure less than 24 hours after the factory warranty expired. While braking at a red light, I heard a thump from the rear. Lost access to Reverse and Park, then all gears stopped responding. The car had to be towed.

To make it worse:
	•	The car had less than 50,000 miles
	•	All scheduled maintenance and recalls were performed at authorized Porsche centers
	•	Just one month earlier, I had completed the brake recall and full inspection at a Porsche dealership

I brought it to a Porsche dealer, where they:
	•	Charged $320 for diagnosis
	•	Refused to provide a loaner, citing a 3-week waitlist ￼

But this failure exactly matches Porsche TSB #2209 (NHTSA ID 10210797) — which clearly says:
	•	“Do not attempt to diagnose.”
	•	“Provide a Porsche Mobility loaner vehicle.”

I even sent them the TSB. Their reply:

“We have all those bulletins… but we follow our own diagnostic procedure.”

So they admitted they knew about the TSB — and still ignored it.

As a foreigner living in the U.S., not having a car is a huge problem. This feels like a textbook example of a known issue being ignored the moment warranty ends. Has anyone else had similar issues?"

Audi Q6 e-tron + Ohme ePod: Issue Charging to 100% Battery Level
I'm experiencing a frustrating charging issue with my new Audi Q6 e-tron and Ohme ePod home charger that I'm hoping someone might have insight on.

## The Issue
When trying to use delayed/scheduled charging with my Ohme ePod charger:
- The charge release button pulses white for about a minute after plugging in
- Then turns solid red
- The Audi app shows: ""A technical error occurred""
- This ONLY happens when I have the battery conservation level set to 100%
- If I set battery conservation to 80%, scheduled charging works perfectly

## Setup Details
- Audi Q6 e-tron (new, had it for about 2 weeks)
- Ohme ePod (untethered) with the Audi's included charging cable
- Ohme settings: Basic setup with Dynamic Charging OFF
- Only ""smart"" feature enabled is Price Cap (set to only charge 2am-9am during my off-peak rate)
- Successfully connected Ohme app to Audi app via Ohme Labs API integration

## What I've Tried
- Both charging sockets on each side of car ❌
- Restarting the car ❌
- Restarting charger (including full power cycle at fuse box for 15+ mins) ❌
- Rebooting charger through the app ❌
- Reset battery conservation setting in app ✅ (temporarily fixed)
- Add/remove charging location and preferred charge time window ✅ (temporarily fixed)

## Odd Behavior
- This all worked perfectly for the first week
- When I reset certain settings in the Audi app (like deleting charging location or resetting battery conservation), it works again temporarily
- It seems like whenever I make changes to settings in the Audi app, it ""resets"" something and works for a while

For now, I've resigned to setting the target charge to 80% and hoping a future software update (either Audi or Ohme) will solve this.

Has anyone else experienced this issue? Any suggestions for consistently charging to 100% without getting errors during scheduled charging? Is there something I might be missing in the settings?

Mokka-e Dead After Software Update – Collision Detection System Fault and Car Won’t Start – Need Advice
Hi everyone,

I’m hoping someone here might be able to help or advise me.

I have a Vauxhall Mokka-e. Recently, I was prompted via the Vauxhall app to complete a software update. I followed the instructions, downloaded the software onto a USB drive, and updated the car. However, during the first download attempt, one of the files became corrupted, and the process was incomplete. I later managed to download and install just the main software update (not the navigation update).

Ever since the update, my car has developed serious problems:

The dashboard displays a “Collision Detection Risk System Fault” warning.
The car does not lock or unlock properly — the hazard lights flash when I press the fob, but the doors don’t respond, and I have to use the manual key.
The car will not start at all — pressing the start button does nothing, and no ignition lights come on.
Before the update, the car worked perfectly without any issues.
At the moment, I have disconnected the 12V battery to try and reset the system, hoping it might recover after reconnecting.
I’m absolutely stuck and very worried that the software update may have bricked the car.

Has anyone experienced something similar with a Mokka-e (or Corsa-e, Peugeot e-208, etc)?
Could the incomplete software upload have caused this?
Is there anything else I can do before going back to Vauxhall?

Any advice or experience would be really appreciated!

Thanks in advance."

EV Charging/Cell Service
Cross posting for greater insight. 
I’m looking at buying my first EV in the next few weeks. Before buying, I decided to test out the EV life by renting one while traveling in San Francisco and Yosemite National Park. Figured a trip in these regions would be a great way to see if it fits me, and it was. Probably not relevant, but the rental was a Kia Niro, nothing fancy. My hotels had EV Chargers, so I was able to charge easily when coming back from whatever adventures. It is my understanding that you don’t really want to run down below 20%, so I stuck to that. There was only one day I ran into a problem… Yosemite has free EV chargers (Rivian), but this newbie EV driver didn’t realize these chargers are sloooooooooow 🐢 af. Plus, there was a connection issue with the Kia car and Rivian charger. So it didn’t stay connected and never got an actual charge. Unfortunately, I didn’t catch this until I had already left it to charge for a few hours. No big deal, I thought, I’ll just hit a regular pay EV charger in the area and have to wait around 30/45 minutes to get a charge. Cell service and internet in Yosemite is spotty, but I was able to locate a few EV charger options. Great! Only not. I get to the charger and the charger can’t communicate with my phone, no service. Tried tap to pay with Apple Pay, phone has no service. Tried tapping my actual card to the charger, nothing, the charger doesn’t seem to have its own internet. I still don’t understand how the charger itself had no service. How does it function for anyone? I tried at least 3 locations, part of nearby hotels or resorts, but still extremely rural and no one was around to ask. After wasting time, daylight, and power, I decided to try and make it back to my hotel and charger. Turned off the radio, turned off climate control, turned down the dashboard lighting. Thankfully, I made it!! 😅 I have no idea what happens if the car runs out of juice or how to get going again. Also, I had no service to call for help. Entirely user error and a lesson learned, the easy way for once. Anyone experience something like this? What can you do in a situation like this?

TLDR: What can you do if there’s no cell service at the EV Charger?"

[MG Marvel R] Does not charge above 40%
Just brought my car to the MG garage. It turns out that my car does not charge above 40% (used different stations, speeds and passes) since a few days. I also checked for charge limit setting: the app says 80% and I will call the garage to check it in the car tomorrow.

Has anyone else had this problem? And what was your solution? The timing is very inconvenient, I was supposed to leave for a car camping holiday tomorrow afternoon. 🫣 The garage will read the data first thing tomorrow morning..."

Our 2024 Ioniq 5 Suddenly Died on the Road — Only Then Did We Learn Hidden Recalls
My husband and I purchased a brand-new 2024 Hyundai Ioniq 5 from OpenRoad Hyundai Richmond on a lease. In the roughly seven months we’ve had the vehicle, we used it primarily for commuting, school runs of our kids, and occasional leisure trips. We drove very carefully as it was my husband's dream car and the car was never in an accident or had any damage during this time.

On **Friday, June 20, 2025**, while my husband was driving, the car suddenly began beeping frantically and showed a “Check electrical system” warning, and told him to pull over. Despite being adequately charged, the car became completely immobilized and stranded him on the road. We had to urgently call the school to inform them of the delayed pickup and scramble to find a friend who could help pick up the kids. Thank goodness the kids were not in the car when it became stranded on the road, as even adults could feel confused and anxious in that situation—let alone young children.

After researching online, we found that many Hyundai owners had reported experiencing similar problems. That night, my husband had to call a tow truck to bring the car back home. Even after charging it overnight, the vehicle remained completely dead/non-functional.

On **Saturday, June 21, 2025**, we had the vehicle towed to the OpenRoad Hyundai Richmond. Later that day, a representative from the service department called my husband to inform him that our car was subject to **two** recalls. We were genuinely shocked—this was the first time we had heard of any recall affecting our car. We received recall mails when we had other cars, but we never received any recall mail notification from Hyundai. We later found out both recalls were related to the ICCU (Integrated Charging Control Unit) issue.

At no point during the purchase process did anyone from the sales department inform us of an active recall—Transport Canada Recall #2024-174—issued in March 2024 regarding the ICCU issue affecting the 2024 Ioniq 5 and other Hyundai models. We were also not informed whether the ICCU issue had been addressed or repaired on our specific vehicle prior to the sale.

Had we been made aware of any of this information, we would never have agreed to lease the vehicle, as no consumer would knowingly choose a car with a known risk of becoming unpredictably immobilized on the road.

Upon further research, we discovered the first recall (Transport Canada #2024-174) was published on **March 15, 2024** on Transport Canada’s website, and the second (Recall #2024-701) on **November 18, 2024**. Both address the same ICCU defect, with the second recall replacing the first as it required to recall more models of Hyundai cars. Both recalls address essentially the same issue, and the second recall specifically states: *""Vehicles that were repaired under \[recall #2024-174\] also require this repair.""* We question whether the initial recall repair was truly effective. If it was, why would a second recall be issued just a few months later, requiring even previously repaired vehicles to undergo additional repairs for the same issue? According to experiences shared by other owners online, some have undergone multiple repairs due to the persistent nature of the problem, and some in the United States have pursued vehicle buybacks under lemon law provisions.

As the recall notice warns of *“there could be a loss of power to the wheels.”* This is clearly a **serious safety issue**, not a cosmetic or minor defect that might be acceptable to overlook if not disclosed upfront. Although the car was new at the time of purchase, the existence of an active recall concerning a serious safety issue—**which was not disclosed to us**—would have made it clear that the ICCU defect was a known and recognized problem. Had we been informed, we would have understood that it posed a significant risk to our family’s safety.

While the exact timing of the car becoming immobilized may have been unpredictable, the likelihood of it happening was high, as damage to the 12V battery can develop over time. Unfortunately, it did happen—and it has placed us in a difficult and stressful situation.

We would like to give the dealership the benefit of the doubt and hope that they inspected our vehicle with full awareness of the March recall and addressed any issues that may have been identified. If the dealership did perform any inspection or repairs prior to the sale, we would greatly appreciate receiving documentation confirming that this work was completed.

However, to date, we have not been provided with any records or evidence of such an inspection. If any repair was conducted, it should have been documented as part of the vehicle’s service or delivery history. We are genuinely interested in understanding how Recall #2024-174 was handled by the manufacturer or dealership with respect to our specific vehicle. Was there a process in place to ensure the vehicle’s safety before it was handed over to us—particularly given that an active recall was affecting other identical models on the market at the time?

If the manufacturer or dealership had not inspected or resolved the issue prior to our purchase—or if they were under no legal obligation to disclose the recall information before the sale—then at the very least, we should have been informed of the active recall **immediately after** the purchase, especially since Recall #2024-174 was still active at the time and there is no indication that any prior work had been done on our vehicle.

Had we been notified even the following day, we would have had an opportunity to consider the implications and potentially exit the lease agreement, as there is a one full business day “cooling-off” period in place for such decisions.

However, despite multiple in-person interactions during and after the purchase, **no one informed us of the recall**. Some might argue that a brand-new car shouldn't require a recall notice—but it’s widely understood that when a model is recalled, **every vehicle of that model is included**, regardless of whether it is one day or one year old.

Where is the cutoff for deciding how old a car must be—or how long it must have been owned—to qualify for recall notification? Who determines which vehicles should be covered and which should not? Is there any meaningful difference between a car that is 99 days old versus one that is 100 days old? Or between a car purchased yesterday versus one purchased a year ago?

Who made the decision not to notify us of Recall #2024-174, which had been active for six months prior to our purchase? And if it was inspected/fixed according to the recall regulation, why was no documentation provided to confirm that the issue had been addressed or resolved beforehand?

Can it truly be argued, with confidence, that a newly purchased car is exempt from recall responsibilities? What breakdown in the process led to us not being notified of the recall information in a timely manner?

We also want to emphasize the potential danger this ICCU defect poses. We recently took a family trip to Squamish using the Sea-to-Sky Highway. Thinking back, we are horrified by the thought of this issue occurring while driving on that highway—with children in the car. Some sections of that route have no shoulders or safe areas to pull over. We can’t imagine how terrifying and dangerous it would have been if the vehicle had suddenly demanded to be pulled over while we were on a narrow, high-speed stretch of road. This situation could have led to a serious accident or exposed our family to significant danger.

Further, the November 2024 recall states:

“Hyundai will notify owners by mail and advise you to take your vehicle to a dealership to update the vehicle software.”

To date, we have **never** received any recall notification from Hyundai by mail. Some may say the Canada Post strike in late 2024 as a reason, but that ended in December. It has now been six months, and we still have not received any mails regarding the recall. With all the different brands of cars we had before we received mail notification.

Additional incidents have further eroded our trust in both Hyundai and the dealership. After the car was dropped off on Saturday, a staff member from the service department sent my husband a video showing work being performed on a vehicle they claimed was ours. However, it was **not our car**. This raised our concerns about whether our vehicle was correctly registered and if our personal data could be at risk due to a mix-up in vehicle identification. We wonder if the other customer knew about that incident or if there were other information mistakenly and carelessly handled?

What upsets us more was that when we visited the dealership on **Sunday, June 22, 2025**, we found our car sitting **unlocked** in the outdoor parking lot with the doorhandles poking open. The service department was closed that day, and no work was in process on the vehicle. This careless handling left the vehicle vulnerable to theft or tampering. Our children had left money and personal items inside the car and our insurance documents are in the car. While we understand that cars may be unlocked during servicing for convenience, there is no justification for leaving a customer’s vehicle unsecured on a day when no service staff are present. Who would take responsibility if confidential documents were stolen? The car appeared to have sat there **unlocked overnight**—who knows what may have happened in that time?

Will we ever see high range EVs with small screens
Right now with EVs and 2020s cars in general, they all have really large screens, even the ones with physical HVAC controls like the Honda Prolouge. The new Nissan leaf overall looks pretty cool, my only problem with it is, it has the same style screen that the BMW i4 I rented a while back that gave me eyestrain. 

The only solution for people who have to sit at a computer screen all day and/or are PWM sensitive is to drive a car from the 2000s to maybe early 2010s. Because cars from that era didnt have screens or at least only had small screens that can be covered up if you absolutely needed to, too give your eyes a break from computer screens. My smartphone gives me the most eyestrain because it uses PWM, and even low end phones have it now since most models have OLEDs now.

I know there is the Slate truck coming out, but the only problem with it (beyond it not having power windows, speakers, a speaker cut out and double din slot) is that it doesn't have enough usable range for someone without home charging. Will we eventually see EVs with smaller screens in the future that have 300+ miles of range? "

Followup for anyone curious: I pulled off an exchange with the AC only 2019 Bolt I just purchased
For future reference of Bolt owners who end up with the same AC only problem, and for anyone who thought it couldn't be done. They (sort of) owned up to having sold me a misrepresented vehicle after telling me it had fast charging. They claim that I purchased the only Bolt on their lot that didn't have DC and that they didn't know it existed. Just goes to show how little dealerships know about their cars. 
The exchange is for a 2017 Bolt with the same battery age (2021 recall), even lower mileage somehow, and (critically) FUCKIN DC!!! Absolutely worth it for my peace of mind. 
Bonus is that I don't have to return the NACS adapter after all :) "

Why this subreddit is so optimistic about EVs?

I know this is subreddit is about electric vehicles, but why are you so optimistic about them? l'm somewhat interested in topic, but I won't believe in electric cars success. live in Russia, there is no electric vehicle
sales (except electric buses, which is a large thing here).
I mean really no sales. At this point there's no point even talking about sales, where entire park of passenger electric cars is less than 40,000 units. Yearly sales of cars are about 1,5 million and there's about 55 million registered active cars in Russia. So to make electric cars like 10% of Russian cars fleet it require 30-40% of EVs sold for 10 years, which is questionable at best.
Electric cars only work for wealthy countries with
suburban homes, that's it. If you live in cramped 20 store apartment buildings without dedicated parking lot this is just impossible. Do you really expect people to drive somewhere and and charge car for hours? Typical Russian electric car like evolute x pro has consumer characteristics of a Renault Logan or something like that. But it's cost 2.5 times more than it's petrol counterpart. Why do you telling me that electric cars are cheap? They aren't. Electric cars are heavier than it's petrol counterparts, and this leads to some problems. They require more powerful engine to comparing petrol car, so they have 30-50% higher import and transport tax compared to petrol cars (in Russia cars are taxed only by raw engine power no matter of engine type) Because of being heavier electric cars have bad snow and off-road performance. Winter performance is another thing, especially when it's below -30C.


 You may suggest China, but it's government regulation and help that makes all the sales.

Problem with EV connect
Had a recent issue with EV connect. Tried to charge at one of their public stations on May 17 2025. 

Even with contacting customer service and attempting 3 different charging sessions was unable to charge. 

Each session put a 25 dollar hold on my credit card. Two of these holds released and one was billed.

I’ve contacted EV connect sent in a screenshot of the erroneous charge. And still I have not received a refund or an explanation. I did not receive anything for my money. My charge history demonstrates this fact.

Has anyone experienced a similar problem with this company? This was my first and last time using them. 

I’m currently disputing this through the bank. But truly I thought the company would resolve it or at least respond with their determination of the outcome "

Smart plug for Level 1 EVSE
So, I recently upgrade from a Chrysler Pacifica Hybrid (which is currently sitting at a dealer waiting on Chrysler to approve them to drive it all day to figure out what's wrong with it - yes, I have filed an arbitration claim) to a Honda Clarity. The problem with the Clarity is that the charging timer only starts charging if it's plugged in when it reaches the start time. So, I'd like to get a smart plug to turn the charger on (and also to track my electricity usage.) So, any suggestions as to a smart plug that can deal with 12 amps at 120 V for 12 hours without catching on fire? Also, I park outside, so the plug needs to be waterproof.

EDIT for posterity's sake: OK, I ended up buying the WLPP01 outdoor smart plug. It's been working very well. It was a bit finicky to set up (only works with 2.4 GHz wifi, so I had to switch my phone to that to set it up), but I like it. It has electric usage tracking in the app, and it can charge all night without catching fire. The usage graphs reset every day, week, and month, but I can screenshot it to record it."

What’s the best app for tracking every charging session.
So I have a Kia EV9.  I have a charger at home (cheap DecoHome charger that I got for free…doesn’t even have an app).  And I charge for free at work.  Sometimes I charge at EA or ChargePoint on the road but rarely.

I’m trying to find one app that syncs to the car and records every charging session.

The Kia app doesn’t as far as I can tell…but it should. The car must have the data.

I have all the apps for other networks but they pretty much only track their sessions.

Does anyone know an app which does this?

I heard EEVEE does but it doesn’t work on Kia.

I know I don’t NEED this info but I’m kinda data geek and love tracking stuff.

Plus…I LOVE my Silver Ivory 2004 Land EV9.  Zero problems.  Six months in."

Question about Old batteries
I wonder how old batteries will last. I know about degradation and that older batteries hold less charge, but im more interested in old batteries that become unstable and risk of explosion/fire. I know theres not much data about this, but there are alot of examples of old phone/computer batteries becoming unstable and a hazard. 
Is this only a problem if the batteries ”dies” and loses charge completly? Can this be avoided by keeping the battery charged? Does all li-ion batteries eventually become unstable and dangerous when they get old? Isnt this going to become a huge concern with all the phone/computer/cars/e-bike batteries out in the world?"

How does sitting in bumper to bumper traffic effect EV range?
Thinking about replacing my ICE with an EV this summer but the one thing on my mind was traffic.

Once a month or so, I have to commute into midtown Manhattan by car. It's a 20 mile drive on a map but if the stars misalign and there's an accident in the morning or something stops me from leaving early in the afternoon, can easily take 2-2.5 hours each way nearly all of which is just in gridlock traffic.

Some of the cars on my consideration list are getting some flak for having short range, which isn't a problem in my daily life (seriously, my current lease is from 2022 and has 5k miles on it), but I was curious how EV range would be effected by a low mileage drive that still takes like two and a half hours on the road (maybe even 5 hours if you want to consider the round trip, since I can't charge my car at the garage near my office)."

My modded razor mx650 won’t go more than 4 miles and turns off randomly
I have a modded razer mx650 with a 2000 watt motor and a 48 volt battery and it turns off randomly while I'm driving. I do also have a different throttle with a key.it is a 3 speed throttle with a battery indicator. It should go much farther than 3-4 miles. It is not dead because once I plug it back in, even for a second, it will run again but only for 2 minutes. I know that at the start it is fully charged because the charger has a red and green light indicating if it is charged. The battery is also quite large and should not be dying (if it is) that quickly. The battery is not old, this started happening about 9 months ago and we've replaced the battery since then.

Electrify America App Oops and not recognizing charge plan
I’m on a long distance trip. I can’t get my EA account to work.  It has worked fine on previous trips.  I have plenty in my EA balance available for charging. 

Failed charging sessions this week were in:  Fincastle VA, Wytheville VA ,Asheville NC, and East Point GA

Yesterday it had the “oops” message when I had a good cell signal.  I had to use a credit card.

Today it didn’t have that error but wouldn’t recognize my selection of a payment plan. That stopped me from being able to choose a charger and get charging.  I had to use a credit card. The card worked at all the above locations.  However, I wasn't able to get the EA+ discount charging rate.

How can I get my EA account working again?  I tried deleting it and reinstalling.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

UPDATE 1:

Thanks to all for your suggestions.

Failed charging sessions Day 3: Mobile AL.  Same pattern, but some progress!

Since the other passengers went on a walk, I settled down in the car to call EA support while it was credit-card charging. I got somebody quickly. He couldn't find my account! I gave him a session ID from March and he found me that way.  He told me to call them for a remote start next time I had the problem.  I told him I don't want to have to do that since sometimes you guys are hard to get.  He was OK wilth me stopping my credit card session and have him do a remote start.  THAT WORKED!   He agreed to pass this up the chain for review.

Another success (of a sort): Soon after I posted this message, I sent something simiilar to the EA support email ([support@electrifyamerica.com](mailto:support@electrifyamerica.com))  They responded pretty quickly (17 hours) and asked for details about my phone, current operating system, and EA app version.  The remote start person asked for those items.  I supplied all that as well as some of the details I mention above.

I've been using EA without trouble for a long time.  This looks to me like something got messed up in their database regarding my account.

\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*\*

UPDATE 2:

It started working correctly again on 5/17.  Np answers regarding what the fix was.  All my charging sessions on the way back to DC were fast and started up easily. "

How do you get your balance refunded from Shell Recharge? (The old app)
**Resolved:** Called the support phone number from the app. They were able to add my credit card and issue a refund. Just waiting on that money back now...

**Update(8 days later):** They sent the refund to the card they manually added to my account. 

\-----------------------------------

So back in 2023, I rented a Bolt EV when I was visiting LA. Ended up making a Shell Recharge account for a charger that I wanted to use and they automatically loaded $10. Turns out, the charger in question (it was located on Vine St near the Walk of Fame), was broken, so I never really got to use that balance (I plugged the car in but the charging never started and was stuck at 0).

Fast forward to today. I rent a car using those ""Mystery car"" deals. Turns out it's a Kona EV. Great, I can now finally use up that $10 balance right? Unfortunately I didn't get the memo and found out that Shell Recharge was getting discontinued. I assumed that since the app was still working, I'd still be able to use the chargers I had access to. Well, these chargers didn't work either lol. They showed up in the old app but they showed as 'offline'.

Looking through couple posts here on the sub, seems like people could get their balance refunded if they have a card added to their account and then deleted their account. Problem is, I don't have a card added. I must have deleted it after I couldn't use that charger in LA after loading the $10 balance. When I try to add a card (same one I used to load that $10 balance), it keeps saying that adding a payment method is not supported.

Anyone have an idea or experience getting their wallet balance refunded in a similar situation? Thanks!"

Longer cords at existing superchargers: is this happening?

I have heard rumors that longer cords might be coming to existing superchargers in order to accommodate vehicles that have NACS adapters but don't have the charge port in a convenient spot, resulting in the famous ""block two spots"" problem.

My 2021 Taycan transmission failed the 24hour s out of after warranty. Porsche literally ignored their own TSB. No loaner. $320 bill.
Just wanted to share a really frustrating experience.

My Taycan suffered a complete transmission failure less than 24 hours after the factory warranty expired. While braking at a red light, I heard a thump from the rear. Lost access to Reverse and Park, then all gears stopped responding. The car had to be towed.

To make it worse:
	•	The car had less than 50,000 miles
	•	All scheduled maintenance and recalls were performed at authorized Porsche centers
	•	Just one month earlier, I had completed the brake recall and full inspection at a Porsche dealership

I brought it to a Porsche dealer, where they:
	•	Charged $320 for diagnosis
	•	Refused to provide a loaner, citing a 3-week waitlist ￼

But this failure exactly matches Porsche TSB #2209 (NHTSA ID 10210797) — which clearly says:
	•	“Do not attempt to diagnose.”
	•	“Provide a Porsche Mobility loaner vehicle.”

I even sent them the TSB. Their reply:

“We have all those bulletins… but we follow our own diagnostic procedure.”

So they admitted they knew about the TSB — and still ignored it.

As a foreigner living in the U.S., not having a car is a huge problem. This feels like a textbook example of a known issue being ignored the moment warranty ends. Has anyone else had similar issues?"

2024 Acura ZDX vs. 2021 Tesla Model Y
# Two Great EV's

*Processing img 8elzgzsggtxe1...*

After saying goodbye to my second Nissan LEAF (2022 SV model), our family now owns two premium electric SUV's. Coming from the compact Nissan LEAF, the 2024 Acura ZDX feels cavernous on the inside, and bus-like on the outside. I'm excited to get into something larger, more luxurious, and with more range than my LEAF's 135 miles. Because Acura has had trouble selling the ZDX A-Spec AWD for close to $70,000 US, there are excellent lease deals to be had when one includes federal rebates and manufacturer/dealer incentives.

Having driven the 2021 Model Y Long Range for 4 years, I can give an honest review of its highlights and its shortcomings. Only having driven the 2024 ZDX A-Spec AWD 1,100 miles over a month, my opinions on the car could change, but I feel confident in my current thoughts on this vehicle. It is my daily-driver, and I've taken it on an 800-mile road trip.

# Exterior Styling & Size

The styling of the ZDX is more ""regular long SUV"" and less ""futuristic spaceship."" Although manufactured by GM, the styling cues are decidedly Acura. At the front of the vehicle, I love the zig-zag signature lights / turn signals, and the jewel-eye LED projector lamps give an upscale look. The Acura diamond non-grill is a nice Acura touch, especially as the outline of it is illuminated. Is this necessary? No. Is it cool? Sure. I love the 3 creases in the hood, as it gives the car some character, and it reminds me of vintage muscle cars. Around the sides of the vehicle, the silver accent on the lower part of the car is a nice touch. The A-Spec has a body-colored roof and pillars, which I actually prefer to the black of the Type-S. I don't mind the chrome trim on the sides of the car, though some have likened it to hearse. The shelf-like rear end is, well, interesting. It's a bit different than most SUV's. I don't like or dislike it. The 20-inch wheels and beefy tires are a good fit for the size of the car and wheel-wells. The car is BIG and WIDE. It's possible to park it in small spots, but I'm just waiting for the dings.

When it was released, I really liked the styling of the Model Y. I feel like it's a little dated at this point, but I still prefer it to the updated Juniper. Its smooth curvy shape looks like it slips easily through the air (except for the big flat non-grill in the front). The headlights are a little bubbly, but were kind of futuristic when they were released. Overall, it's a no-frills coupe-like SUV, and I'm for it. The 19-inch wheels look classy, and fit the car well. The Model Y is a little narrower and shorter than the ZDX, which makes it easier to park.

I don't mind the styling of either vehicle, but if I had to choose one, the ZDX gets my vote.

# Interior Styling & Comfort

The biggest gripe of many car reviewers is that the interior isn't Acura enough because it's made by GM. I haven't ever owned a GM *or* Acura vehicle before, so this doesn't bother me one bit. Before the ZDX, the Model Y was the most upscale vehicle I've ever owned/leased. However, I love the ZDX's interior. The power seats are well-crafted with three different textiles and the soft-touch leather trimmed panels with red stitching are beautiful. I like the aluminum and chrome accents throughout the dash and the doors, but what I REALLY appreciate is the lack of piano-black plastic (except for the climate buttons). I don't know why manufacturers keep using this - it looks cheap and it is impossible to keep clean. The steering wheel is beefy with a little softness under the leather, and the buttons on the wheel are *actual buttons* and not capacitive fake buttons. I appreciate having buttons and dials for some of the more regularly used functions - volume, climate, wipers, ""gauge cluster"" selection. The two screens are not as massive as the one in the Model Y, but I appreciate having a programmable screen behind the steering wheel.

The seats are some of the most comfortable I've sat in, and the side bolstering is appreciated. Heated and cooled front seats are welcomed and work well. I do wish that the rear seats also offered the same. A $70,000 car shouldn't be missing this. In addition, there is no third zone for climate control. The Model Y offers these comforts for rear passengers for $20,000 less. The ""old-school"" panoramic moon roof offers a great view of the sky/stars, and opens fully half-way. The motorized cover is a must for bright, sunny days. Our entire interior, ceiling to floor, is dark. This makes the car feel less than airy, but I don't mind it. Both my LEAF and the Model Y have dark interior but the pillars and ceilings are tan.

When Tesla released the Model 3 and Model Y, they tried to convince the public that minimalism was the new luxury and not simply a cost-saving measure. The low dash, large windows, and lack of ""stuff"" does make the car seem futuristic. Although the interior uses vegan leather (plastic), it's very comfortable, and I appreciate the soft-touch arm rests, center console, and steering wheel. There's no piano black plastic here, either, thank goodness. The huge touchscreen is easy to access, though many functions are buried in multiple menus. I find that I take my eyes away from the road more often in the Tesla than the Acura to find functions.

I like using the Android Automotive ecosystem in the Acura, and rarely connect my phone for Android Auto. I simply enter my Google account info, and apps sync nicely. However, if I wanted to, the ZDX offers wireless Android Auto and Apple CarPlay, unlike the Tesla.

I find the seats in the Model Y very comfortable, though they don't feel quite as wide as in the ZDX. The heated front and rear seats work very well, as they should in a car around the $50,000 mark. I love the view of the glass roof, but on hot summer days, a separate manual shade is required.

**Comfort** \- ZDX

Being a professional musician, I love a great sound system. The sound in both the Model Y and in the ZDX is great. Acura touts its Bang & Olufsen 18-speaker system, and it has every right to. The highs are crisp without being hyped, and the lows are deep and rich. The immersive setting does make it feel like you're in the middle of a concert. The Model Y offers a 13-speaker system which has very balanced tones from high to low with excellent sound immersion when the setting is turned up. At loud volumes, both systems deliver clear music with ""feel it in your back"" bass.

**Sound System** \- Tie

Space-wise, the ZDX is cavernous. I am 5'9"", and there is a great amount of legroom in the front and rear seats. The family fits in this car with loads of room to spare. The Model Y also has loads of legroom and headroom, both in the front and in the rear seats. The one area in the space category where the Model Y shines is storage. The trunk is similar in size to the ZDX, but the UNDER trunk storage is much larger than in the ZDX. In addition, the ZDX, despite it's *huge* hood, has no front trunk storage. In my mind, this is simply poor engineering. The designers at GM could have made this work.

**Space** \- Model Y

# Driving

This is where the two vehicles differ the most, in my mind. Going back and forth between the two cars offers two somewhat opposing driving experiences, despite both cars having high torque electric motors. The Tesla offers a fuller view of the road because the hood slopes down away from the windshield. The ZDX's hood is more horizontal, so I get a clear view of the hood at all times. In addition, the windshield on the Acura seems to be shorter top to bottom, so the view is not quite as full. Both cars offer blind spot detection but in different ways. I prefer the ZDX's blinking lights on the actual mirrors, but the Tesla's screen-based visualization is fine. There is marginally better rear visibility on the ZDX, but I would place both in the ""meh"" category.

**Road view** \- Model Y

Driving the Model Y feels very solid and dialed in. The road feel is high, and the steering is tight. The car responds quickly to both acceleration and braking, and there is little body roll. I appreciate that I can control how quickly the motor responds to the accelerator pedal. It helps to save tires a bit. The ZDX is a more muted driving experience. I can feel the road, but the suspension soaks up smaller bumps and rough patches. The steering tightness can be changed, but even on the sportier mode, there is not much feel in the wheel. Despite its 3-ton weight, the car stays planted well, even when taking corners. The acceleration in sport mode is not quite as peppy as the Model Y, but it's still plenty fast. The only time I feel the weight of the ZDX is when I stop hard. The thing bounces frontward and backward after coming to a rest.

For longer trips, I much prefer the comfort of the Acura ZDX. Its sound dampening far surpasses the Model Y, and its smoothness is on another level. For fun jetting around town or spirited driving, the Model Y wins out, though the ZDX holds its own.

**Trips / Commuting** \- ZDX  
**Active Driving** \- Model Y (slightly)

The Tesla Model Y offers lane centering and traffic-aware cruise control standard. Why Acura only offers SuperCruise on their top spec ZDX is beyond me. The Bolt EUV has it. Why not Acura? The Acura's lane-keep assist is just plain bad and ping pongs me from one side of the lane to the other. I usually just keep it off. Any premium or luxury brand needs to offer centering standard and not just at their most expensive levels.

**Driver Assistance** \- Model Y

*Processing img v6kwgvnbstxe1...*

# Charging / Battery Features

The ZDX and the Model Y Long Range both offer large batteries with good range. Both models offer the option to limit charging to a certain percentage and to specific times of day. Both models can do road trips with planning. Both vehicles can use level 1 or level 2 charging easily.

On long trips, the Tesla Model Y is limited to Tesla's supercharger and destination charger network unless the owner has a CCS-NACS converter. The good part is that this network is robust and well cared for. Frankly, it just works. Our family has taken numerous road trips in our Model Y and have never had a problem. The nav software figures out the route, where we charge, how long we charge, and we just do it. 

Our family has taken only one road trip in our ZDX, and it was fine.... because we used Tesla's Supercharger. The ZDX does not support Tesla's NACS charging standard natively. For DC fast charging, it uses CCS1 type plugs which can be found on Electrify America, EVGo, Chargepoint, and other charging networks. These networks are not as robust and not as well maintained as Tesla's. The good news is that a NACS to CCS adapter can be found for under $200. Simply use the Tesla app and list your car as a Cadillac Lyriq, and you can use V3/V4 Tesla Superchargers. Be aware this is not officially supported by Acura/Honda, though the company says they will have official access to Tesla superchargers in June, 2025. I have used EVGo 350kw chargers in our area and they work great. The navigation software will figure out a route including charging, and will even precondition the battery for fast charging, but the built in nav does not factor in Tesla Superchargers. I can't wait for Acura/Honda to gain official access to Tesla superchargers and add the option in the navigation.

Charging speeds also separate these two vehicles. The Model Y can fast charge at up to 250 kW of power. The ZDX has a theoretical maximum charging power of 190 kW, but the charging curve is so steep that the speed will throttle rather quickly, even if you get a full 190 kW at first.

**Charging** \- Model Y

# Quirks and Features

Both the ZDX and Model Y have their quirks.

The placement of the a few of the ZDX's buttons is straight up odd. The drive mode is down by your left knee, along with the electronic parking break. The trunk button is in the pocket of the driver's side door. These seem like after-thoughts in a fairly well thought out car. There also are no physical headlight buttons, but this does not bother me. I generally keep the lights in auto mode, so I rarely have to use the touchscreen to turn the lights on.

The lack of buttons in the Model Y does cause more looking away from the road. Even the dial/buttons on the steering wheel are not labeled, so it takes time to learn the system.

The ZDX obviously knows that a key fob is near, as the lights turn on when I approach. However, I still have to press the unlock button to get in and then press the on button to turn the car on. If it knows I'm near with the key, just unlock and turn on. Why the extra steps?

The Tesla does offer key free entry via your phone, but I find that it randomly won't work. If I have my hands full, I've got to put everything down, fish out my key card, and enter manually.

I'd give the Tesla app a B and the Acura app a C-. Both *can* function correctly, but sometimes won't connect quickly or at all. Both companies could do some upgrading here.

The auto-brights on both cars don't work perfectly, but I would give the edge to the Acura. It more regularly detects when the lights should be on and off.

The lightshow and other ""toy box"" functions on the Tesla are fun. The ZDX doesn't bother with these. Heck, you can't even watch YouTube on Android Automotive when parked. Acura could add some fun stuff with an over-the-air update. They should consider this.

**Lack of Quirks** \- Model Y

# Final Thoughts

I very much enjoy driving both of these vehicles, and would gladly take either out for fun or for a road trip. Day to day, I prefer the feel of the ZDX, with its smooth drive, its quiet interior, and its ""Bang""ing sound system. I do feel that, for a $70,000 vehicle, it lacks some important features, though this can be overlooked for the price of current lease or purchase deals (we're talking $30k-$35k off)."

EV Charging/Cell Service
Cross posting for greater insight. 
I’m looking at buying my first EV in the next few weeks. Before buying, I decided to test out the EV life by renting one while traveling in San Francisco and Yosemite National Park. Figured a trip in these regions would be a great way to see if it fits me, and it was. Probably not relevant, but the rental was a Kia Niro, nothing fancy. My hotels had EV Chargers, so I was able to charge easily when coming back from whatever adventures. It is my understanding that you don’t really want to run down below 20%, so I stuck to that. There was only one day I ran into a problem… Yosemite has free EV chargers (Rivian), but this newbie EV driver didn’t realize these chargers are sloooooooooow 🐢 af. Plus, there was a connection issue with the Kia car and Rivian charger. So it didn’t stay connected and never got an actual charge. Unfortunately, I didn’t catch this until I had already left it to charge for a few hours. No big deal, I thought, I’ll just hit a regular pay EV charger in the area and have to wait around 30/45 minutes to get a charge. Cell service and internet in Yosemite is spotty, but I was able to locate a few EV charger options. Great! Only not. I get to the charger and the charger can’t communicate with my phone, no service. Tried tap to pay with Apple Pay, phone has no service. Tried tapping my actual card to the charger, nothing, the charger doesn’t seem to have its own internet. I still don’t understand how the charger itself had no service. How does it function for anyone? I tried at least 3 locations, part of nearby hotels or resorts, but still extremely rural and no one was around to ask. After wasting time, daylight, and power, I decided to try and make it back to my hotel and charger. Turned off the radio, turned off climate control, turned down the dashboard lighting. Thankfully, I made it!! 😅 I have no idea what happens if the car runs out of juice or how to get going again. Also, I had no service to call for help. Entirely user error and a lesson learned, the easy way for once. Anyone experience something like this? What can you do in a situation like this?

TLDR: What can you do if there’s no cell service at the EV Charger?"

My own personal report - first time driving across the country in an EV
Recently I relocated from Northern Virginia to Southern Florida and took a lot of household goods with me, a distance over 1000 miles. My vehicle is a Jaguar I-Pace. I know this is no big deal for some people, but this was my first time ever traveling so far from home with an EV and relying on public chargers. Jaguar does have a tentative deal to use the Tesla network but as far as I know that hasn't happened yet, so I had to use non-Tesla chargers. 

I used **A Better Routeplanner (ABRP)** for the trip. I have mixed feelings about this app. Yes, it's a wonderful app and I will use it again. It planned the trip accurately and gives you lots of options to help in planning (it did underestimate my battery consumption by about 10% or so, but that was probably because the car was heavier than I estimated due to my stuff). It found chargers in many places I didn't expect to find chargers, and all of them were working and open to the public.  

But if you use ABRP, I recommend using it on the web site before your trip and printing it out, because once the trip started there were problems. If I kept the app open all the time, it was fine, but sometimes I need to use my phone for other things, or it goes to sleep, gets turned off or whatever. Every time that happened, then ABRP tried to reset the trip and go back to the first stop!!

Or I'll explain it this way. I'm going from city 1 ---> city 2 ---> city 3. I reach city 2, phone is turned off for a bit, I turn it back on, the app reloads my trip plan, and then it tries to send me BACK to city 1 starting the trip all over again! So every time that happened I had to create a new trip on the spot, starting from city 2 or wherever, and then I had to go through all the options and make certain I set the parameters correctly. It was a pain in the ass. 

I made seven charging stops in all. If I was driving an ICE car, I would have made 3 or 4. So basically I'm stopping twice as often when using an EV.  These were the chargers I used, some more than once:

* **Circle K** - this was a pain. I had to download the app, and tried several times to get it working. It was stuck on ""initializing"". I even called their customer service number and got a guy who barely spoke English. I gave up on him, started the process over a couple times, and eventually got it to work. 

* **EV Go** - had to download their app. EV Go worked fine for charging but it stopped charging when I unlocked my car, forcing me to initiate the process all over again. So this is a minor annoyance if I want to leave the car to go to the bathroom or whatever and return again before charging is finished. 

* **Rivian Adventure Network** - I was worried about this, as I was very low on charge, and was concerned if it will work with non-Rivians. But in fact this was the best charger I came across. I didn't have to download an app! I could just directly use my credit card just like with a regular gasoline pump. All chargers should be like this. 

* **FPL EVolution** - needed the app, but at least I could sign in with Google instead of creating a new account. Worked fine. 

* **Blink Charging** - again, needed the app. This one worked eventually but it was frustrating because you first have to log into the app, then select your location, then start the charging from the app. But that means you have to choose charger 1, 2, 3, or 4. But how do I know which one is 1, 2, 3, or 4?? They weren't labeled in any obvious way. I looked all around the chargers, behind them, I couldn't find any number. So I had to guess, and guessed it right on my 2nd try. 


Two overall observations: 

1. I had to constantly download apps!! I now have 7 apps on my phone just for chargers. This is ridiculous. What if I didn't have a cell signal and a data plan to download the app on the spot? And I have some older relatives who don't have smartphones and don't know how to use apps. How would they ever charge their EV? There has to be a better way of doing this. 

2. I use a J1772/CCS plug but couldn't help notice that nearly every charging station had a CHAdeMO outlet. I thought that system was basically extinct, but there still is a lot of support for it.


**EDIT**: I forgot to add that leaving with a fully charged battery, the total cost of my trip was $131.81. I did some quick math, and I figure that if I drove a similar luxury ICE car, it would have been about double that."
166,2025-04-24 09:33:25,"electricvehicles
How is level 2 charging still so sparse?
SoCal - temporarily without home charging for two weeks. 

No problem, I'll use the J1772 chargers when I go to the grocery store, gym, etc.

lol nope. 75% of the parking lots and garages in Los Angeles have no charging. And the ones that do have two stations - one is broken, and the other is always occupied. 

Wild that public charging is still so bad in 2025. Especially in California. "

4th BEV & def my favorite
This is my fourth EV, and honestly, it’s probably the one I’ve liked the most. I’ve been into electric vehicles for a while, and the Charger feels like the first one that actually feels like a car with an electric powertrain, not just an EV designed for efficiency. 


I know this car is controversial because of the electric powertrain but the high output hurricane i6 was announced when the EV was announced. I say that to answer the question that I see a lot which is “who’s this car for?” ME. 

Growing up, I played Need for Speed and Midnight Club, printing out pictures of Lamborghinis, Corvettes, and Ferraris, old muscle cars and stapling them together into a flipbook. I loved hot wheels, I just loved cars. My first car didn’t come until I got to my first duty station, a 2007 Ford Edge SEL lmao (no credit and on a budget), Since then, I’ve owned a few Toyotas, Honda, ram and as I started to make more money EVs started really rolling out. 


I still remember test driving an EV for the first time, just smiling the entire drive, and so that’s what I ended up buying, got a house and charger installed and never really looked back. 


My first EV was a Mustang Mach-E GT. It was fun when it worked, but it had the well-known HVJB issue that hit a lot of early builds. I eventually traded it in because of that.


After that, I had a 2022 Tesla Model Y, which I enjoyed a lot from a tech perspective but Elon.. so I took advantage  of Ford’s aggressive rebates on the F-150 Lightning and got that. The Lightning was smooth and well put together. My only real complaint was the tech feeling like a downgrade after coming from Tesla. Also the steering wheel has like 18 buttons but not a pause / play button for your music, why ford?


The older I get the more I appreciate convenience and having an EV charger at home just makes car ownership better. So when Dodge announced the charger I was immediately interested . I’ve been wishing for a two-door EV for a long time, and I just thought this one looked great, inside and out. Hated the interior of the old charger / challengers. 


Things I Really Like


Interior: spacious and clean, the ambient lighting is nice af. 


Fratzonic Exhaust: I know this one’s hit or miss, but I actually like it. Whether it’s just sitting idle or when you shut it down, you can feel the rumble. The startup and shutdown sounds make you smirk the first time you hear it, they sound wild, especially in a closed garage. The Mach E had a fake exhaust sound inside the car and it sounded atrocious. It’s also a nice change of pace from silence.


Overall Feel: This is easily the best-looking car  (ICE / EV) I’ve owned. Most EVs go for rounded, aero designs, which some look good, don’t get me wrong but I like that this car doesn’t give that. The proportions of the vehicle look a little off from the side but it’s doesn’t bother me that much. 


I drove 650 miles to buy this car. On the way there, I was in my Lightning, which had Apple Maps route planning and access to both Tesla Superchargers. Everything went smoothly.


On the return trip in the Charger, no Supercharger access and no built-in Apple Maps routing. I had to manually plan my stops between chargers, but it worked out fine. All the stations I used were reliable, and I made it back without issues.

Probably be my biggest suggestion to dodge / stellantis, get customers access to the Tesla charging network.

Also, figure out how to get the new charger added into Apple Maps. I’ve already submitted a request with Apple. Not sure who initiates that, Apple or manufacture. 


The main problem I’ve had is the 12V battery drain, which seems to be affecting a number of early builds. Mine has already spent a short time at the dealership because of it. Stellantis is supposed to be working on a software fix, and once that rolls out, should be problem free, I hope.


Also, Shout out to all the manufactures that haven’t blocked CarPlay. That pay to play is lame. "

I just test-drove a 2025 Model Y Juniper LR in Vienna, Austria: If nothing changes with the ADAS, it's not for me at all.
*Alternate Title: A long & rambly test-drive experience of the 2025 MYLR from someone who barely cares about cars and would prefer not being a beta-tester on public roads.*

# TL;DR:

* The ADAS Experience (as of 16/4/25) is **significantly** worse than in our 2022 MYLR (v2025.8.7).
* Almost as many false positives, but much less manual control/granularity.
* The small creature-comfort-upgrades, while nice (especially the ventilated front seats & electronically folding back seats) do not compensate for the markedly more frustrating ADAS experience.
* Some may like the new suspension but I did not like the floaty/boaty feel.

# Background

There are a lot of things that we like about our current 2022 MYLR. Other EVs that are approximately the same size somehow have less ""usable"" space on the inside (for our needs) - e.g. some (like the ID4) prioritise passenger-space and sacrifice usable trunk space, others (like the Ioniq 5) have a Frunk that isn't partciularly useful, and other still (like the Enyaq) have back seats that don't fold down as flat (or so it was when we were shopping around in 2021). We've already camped in the car twice and loved it. I like how smooth it is to drive, the one-pedal experience is very nicely tuned, and the software is snappy and responsive. It charges fast when it needs to and can drive longer than my lower-back can without a break. I love being able to integrate it with HomeAssistant via TeslaMate & MQTT.

However, the ADAS System's god-awful onslaught of false-positives and its lack of manual-control-granularity is something that I genuinely loathe about Tesla's ADAS Philosophy.

# Complaints with the 2022 MYLR's ADAS:

When using TACC in Vienna (or any other town in Austria, really), the car **constantly** slams on the brakes for vehicles parked on the side of the road, for pedestrians on sidewalks (I've even had it hard-brake & issue a forward collision warning for a jogger on a pedestrian bridge), and a plethora of other random bullshit. This 2022 vehicle that we dropped €60,000 on has a cruise-control system that I find **less trustworthy** than the cruise control system in my second-hand, €5,000 2010 Hyundai i10, simply because it's trying (and spectacularly failing) to be ""smart"".

I was at a service appointment at Tesla today - they wanted to check the car's hardware out because I've been having (inconsistent & hard to reproduce) issues with connectivity (the modems sometimes simply refuse to initialise & I need to steering-wheel-knobs-reset the car), the TACC system is frustrating at best and dangerous at worst, and the speed-limit detection has been either **not improving** or getting significantly worse with each update, making Lane-Keep basically unusable.

For the unaware - at some point, Tesla, in all their infinite wisdom, decided that (when using Lane Keep) it was a good idea to restrict the Cruise Control Set Speed to whatever the car detected the current Speed Limit to be (with an allowance of +10 kmph over that detected limit). So for example, if the car thinks that a 5-lane 130 kmph Autobahn is a 50-zone for whatever reason, then it **may or may not** drop (and restrict) the Cruise Control's set speed to 50 kmph while you're going 130 kmph. I hope I do not need to explain why this (and especially the inconsistency in the car's behaviour) may be a bit of a safety-issue.

Look, I get it - computer vision isn't an easy problem to solve, especially when you're dealing with just one type of sensor and don't even have a proper stereoscopic setup. I don't expect the solution to be on point & I'm not in a rush to have a perfect system. Just give me **the option** to turn said imperfect system off and everyone's happy. You're free to let your systems run in shadow-mode and gather data to train your models and I'll happily test them out when there's a new version. But till it's reliable enough and behaves consistently enough, **let me use normal cruise control** especially in places where **I know** your ADAS currently fails.

I intentionally scheduled my appointment a month from when I opened the ticket and had my issues acknowledged by Tesla. In the mean time, I sent Tesla (at their request) several tens of videos showing instances of each of the issues I was having. The modems not initialising, the incessant false-positives, the completely broken speed-limit detection, the car randomly dropping the Cruise Control Set Speed to some random value with no user input when using Lane-Keep on the Autobahn (sometimes even without the detected speed limit changin), all of it. The Werkstattsleiter wanted to hear about all of this in more detail. We spoke at length and I mentioned how frustrated I am with the system, how disappointed I am that I cannot switch it off, and how I am genuinely thinking of ditching Tesla in general. After hearing me out, he said they would check the hardware to rule any issues out, and that it would take \~less than an hour. I decide to wait (I live \~40 minutes away returning home only to have to come back immediately wasn't ideal). As I had time to kill and as they had a 2025 MYLR (Juniper) on hand, he offered me a test drive claiming that its systems work MUCH better than our 2022 MYLR, and that I might want to check it out before deciding to ""ditch Tesla"".

# The Juniper

Just so we're clear on my perspective when evaluating a vehicle: I genuinely could not care less about what a car looks like from the outside. I'm entirely indifferent towards ""interiors"", ""build quality"", ""panel gaps"", ""speed"" and most of those kinds of things. I drive in chill mode. I do not baby our car. I have a solution for the lack of buttons (thanks, enhauto), and almost literally everything is nicer than my 2010 Hyundai i10. I see our car as a utility. It needs to get me from Point A to Point B, it needs to be able to haul things I want it to haul, and it needs to do what I want it to do without it getting in my way. I am satisfied with all but one aspect of our current car (that does indeed get in my way), and the Juniper is almost functionally identical in most other ways. So, I decided to focus on testing just that one aspect of out.

It's **so much worse** than our 2022 MY. **SO MUCH WORSE.** It's safe to say that I loathe the new implementation of the ADAS significantly more than the one in our car.

# An even more ""all or nothing"" philosophy

In the 2022 MY, when I want to change lanes while using TACC+LaneKeep, I indicate (which reduces the steering-wheel-resistance required to disable LaneKeep), slighty nudge the wheel which deactivates LaneKeep but keeps TACC active (so I maintain my current speed), I move over to the new lane, and then reactivate LaneKeep (by double-pressing the right stalk).

I cannot do this in the Juniper. There is no ""single-click is TACC and double-click is TACC+LaneKeep"" setting anymore. You can either have ""single click toggles TACC"" or you can have ""single-click toggles both TACC+LaneKeep as one package"". There are no inbetweens. You therefore always need to have a foot on the pedal when deactivating LaneKeep or else regen will kick in & you'll start slowing down. Additionally, you now have all of the restrictions that LaneKeep brings with it, meaning you can no longer use ""just"" TACC in situations where some kind of cruise control would be helpful, but LaneKeep isn't available (so almost every single 30 zone & several 50-zones in Vienna & most other Austrian cities/towns/villages). Sure, I can switch the ADAS to TACC-Only mode, but I cannot turn TACC+LaneKeep-mode (they call it ""Autosteer Beta"") on again without first shifting to Park.

This is a straight downgrade in my driving experience.

# And yet, just as many false-positives

Despite the Juniper having an additional front-bumper camera (which I would love to have retrofitted in our car) and the camera feeds having better image quality, Juniper still has just as many false positives. It still hard-slams the brakes for vehicles parked on the side of the road (regardless of whether I'm on TACC or TACC+LaneKeep), it is still very antsy around cyclists that are **inside a cycling lane**, it still cannot consistently & correctly identify speed limits (both cars think 90% of Vienna is a 30-zone), and it still comes to a **complete fucking stop** in the middle of the road when it sees a truck **parked in a clearly demarkated parking spot**. All of these issues are **significantly** worse when using LaneKeep+TACC so when driving our car, I usually just stick to using TACC and activate LaneKeep only on parts of my commute that I know I can trust LaneKeep. But with Juniper, I would not be able to do this.

Another downgrade in my driving experience.

# You will eat your FCWs & you will like them!

Every time I get into our 2022 MYLR, the very first thing I do is pull up the menu, navigate to the ""Autopilot"" section, and swith ""Forward Collision Warning"" and ""Lane Departure Avoidance"" off. Both of these features are beyond broken out here and any time I forget to switch them off, the car is very prompt to show me how much worse my driving experience can be with them switched on. It will yell about most parked vehicles. It will yell about random pedestrians. It will panic about cars waiting to turn on to the main road. It will have a mental breakdown and slam on the brakes for cars trying to merge on to the highway. Several roads here have cycling lanes that ""eat into"" the main lane - the idea is that if there are no cyclists in the cycling lane, cars can drive with their right-wheels in that cycling lane (you effectively pretend it doesn't exist). Some roads don't have a median at all and will have two cycling lanes on each side. The car cannot cope with this. It will screech at me and try to steer me out of the cycling lane unless I turn that damn feature off. I've had situations were it's thrown a lane-departure-warning when I've been trying to turn **with my indicator turned on**. I know several parts of my commute where these situations are very reliably reproducable, so I decided to check how Juniper responds.

It responds in almost exactly the same way.

But now, there's no way to switch ""Forward Collision Warning"" off anymore. 

*What the actual fuck.*

# But you should have tested FSD! It's so much better!!1!1!!1

No. 

Let's ignore the fact that, as of time of writing, it's basically vaporware out here in Europe. I want MORE granularity when it comes to manual-control not LESS. 

I do not mind using my think-noodle. I enjoy using this steering wheel that I paid for, and I do not mind managing distance from vehicles in front of me. Believe it or not, I do like driving. I just want to rest my ankle every now and then, especially when I'm done climbing, bouldering, or snowboarding.

I don't have FSD on my current vehicle. I do not intend to have it on my next vehicle. In fact, I do not even intend to buy EAP.

I literally just want CC, TACC, and LaneKeep, and the option to pick and choose which ones of those I activate depending on my circumstances.

# But... But... Butt... SoFtWaRE UpDAtes!!!1!

Sure. It's possible that some of these downgrades will be fixed via software updates. Tesla even has a mostly-amazing track record of issuing them. They do tend to break things once in a while, but fixes do come around eventually (unless you're the Auto-Wipers). That said, I do not like evaluating products based on the promise of future improvements. I did not evaluate the 2021 MYLR based on it's potential to get software updates when we test drove it (RIP v10) and I see no reason to hold the Juniper to different standards.

Is this unrealisitically pesimistic? Perhaps, perhaps not. I would much rather err on the side of caution, especially knowing that Tesla has, in fact, disabled features via Software in the past (e.g. Radar, 12V Accessory Power, the ability to disable Automatic Emergency Braking when using LaneKeep, etc.). Updates are a double-edged sword. Yes, things *can* get better, but they *can* also get much worse. I would rather evaluate a product as it is as of time of evaluation.

# So then a Tesla isn't for you!1!!!!1!

Yes, I am afraid that, as of time of writing, the Juniper isn't for me. As much as I like the fact that the frunk has a drain port (and all of the use cases I can imagine for it), that my passengers can control the climate & seat heating without having to ask me, that I won't be as sweaty in the summer, and that I can have the back seats lift themselves, having **less** manual control of the ADAS system is an objective downgrade for the way I like to interact with my vehicle.

There are many things I like about the Juniper. The current implementation of the ADAS system is absolutely not one of them and it is for sure a deal-breaker.

By the time our 2022 MYLR kicks the bucket, I genuinely hope something changes. Either in Tesla's willingness to give their users more manual control of the ADAS & so-called ""sAfEtY"" systems, or with how other manufacturers use the space in their similarly sized vehicle offerings."

2025 Cadillac Optiq 70 MPH Highway Range Test: A Little Dissapointing
tl;dr - Cadillac Optiq EPA rated for 302 miles only returns 249 miles in real world test at 70mph.  

The problem here is the EPA ratings.  The only thing that should matter with the published ratings should be exactly what this test did.  An official rating based on mixed testing is not useful as the only time EV range really matters is on road trips at 70mph.  If you are able to charge at home, you're realistically never going over 300 or 250 miles traveling to work or running errands and can just recharge overnight.  The time range REALLY matters is on road trips, and most highway speed limits are between 65 and 75 mph.  Why isn't this the figure that's published as the range? ...or why don't EVs have a city/highway rating like ICE vehicles do?"

Is rebalance battery necessary?
Hi I'm Byd Dolphin user from Thailand. As the topic do you think I need to do rebalance battery every 3-6 months? slow charging from very low percentage ~10% to 100%. (correct me if I'm wrong about rebalance concept) 

The problem is I think it's too risky and painful to do so because I fear that my car will be dead on the road due to depleted battery lol. Thanks"

Wallbox Pulsar Plus stop charging after 20-30 min
Hello everyone,

I've been using a Wallbox for the last 3 years in a Kia EV6, and last week it suddenly stopped the charge after 20-30 min three times a day, making it impossible to charge the car. I've received a car notification saying there was an error related to an external problem or domestic error network (my house had electricity supply that day without any problem). Since that day, the charger has stopped charging after 30 min. I've tried to reload it, disconnect it, do a default reset, and upload the last version, and it doesn't work. Everything in the app works well, and even the LED light in the charger seems fine. Has anybody experienced this problem and resolved it? If not, I will use the warranty."

Do We Even Need Five-Minute EV Charging?
When is fast charging fast enough?  BYD has promoted 5 minute charging to 250 miles of range, but I'd argue that EV charging is different than gasoline fill-ups.  With gas you always have to visit a station, and every minute you stand by the pump is a wasted minute.

With EV charging, you (assuming you normally charge at home) are probably on a trip and will be spending 10-15 minutes hitting the potty and maybe buying snacks and drinks...even just stretching and taking the dog out for a break.  Once EVs can charge 10-80% in that timeframe I think the problems to solve relate to ubiquitous availability and reliability, not speed."

BOB Fastag not working
I own a Nexon EV and it came with the BOB fastag. It was working absolutely fine till September - October’24 as I did a road trip from Mumbai to Jaisalmer and back to mumbai. As my commute is local I only recharge my fastag when required. Lately all the malls have started accepting parking charges through fastag and I also wanted to see the new coastal road in mumbai so I had done a recharge of 500 a week ago.
Now two three days after the recharge I went to oberoi mall and the scanner wasn’t able to scan my fastag, while it was easily scanning all the cars passing by(which also led to slight embarrassment) next day I went to the sea link and the scanner wasn’t able to scan my fastag, the toll collector guy also tried to scan with the rfid gun but it didn’t scan i ended up paying with cash (this is where I started noticing their might be a problem with my fastag). Out of curiosity, today I visited all the malls nearby(Oberoi, inorbit, infinity) just to check if there’s any problem, and guess what none of the malls scanners were able to scan my fastag and I ended up paying cash, so definitely there’s some problem. 
Please let me know what shall I do to rectify this as I’ll be traveling to banglore next week and obviously fastag must not have any problem then.

(As I mentioned earlier that I only recharge the fastag when necessary, so while I came back to mumbai from my jaisalmer trip, the balance after reaching home was -20, as some or the other toll must’ve increased. But I don’t think negative balance must be an issue as in the past my fastag has always been in negative until I recharge the exact required amount which then worked flawlessly)

Any help would be highly appreciated.

My AION Y Plus, very spacious, quite weird-looking
**I was torn between:**

* GAC AION Y Plus
* Geely EX5
* GAC AION V
* Wuling Cloud EV

I finally went with the AION Y Plus because they had a promo for the 2024 old stock (there are impacts from the old stock, discussed in the cons section) which made the price very competitive with the Wuling Cloud EV. Now, the AION Y Plus has become my go-to for every day stuff, and it's also great for shopping because of the self-opening trunk. Anyway, here are the good, the bad, and... its unique quirks.  
  
[This post in video, with English subtitle available](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D8r1jC3p0PI). Some things like the rust and car scale/size are better seen in the video than photo.



**The Wow Factors**

* **Insanely Spacious:** Seriously, this car is super duper spacious. I'm 178cm tall and still have plenty of room in both the front and back. I even find the back more comfortable. My pregnant wife is also comfortable in the back with the ample legroom, and it's easy to bring stuff and put it between the front/back seats.
* **Hills? No Problem!:** No drama with gear changes or anything. Electric cars are just like that, the acceleration is very smooth and responsive. But I didn't expect with the spec and price to be so much lower than the Ioniq 5, yet the ease of climbing hills is similar. I thought it would be sluggish, considering the AION Y Plus motor is lower speccd. Or are all electric cars just that zippy on hills?
* **Comfortable Minimalist Interior:** The trims are soft, the steering wheel is comfortable to grip, the the AC blower is still manual. The design is minimalist but functional.
* **ADAS Features:** The driver assistance features are quite helpful, especially for long trips. But yeah, it tends to stick to the left, which is nice for relaxing in the left lane (im in RHD region). Oh, another good thing is that the ADAS can automatically resume after I temporarily take over, like after moving to the right lane to overtake and then back to the left lane, it automatically resumes.
* **Smooth Ride:** For me, for some reason, it feels more comfortable than the Ioniq 5 at low speeds. It feels smoother. Maybe it's just different tuning? The Ioniq 5's suspension specs are better.



**The Uh-Ohs**

* **Car Shakes Above 80km/h:** Seriously, it's very uncomfortable and a bit scary. True that most highways don't have a max speed of 100km/h... Luckily, after complaining to the service center, they did something, and this problem disappeared, and the steering also became heavier and more stable. The rust spots were also cleaned by the service center.
* **Piano Black Everywhere!:** There's piano black plastic on touch areas in the interior, like the door armrests. Piano black plastic gets dirty and scratched easily. But they don't allow protective plastic to be applied, saying it voids the warranty.

* **Only One USB!:** This is a real pain. In this day and age, how can there only be one USB-A? Luckily, I bought an extra adapter so we can charge our phones together. Okay, okay, it's not strictly just one. There's another one in the back, and one more behind the rearview mirror, which they say is for a dashcam since you're not allowed to take power from other sources.
* **Wireless Charger Too Powerful?:** After charging my Google Pixel there for a few hours, the screen seemed to be burnt. [Here's a video explanation from AION](https://youtu.be/D8r1jC3p0PI?t=938) (15:40), judge for yourself. English subtitle is available.
* **Limited Steering Wheel Adjustment:** The steering wheel only goes up and down, not forward and backward. So for me, at 178cm tall, it's a bit hard to find the perfect driving position.

  
**The Hmm... Unique Things**

https://preview.redd.it/i78cg8y6gire1.png?width=1920&format=png&auto=webp&s=ae41176bb1a871d1fcc02bbd4eb989c3f24f6608

* My wife says the front looks like a cat's whiskers. Anyway, it's quite eye-catching on the road. I don't know if it's in a good way or what... Anyway, not suitable for those who prefer a low profile or a ""saner"" design.
* I really like the hazard button's position, it's easy to reach. Right in the middle, easy to press with my left hand.
* There's **a spare tire** in the trunk! This is very rare in electric cars these days.
* The ambient light is adjustable, and my favorite setting is OFF (so it doesn't reflect on the windshield at night).
* There's a small hook next to the front passenger glove box. Handy for hanging a bag of fried snacks.
* FREE WIFI HOTSPOT (2 yrs) From what I've checked, it seems to use 4G Telkomsel. But the signal is often worse than my phone's. I suspect the modem still uses the standard LTE bands in China. So there are bands in Indonesia that it's not compatible with, hence the worse signal. 



**Additional notes**

https://preview.redd.it/9pm1d533iire1.png?width=1868&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8bf1d8e9747995963f8175d76573f3be838e719

* Indomobil, the AION's local partner, seems half-hearted about selling. This car seems to have just been left in the yard and exposed to rain, etc. Resulting in rust in various places. Also, the shaking above 80km/h was fixed after I took it to the service center, they cleaned the rusts too. The AC was incredibly noisy, fixed after I asked for an AC firmware update. These things should have been resolved before it reached the buyer. Oh, and (tiny) paint chip.... risk of rust? a non-issue?

https://preview.redd.it/q4b09uugkire1.png?width=1886&format=png&auto=webp&s=2273fb4d4cef13cf61c844d92d92e709a783da07

* OTA functionality exists but isn't full OTA. Infotainment updates, etc., are still manual at the dealer. Module updates (in my case, the aircon FW) are also done via OBD2.
* Android Auto works well. Though unfortunately, it has no integration with the car itself, so it doesn't know the battery SoC, etc. And there's a bug that makes the map guidance and Google Assistant sounds way too loud.
* The AION Wall Charger cannot get the night charging cashback promo. Don't believe what various AION parties and Wall charger partners say about being able to get the night charging cashback promo. Or ask for a written agreement on stamped paper that you can indeed get the night charging cashback promo. After the charger is installed, the AION partner just says it's not possible because the AION wall charger doesn't support the OCPP standard.
* Public EV charging stations are still not 100% problem-free. I even got [stranded](https://youtube.com/shorts/PIaSUARwiL4) once, and for some reason, the mobile app is very complicated AND slow AND buggy. I haven't used privately-owned charging stations because there aren't any in my city.

Anyway, overall, I'm quite satisfied with the AION Y Plus itself. This car is perfect for families who need a spacious, comfortable car. There are some shortcomings, but for me, the advantages far outweigh them, and the shortcomings are more related to Indomobil itself."

Thoughts from 6.5k mile road trip from Houston to Banff through Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma
As summer approaches, I'm sure some of us will be embarking on a long road trips. I'm writing this post to help those people on the fence about taking their EV or not.

I have a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E GT PE (official range only 260 miles) and took it on a looong road trip last summer from Houston up to Banff, through charging deserts (and literal deserts! lol) in Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and of course Texas - which imo is basically a worst case scenario for charging deserts (super rural, super um...Republican) - so if I can do it on that route, you can do it on your route!

Here was my route, planned out on ABRP: https://imgur.com/a/M4HSfQp

https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=8faa54d7-2b08-4c93-8617-2f3367c075c7

The route itself was 6.5k miles, but since I was gone all summer exploring these areas, I actually put about 12.5k miles on my car.

Tips for anyone looking to do the same thing:

(1) Buy the Electrify America and/or Tesla membership - you break even in reduced charging costs in like 2 chargers. You can even sign up, then immediately un-sign up so that way you don't forget to cancel your membership before the next month starts (membership stays active for the rest of the month).

(2) For anyone planning on using Tesla supercharging - NOT ALL TESLA SUPERCHARGERS WORK WITH CCS CARS. The best way to find which ones DO is to download and use the Tesla app. You have to tell it what car you are driving, and it will then filter to only show you Tesla superchargers that will work with your car.

(3) For anyone anxious about how to find chargers en route, I found the absolute best way was to use ABRP, and then just verify that the next stop you're hitting up is working via plugshare. If you have a copilot, bonus points if you have them verify the wait time at the next electrify america or tesla station too. It was great!

~~~

Takeaways:

(1) Electrify America stations, for all the shit they get, had pretty great uptime. I only ran into a couple chargers along the way that didn't work, and when that happened, I just moved one stall over. There was only *one* time when I had to wait because all stalls were taken and even then my total wait time was 7 minutes before the first stall opened up and the Rivian waved me in.

(2) Tesla superchargers ... were actually pretty reliable and useful. However, they are annoying to use as a non-Tesla because you do have to be a dick and tie up *at least* 2 spaces. There were some that I had to pull in horizontally for and take up THREE spaces because not only was the cord short, but the curb was so high that if I pulled in, I would have hit it. This was never so big of a problem that I blocked another Tesla from charging (there were always other stalls available when I blocked 2 or 3 chargers), but I still felt a little weird about it.

(3) Unsurprisingly, charging in Colorado and in British Columbia was WAAAAY EASIER to find and use than in say ... South Dakota or Wyoming. In B.C. I was shocked at how cheap the electricity was in comparison to the elevated gas prices people were paying. It makes enormous financial sense to have EVs in B.C. and in Alberta. Kind of jealous tbh lol. And in Colorado, chargers are EVERYWHERE, even in tiny towns in the mountains like Alma, CO.

(4) If you can't find airbnbs with L2 charging (and you should try!), L1 charging off of a spare outdoor outlet actually is pretty decent. I was working remotely from lots of these places and could charge about 30% of my 90kwH battery in a 24 hour period, which was big enough to notice. There were times when I had to drive just to get my car off of 100% battery because whoops, I had charged to full without thinking about it.

(5) Taking a break every 2-3 hours made me noticeably less tired when reaching destinations. For me, I had my dog with me, so I took him on walks during this time (which is something I'd have to make time to do anyway if I had a gas car) or got snacks/fast food nearby.

(6) At campsites if you're camping with your car, you can let the car run all night with AC if it's too hot - and you'll barely make a dent in your battery. I think it cost me like 5-10% of my battery to run the AC ALLLLL night.

~~~

Noticeable cons:

(a) I won't only paint a rosy picture. There were *some* remote mountain trailheads or campsites that I could NOT access because it was more than 100 miles from the nearest charger, so that was disappointing. This was especially true in Montana and Wyoming and Idaho. If you're visiting civilization, this won't bother you - but I do like to camp and hike...

(b) My 260 mile range was really only like 160-190 miles effectively - why? Well you're usually not starting at 100% and not ending at 0% between chargers, plus that 260 mile estimated range isn't at highway speeds (where you are less efficient). This wasn't really that big of a deal, but is important to know when you are planning your road trip.

(c) There were two times when I had to backtrack and hit up a charging station because I found something cool along the way I wanted to detour to. Not gonna lie, that was a little annoying - but only twice in a 12,500 mile journey isn't that bad imo.

Once in Wyoming because I wanted to visit Fossil Butte National Monument (which was cool!); and once in South Dakota because the ABRP charger that I was linked to looked like it was offline and I didn't check until I was already en route via Plugshare. The second time around, I honestly probably could have just slowed my speed to 70mph instead of 85 and made it to the next station on my way, but I was too freaked out at the prospect of having no charge in the middle of South Dakota without reception, so I turned around 30 minutes the wrong way to hit up the closest EA station

(d) All charging stops aren't made equal. Some of them are amazing, with restaurants / shopping / a small park or walking trail nearby (BUCEEs were AWESOME for this). But others are just a gas station and concrete nearby. Also, since you're now snacking at the restaurants nearby the charger, you won't be able to do so at mom and pop shops along the way unless you explicitly stop at them now and ""waste"" time by doing so (that you could have otherwise spent charging).

~~~

Hopefully this helps make people less anxious on any road trips that they're considering this summer. I won't lie -  if you have access to an ICE vehicle *for free*, you should probably do that instead. You get places noticeably slower with an EV, both because of the charging stops and because you are more likely to drive at a more reasonable speed because you'll notice how much your efficiency drops off at 95mph vs 70mph. And you'll never have to backtrack to the nearest charger because you found a cool detour on the way.

That being said, I probably would NOT go out and rent an ICE vehicle specifically for this purpose. The road trip in the EV was really nice and really smooth and bluecruise was cool. In B.C. and Alberta specifically, I paid SO MUCH LESS in electricity (even with DCFC) than I would have in fuel. That was amazing.

Happy to answer any questions from anyone looking to do road trips in the same areas or road trips in general!"

14 miles of battery warranty left!
Just wanted to give people a data point.   My 2020 Tesla Model 3 LR purchased new just over five years ago has 119,986 miles as of today.

Analysis from Recurrent indicates 89% of battery capacity left, which is more than I expected. The Tesla service menu battery health check says 87% capacity left.

I just completed a \~1900 mile road trip.  The car charged at 250kW (initially) at each of the highest capacity superchargers along the route.

Many Tesla owners will extol the virtues of their car, but I'd like to tell you my experience with Tesla service.  I know people love to diss on Tesla service, It has been great for the times I've been into a service center.  Once for an odd problem the first week where the car was not marked as sold and delivered in Tesla's system, and then for an once air conditioner compressor replacement.  Two service center visits in five years/120,000miles?  I'll take that.    The times that I've had Tesla mobile service come to where I have the car for a couple of recalls and a regular brake inspection were easy.   A shout out to the employees at Tesla.   Well, except that one.   

Edit: got an automod message that says 'check out my EV' flair requires a minimum number of characters so I updated the post with the service center experience.   "

Retractable Charging Cord at public chargers: Would this solve the copper theft problem?
Two ways to solve the EV charging cord cutting theft for copper.

1) All public charging have no cord so you need to bring your own cord.  This is not convenient and would be added cost to all EV owners.

2) Make the charging cord at public charger retractable.

Imagine something like this.

Scan / use app / credit card etc...to purchase

The locker opens.

Pull out the charging cord.

Charge.

When done charging.  Press the ""retract"" button inside the locker. The cord will retract.  Close the locker.  


-------------

If a copper thief used a prepaid phone and credit card to open the locker, that thief can gain access to open the locker to steal the copper.  But the EV charging company can charge $50 to that thief.

If the copper is sold for $50 but you got charge $50 for that, it would be unprofitable it to steal.

Say hello to Herbie!
I picked up this beauty ten days ago and I am very much in love. It's even prettier then I thought it would be, there's lots of room for activities and driving this thing just feels amazing.

I noticed that there are plenty of both positive and negative thoughts about this car, people tend to have an opinion about it either way. The good ones mostly seem to be about the spaciousness and the general look and design, which I can certainly understand. There's some kind of positive quirkiness about it.

An added bonus on a personal note is the seating position. I am 1m98 (or 6'6"") and have several herniated discs in my back. I had to get rid of my old car because it was way too low, causing my back to act up on longer drives. With this it's much better, I am able to drive a lot further without complaints. Also, no problems anymore if someone has to sit behind me!

Amongst the negative opinions is mileage, which I personally think is not that bad? I get around 240-245 (real) miles for a full charge, with a 79 kWh battery.

What do you think? Happy to answer any questions! Besides maybe US specific questions regarding markups or charging or something, I live in Europe so for those my answer to everything is 42."

Sold my Tesla for a Kia EV6 GT!
[Kia Ev6 GT](https://preview.redd.it/hi4m1cpb6cpe1.jpg?width=2048&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=877743bdfed79455ef649cc19de6f516c826fc91)

Couldn’t drive around in a car tainted by the president of the USA, Elon Musk.

Love my new ride, but miss the better software, app and charging infrastructure.

My first road trip between Toronto and Montreal was not fun. It was full of chargers not working on arrival and slow charging speeds. The Kia Ev6 could charge to 238kwh but only did it once on the whole trip. Tried Shell chargers rated for 350kwh and it failed to connect. Tried Petro Canada chargers rated for 350kwh and failed to charge. Only the Electrify Canada chargers worked (mostly). The first Electrify Canada 350kwh rated charger failed to connect (tried on my trip to Montreal and again on the way back to Toronto). Not sure if it was a compatibility issue (with my car specifically), or if it was just a problem with the chargers. I tried calling Electrify Canada while at one of the 350kwh chargers and the person on the phone said from his end the charger was reporting as functional. He was arguing with me. Told me to unplug from the 150kwh charger I was using to try the 350kwh again, but at that point I was so frustrated and annoyed I just wanted to finish up and leave.

In comparison to my 2021 Tesla Model 3 SR+, I like the extra HP of my Kia (300hp vs 567hp). I like the HUD, the extra display in front of the steering wheel, the bucket seats, the extra leg room in the back, the sunroof that opens.

What I preferred in my Tesla: software, charging network, felt smaller and easier to park, larger windows. I've driven the Tesla for 4 years and most likely would have gotten another one if it wasn't for the nonsense of management."

Traded in my Tesla MY For an Equinox EV RS AWD
Traded in my 2023 Model Y LR for this new 2025 Chevy Equinox EV RS AWD with Supercruise. I had some positive equity in my MY, which made this a no brainer since the payments are less. 

I'm paying 366.69 for a 36 Month lease. The dealership told me that ""leases can not claim the federal EV tax credit"" so I'll be getting that during my tax return in 2026 I guess. But besides that, it's been a pretty smooth transition! 

The road noise on the Equinox is much less, the wind noise is less, and the steering and acceleration feel similar to my MY (in chill mode). 

No creaks, no groans, no fit and finish issues. The one thing that I'm going to miss is automatic profile adjustments based on who sat in the driver's seat, but that's a first world problem. 

OnStar didn't nag me about getting a safety plan or ask for my credit card info; they just let me know that I had a free hotspot with unlimited data for 8 years because of Supercruise, which is awesome. 

Apparently the equinox supports plug and charge for EVGo and EVConnect, as well as Flo in Canada, which is really cool. I also picked up my Lectron NACS->CCS adapter for superchargers, which I'm already set up for from my Tesla. 

All in all I'm ready to tackle the road!"

Electric VW Transporter
Hi all.

Any help appreciated. I bought an electric VW Transporter last week and have noticed several issues. One being on a full charge it only reads a range of 66 miles, whereas the seller advised it can do 80 miles. Might be true, but not this particular van with the current battery

Second, if I leave the van turned off for even half an hour, it loses 2-3 miles on the range. Is this normal or indicative of a problem with the battery? Seems mental you would reasonably expect a 10 mile loss of range for turning the engine off a few times a day to pop to the shops etc

It is supposed to be capable of charging at 50kWh. It’s only a 37kWh battery so should be achieving a near full charge in 45 minutes, as the seller described on his listing. However, what should have been a 3 hour drive including charge time yesterday took me 6 & a half hours. I took a screenshot (as I have with all of my charges at public charge points), clearly showing the significant time it is taken to not even achieve a half full charge. Would this also indicate an issue with the battery / something with the van? My latest charge last night took 36 minutes to achieve a 45% charge?

Many thanks"

Bidirectional charging
I have a question about V2H charging.

I'm about to receive VW ID.7 87 kWh and need to decide on a loading station (Belgium). There's a company that offers a bidirectional charging station however it has no integrated inverter. The companies that provide a bidirectional charging station with inverter are hella expensive. This cheaper option without inverter requires the car to be able to convert battery dc back to ac. I can never find anywhere if this car is capable to do this. I know it's not supported right now, but is this a software or rather a hardware problem? Is it worth buying the charging station and wait for software updates?"

Anyone else experiencing constant charging issues?
Edit, sorry for the title, its about a Renault Zoe 

Example video; another car (TOGG T10X) successfully charging while Zoe refuses to charge. https://youtube.com/shorts/ezS3MsZdBmk

I have a ze50 r110 since around 3 years and its on  130.000kms now. 
Around 40.000 kms i have started experiencing various issues. Such as; multimedia brain replaced 2-3 times, handbrake brain replaced 1-2 times, reverse camera replaced 3-4 times, battery replacement 1 time, etc...
They all covered by warranty but as its out of warranty now, Every day this car runs is a chance.

Most frustrating problem is, which the official service point can't fix is the charging issue. 
This car most likely won't allow itself to be charged. Most of the time it says ""insufficient earthing"" , sometimes "" ac charging not possible "" sometimes it just waits and then sleeps, never attend to charge. Of course while other cars, or even other zoe cars are able to successfully charge on very same chargers, public or private. Both AC and DC. 

Went to the service numerous times, they mostly claim its the ""very good protection"" of the car and chargers are faulty. Two times they changed BMS (i guess, charging brain they say) and PSI cable or something similar. 

Still no luck.
There are even some charging stations, which car allows one day to charge, and doesn't the next day. 

I'm tired of being stuck on the road. I have to have the car towed every other time.

I am located in Turkey, headquarters here werent able to help, and they are about to refuse anymore help soon. 

How do i contact main headquarters?

Any suggestions?

Have you had any similar problems?

Last note for potential buyers; i definitely suggest buying a Renault EV ""if only"" your life is very monotonous, boring, and you need adrenaline lol. Then it is a good choice for real. :)"

2025 Everything Electric Expo Overview/Photos - Sydney, Australia
Headed to the [Everything Electric Expo](https://au.everythingelectric.show/) - there's a massive influx of new manufacturers and models hitting Australia's market so I figured it'd be worth a look, since the market will probably look *very* different after the next 12 months once many of these models are here.

I didn't really spend too much time on the already released stuff - things like the MG3 and most of the GWM models and others that have been on sale for a while have been covered fairly extensively, but a lot of the newer players to Australia gathered in one place made for a pretty interesting show.

#OMG WALL OF TEXT I'M NOT READING THAT:
- here's all the images (and a few extras) so you can skip the text: [part 1](https://imgur.com/a/WqkVYwo), [part 2](https://imgur.com/a/dhCl0cm)

#Commercial vehicles

Not a huge presence since they tend to have their own commercial channels for new gear, but **Farizon** (Geely subsidiary) brought [their new SV EV van](https://i.imgur.com/lJv7S0M.jpeg) which looked decently competent - a standard Toyota Hi-Ace sized van with a [pillar-less design](https://i.imgur.com/7SmPPJQ.jpeg), integrated cargo barrier, good width between the arches, [decent V2L accomodations](https://i.imgur.com/k2dIIiB.jpeg) in the cargo area and [accessible servicing](https://i.imgur.com/9k2twDZ.jpeg) at the front. Basically what Arrival et al are doing.

I didn't spend too much time here outside the vans, so no word on range but interesting to see these making their way here into a market historically dominated by Japanese and Korean entrants. (Volvo had a presence with their [FH EV truck](https://i.imgur.com/0JgsqjF.jpeg) too).



----

#Overview

[**Skyworth**](https://i.imgur.com/JyLZq56.jpeg) (AKA Skywell) made an appearance with their [EV6](https://i.imgur.com/Ea4OJR0.jpeg) (will possibly be called ET6 to avoid confusion with the KIA of the same name), apparently just launching a couple of days ago - TBH in the sea of new entrants, they feel like a bit of an also-ran. The styling of the vehicle was kind of unremarkable, if inoffensive [inside](https://i.imgur.com/WbtPYOg.jpeg), and unless they price really sharp, I think they'll be lost in the sea of new entrants. Some of their new models look interesting, but they're starting with a medium SUV that looks like an amalgam of other mid-sized SUVs, so we'll see how they go.

[**Xpeng**](https://i.imgur.com/EXahD7t.jpeg) had a big presence, the [centrepiece](https://i.imgur.com/jLBwv8W.jpeg) being their [X2 ""flying car""](https://i.imgur.com/4txTTWr.jpeg) (not actually a flying car) announced late last year. More relevantly, the [Mona M03](https://i.imgur.com/Dbf8wx7.jpeg) [was there](https://i.imgur.com/zAqsYLi.jpeg), and whilst not available here yet, was one of a lot of vehicles clearly present to gauge interest.

As an affordable car, it's impressive. Good materials and interior volume, although the sparse interior definitely gives it the feeling of being built down to a price, it doesn't feel like a cheap place to be (unlike some others, which I'll get to).

**MG** had the [Cyberster](https://i.imgur.com/G13WGgz.jpeg) there, which felt like an outlier compared to the rest of the range, and MG seemed to agree considering it was given [it's own space](https://i.imgur.com/7fU5GOu.jpeg) away from the ""cheapest EV in australia"" MG4 and MG3 PHEV that occupy the rest of the range. 

Definitely looked better in real life compared to images, but still felt like it was trying too hard to impress with the scissor doors and Porsche-esque script for the name - it's a long way from actual sporting ability outside the 0-60 time. Nice [headlight detail](https://i.imgur.com/pZGMjbz.jpeg) though.

**Zeekr** had a lot of new models on display, in fact it felt like a flood - they had one of the largest presences at the show, and probably the most diverse range of vehicles from the [009](https://i.imgur.com/Pr9fSlw.jpeg) luxury people mover to the funky [Mix](https://i.imgur.com/MPr7TJs.jpeg) flexible pillarless party van (not sure what else to call it) and the more conventional [007 and 7X SUV](https://i.imgur.com/tSvMT6K.jpeg), alongside the high performance 001 FR.

[**Polestar**](https://i.imgur.com/CggEVsz.jpeg) had probably the most impressive display simply due to the well lit, modern, simple layout, which suited the vehicles perfectly. It wasn't big, but the Polestar [2](https://i.imgur.com/6JkeDo2.jpeg), [3](https://i.imgur.com/uASHelg.jpeg) and [4](https://i.imgur.com/SIuGaLB.jpeg) were all on display and easily looked like the most elegant, design forward vehicles at the show.

**Deepal** had their [E07](https://i.imgur.com/ictLCku.jpeg) - for such a genre-bending car, it's surprisingly inoffensive. Not sure how much utility the [retracting roof/canopy](https://i.imgur.com/zX6xzSE.jpeg) will be, but it's got a decently large luggage area and [almost art-deco](https://i.imgur.com/E4Jmsfi.jpeg) [interior](https://i.imgur.com/th33j4a.jpeg). Not sure about the bright orange leatherette though.

**BYD** had their range on display, with the [Shark 6](https://i.imgur.com/v1bWbDc.jpeg) probably the main one of interest - which was basically just a ute. If you've been in a dual cab Ranger it probably won't look *that* different apart from a bigger screen, which is probably what makes it so dangerous - there's really nothing to make it feel obnoxiously ""EV"" apart from the mode switch.

#Highlights

Test drives were available, but since I didn't get there at the crack of dawn and didn't plan on staying all day, there was a limit to what I could drive - partly to get into a seat quick, but mostly because I have fucking weird taste in cars I went with the [**Zeekr 009**](https://i.imgur.com/dDUySDE.jpeg) and got a test drive immediately (people movers are still overwhelmingly unfashionable in Australia).

It's not cheap - starting at $135k AUD before on-roads (which are substantial - I estimate it'll be ~$155k OTD) - but it's honestly an extremely nice place to be; [soft touch materials everywhere](https://i.imgur.com/EXJ865u.jpeg), including an interesting moss-like faux suede material up the A pillars, across the roof and weirdly covering the wireless charging divot, along with responsive screens (although options and menu navigation would take time to learn) and a decent HUD (would be impossible to let go of that feature after living with it for a few months I reckon) it was easily the most spacious vehicle there. 2nd row seats were even better, and clearly the priority but the front was nonetheless great as well. It throws aside the discussion of what Chinese cars are like at the bottom of the market and shows what they can do towards the top - and they can do a lot.

It's chonky - a 111kWh battery and big drive units along with a large chassis means it feels substantial, but torque is effortless if still oriented towards ""luxury"" (there's clear limiting applied to the throttle at lower speeds, but power clearly being fed into the traction motors as speed increases as well - kind of hard to describe but it makes for an effortlessly smooth drive, if not as quick on paper as the 450kW would suggest.


**Xpeng Mona** - I mentioned it before, but it's genuinely a great car for where it's supposed to sit. Still compromised in some ways (luggage space is not as great as the exterior dimensions would suggest) but it's decently attractive and looks well above it's price.

**Kia range** - Kia had the EV 7, 5 and 3 on display, and from an exterior perspective, they look fantastic. Big bold styling, and an upright shape that benefits utility. They're potentially going to bring big sales to the brand, but Hyundai are probably one of the bigger targets - where historically Kia were unashamedly the cheaper option, they're now (styling-wise at least) looking just as sharp, if not sharper, than their ""bigger"" brother.

----

#Lowlights

Feels a bit unfair to call them that, but this is all based on extremely brief first impressions, so take it with a grain of salt and feel free to disagree. 


[**Kia EV3**](https://i.imgur.com/pPwfBHH.jpeg)

So... the Kia *range* is fantastic, but the EV3 specifically... I'd say anyone who thinks EVs are at price parity with ICE cars needs to sit in the back of an EV3.

""Plastic"" doesn't seem to do justice to what the experience is like, simply because there is *so much of it*. The door cards are hard, scratchy plastic, but they're hard scratchy plastic pretty much all over, with the barest of textile inserts. There's really just not many touch points, if any, that don't feel like they've been built as cheaply as possible. Hell, the seatbacks are completely plastic, so every time your knees hit them (and they will if there's a tall driver in front of you) you're reminded of how not nice plastic seatbacks are - even the *headrest* backs are hard plastic.  The doorhandles at least have a velvety finish, but it's not much of a nod towards comfort. Maybe I'm unfairly singling it out, maybe all other cheap EVs will be like that too, but it really points to the issue of where EVs are still at today - the only way to make a cheap EV is to make a *really* cheap car and fill it with batteries. It's not a permanent problem, but it feels clear that every corner is cut to offset the drivetrain.


[**Cadillac.**](https://i.imgur.com/ws3uWCM.jpeg) 

They were there with a single vehicle - [the Lyriq](https://i.imgur.com/KqPZAnr.jpeg) - and it really felt like a swing and a miss. I need to preface this by saying Cadillac don't have a presence in Australia, either in terms of vehicles or mind share. The perception is that they're a brash American idea of what luxury is, more accoutrements than actual substance, and the Lyriq unfortunately does everything it can to reinforce this. 

It *looks* fantastic inside - the [perforated, brushed aluminium panels, the woodgrain that covers the interior](https://i.imgur.com/2GZWwsH.jpeg), the detailed, knurled knobs for the air vents - until you touch them and realise it's a facade. From the fake brushed aluminium to the painted-on, texture-less woodgrain, it quickly loses it's appeal, and touching these thin veneers makes them feel brittle and delicate. It feels like an approximation of what european luxury car makers have been striving towards, but in the absence of a convincing attempt, falls short. Even things like the soft-touch, dampened, opening storage cubby in the centre dash has so much play I was worried I'd end up breaking it. 

[This](https://i.imgur.com/I7lr1c6.jpeg) is probably the best approximation of the brand - a small, backlit panel clipped into the sill that should give an air of premium substance, but it's poorly set into a piece of scratchy black plastic that could have been pulled from the Kia EV3. It immediately feels like it's just trying too hard. Calling it a Temu BMW is probably a bit *too* unfair, but some of the interior does actually feel that way.

What's even weirder is that there *are* lovely touchpoints in this car. [this](https://i.imgur.com/i3HgTGo.jpeg) is actual metal (as far as I can tell), and feels substantially more premium than the touchpoints in the doors - but Cadillac decided to hide it away out of arm's reach under the centre console where no-one will actually touch it. Just headscratching.

The car itself is also very large, whilst managing to feel somewhat cramped inside. Overall, this isn't a car that feels like it's worth $117k AUD before onroads (closer to ~$130k AUD OTD) - it might make sense in the US, but once it's here, after being re-engineered for RHD and dealing with the abysmal currency conversion, it's simply too expensive for what it is. Comparing back to the Zeekr 009, it's hard to believe there's only ~20-25k between the two and that the Caddy joins it at >$100k. 

Also, the door handles are on backwards. (I'm sure it's supposed to be a nod to some random thing they did a thousand years ago, but it's just annoying pulling backwards to swing the door forwards.)
 
[**Zeekr Mix**](https://i.imgur.com/yWHYk4M.jpeg)

On paper it feels like it should be a slam-dunk - it's basically a production version of the coolest EV startup prototypes of the last decade, with an ""armchair"" interior - but the packaging feels abysmal, with storage space incredibly limited and a [spartan](https://i.imgur.com/S8CJF0B.jpeg) interior in order to make enough room for the front seats to do their twirling party trick, and said twirling party trick taking so long that it kind of defeats the purpose (at one point there were two Zeekr employees trying to coax the chairs and centre console into the correct position to stop everything colliding with each other and stopping halfway). Luggage space in the back is also [extremely poor](https://i.imgur.com/tMH2um9.jpeg), on par with medium hatchbacks or smaller, and [no luggage space beneath the boot floor either](https://i.imgur.com/iSk03xW.jpeg). [The seats are a lovely place to be](https://i.imgur.com/395qJsB.jpeg), but it sacrifices too much for something that really isn't that useful. Ironically if they made it more low-tech and allowed the seats to just manually swivel around it'd probably be a lot more useful, but then it wouldn't be marketable.

----

#Best in Show

Would have to go to Zeekr IMO. The range, despite my disappointment with the Mix, was probably the most diverse and impressive. The cars looked good (apart from the 001, but that's subjective) and had interesting textural and visual elements that haven't been done in mainstream vehicles previously. Interiors in particular are filled with high touch materials, and whilst they're aimed at higher price points, they really pull off the feeling of belonging there.

The 007 looked gorgeous with its [pressed carbon trim](https://i.imgur.com/hZpsYnO.jpeg), and the trick headlights on the 7X are the sort of gimmick that actually looks fun ([just don't let reps from other car brands get too close](https://i.imgur.com/1bTYxCJ.jpeg)).

Whether that translates to success is another question, but it absolutely feels like they've got the substance to make a dent in the market - if they can actually convince people they exist whilst the market continues to flood with new entrants."

Corsa Electric Intermittent Power Loss
I have a 2021 Corsa electric. Bought second hald last year and worked without any problems for almost a full year. A few weeks ago abs, traction control and all sorts of other faults came up. Went to the garage and turned out to be a faulty abs sensor. Then worked fine for 2 weeks. After driving on the mway for about an hour, I suddenly lose all power and I am just coasting. The car is still on but nothing happens when I try accelerate. No lights came on. Turning it off and on gives me a few mins of drive time but same issue arises. I got it towed to the garage and they tested it for 3 days without ever replicating the fault. I drove it back home and it was fine but feels like a ticking time bomb. Don't know when it's going to suddenly stop and again. After I got it back home I plugged it in to charge and it charges at 300w only now. I haven't tested it with a fast charger yet but will do if I feel lucky enough to drive the car out my driveway. Any thoughts or suggestions on what might be the issue? Losing power without any faults seems very strange. Also if it is charging slowly and the OBC has an issue why would that affect power loss? Any help would be appreciated. "

Charging EV and battery as the same time
My setup is solar panels + battery with a single hybrid inverter. I also have a Zappi charger for my EV car.

A well known problem with this set up is the Zappi drains the solar battery in preference to using grid power. My plan is to charge the EV overnight and also charge the battery from the grid at the same time when electricity from the grid is very cheap. That way by morning I have a fully charged car and a full battery ready to power the home.

My worry is would this mean the grid was continuously filling the battery only to have the power taken out again and moved to the EV charger? That sounds inefficient and possibly bad for the battery. Or am I worrying needlessly?"

Electric transport groups urge EU not to ease CO2 emission rules
From the article:

>The European Union should reject European automakers' push to weaken 2025 CO2 car emission targets and related fines, two European electric transport groups wrote in a letter to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen on Friday.  

>The letter, seen by Reuters, said the EU executive, which will present auto sector plans on March 5, should not accept slower phasing in of emission targets or basing fines on a multi-year average and that any fines should go to subsidise the bloc's transition to electric vehicles (EVs).

>Any flexibility that pushes back the 2025 CO2 limits will only put Europe further behind China in EVs and have a chilling effect on EU investment plans in charging infrastructure, battery development and manufacturing, the letter from E-Mobility Europe and ChargeUp Europe said.  

>E-Mobility Europe represents EV makers, supply chain companies, fleet owners and infrastructure providers, while ChargeUp Europe focuses on the EV charging industry. Tesla is a member of both.  

>EU automakers say the problem they face is a shortage of demand, due in part to consumer concerns about inadequate charging infrastructure.

The full article has some additional comments and details.

Why are most BEV issues related to software and batteries and will next generation battery technologies really be the panacea?
I've been interested in BEVs ever since my friends got their Model S over a decade ago.  I put a security deposit on the Model 3, the day after the unveil but decided to take it back when I learned there was no heat pump or heated steering wheel for the first production year or so.

Then was interested in the Macan 4 (put a deposit) but shocked about the price delta over the ICEV Macan and that at that time, it couldn't be optioned with PTV Plus.  Then came across a few videos on YT where SMEs were interviewed and they proffered that there are at least 3 major and 15 minor degradation pathways, one even mentioned 30.  

In any case, for my use case (work and personal), a HEV (lower total ownership cost) or a BEV (can be had with better driving dynamics and advance differentials) is the way to go.  

Will some solid electrolytes (not without their own problems) really cut down degradation and get batteries to outlive the rest of the vehicle?

Mercedes and BMW just recently announced progressed on the battery front but I think 2030 is when mid-priced BEVs will come with solid electrolyte batteries.  

With lower risks of thermal runaway, software can be simpler, operating band can be wider, charging speed and reliability can be improved in the cold, etc.  Most of us came from ICEVs or HEVs in which software updates were unheard of except to reduce carbon deposit build ups.

Cars with Best 12v Charging Logic?
My 90 year old Dad still drives, but not much. His gas car’s 12v keeps dying because he doesn’t drive enough to keep it charged. 

I told him EVs don’t have this problem. Is this true for all EVs or do some not maintain the 12v as well as others?"

Thoughts on renting a F150 lightning for a week (as a model Y owner)
Background:  
I own a 2023 model Y and a 2015 ICE F150.  In spite of recent events I love my Tesla.  The family went on vacation and we lucked out with the rental company and got a 2024 F150 lightning. 


The good: 
It feels like a truck, with all the benefits of an EV.  It still has some of the acceleration I love about EVs.  I've grown used to not having buttons in the Tesla, but there are a handful that are really useful (volume, temperature, etc).  Although honestly Ford could lose half the buttons and still be ok.  I loved the top down view in reverse, extremely useful with a big truck.  I loved having the stats on the dash (speed, charge level, etc), but not a deal breaker.


The bad:
The infotainment is miles behind Tesla.  I loved being able to use Android Auto, but I honestly don't miss it at all in the Tesla.  I miss the AI detection of speed limit signs as the maps were wrong on a couple occasions.  Although not a Ford issue, having to use third party chargers was a huge turn off.  Since it was a rental I couldn't use an adapter with Tesla's supercharger network.  I had so many problems with chargers in a single week I can see why people get frustrated.   While I've owned a very similar sized F150 for years, it's used as a backup vehicle to the Tesla and for towing.  Using it as a family vehicle was cumbersome, it's just too big.  EDIT:  going with traffic  on the freeway is brutal, I can almost feel the battery drain in real time.


The bottom line: 
Love the lightning, and probably would have gotten one if they were not so expensive and hard to find when we bought the Tesla.  With all of that said, my only real complaint is the infotainment.  Everything else is not really a lightning problem.  It's too large as a family vehicle, but that's an F150 issue not a lightning specific one.  If only someone would make a smaller 4 door EV truck that could handle light towing and the occasional trip to home Depot."

The US needs far more hybrid vehicles than pure BEVs
The US is short 128gw of capacity for the next five years, caused by data centers and manufacturing.

For example, Microsoft bought 100% of power generated by Three Mile Island when it reopens, until 2048.

It's not a given but it's possible that DCFC gets throttled in the next few years, changing the driving equation.  Both from power companies as well as by shared power for more chargers per location.

This did not pass but it shows recognition of a grid problem, that we can't get enough power to where people need it for dcfc.

**DCFC**

The demand for dcfc would be so big that current shortage is only 250kwh 365,714 DC fast chargers at once. With perfect change over (no one uses more than 30 minutes) only about 13.165 million vehicles could charge per day at that rate.

The US has 283.5 million vehicles, so you could charge every 21 days.    17 times per year

The average miles driven per year is about 14,500.   Requiring you to get 850 miles of range in 30 minutes only dc fast charging.

So to support 100% EVs using only dc fast charging the country needs about 500gigawatts of capacity just for EVs.  And the next five years most the demand is, again, for data centers and manufacturing.

So 100% dcfc seems unrealistic to get rid of gas vehicles on a 20 year timeline, if we assume they build that 128gw in the next five years

**L2**

If we switch to only 7.7kwh charging (30 @ 240) and people charge overnight mainly.

283.5 million cars would mostly be charged in two shifts of 8 hours each.  Home overnight and work during business hours. Very roughly this should account for overlap, fewer but longer sessions by some and weird schedules.  That's 141.75 million vehicles at once L2 charging.

For a BEV getting 60 miles each day would need to charge about 230 times per year per vehicle given 8 hours.   We basically need full capacity for 141.7 million vehicles at all times

That's 1091gigawatts of power needed

It's a lot higher due to more concurrent demand for longer in the day.  And the next five years most the demand is, again, for data centers and manufacturing.

**The problem**

The assumption of this is we cannot build that many fast chargers on any given timeframe.  It's easier to install slow chargers.

The average BEV range is about 300 miles.  Need to charge about 50 times a year, so once a week, if we could fast charge every week.

If we had perfect turnover and people that's a need for 15.75 million DC Fast chargers in the US, all  being used perfectly for 18 hours a day.  No idle time, someone is always waiting for you to end at every single one of them.  While that's not reasonable what does that require?

At $50k each that's $787,500,000,000 needed for chargers

NEVI is a $5 billion program for one year.  Even when running it's off by a factor of 150x.  We need to scale up charger funding to be over $35 billion every year for 20-years (to stay in line with potential generation scale up)

L2 chargers are cheaper, at an average of about $3500.  But needing one per every two vehicles it's only $495,950,000,000 in cost.  Still a lot of money.

The issue with going to an electric future isn't demand, it's electrical capacity and charger cost.

**Where Do We Put Them?**

About 2/3 of housing has a driveway.  Including all parking, only 48% have private parking.

Shared parking muddies things.  Imagine an apartment complex with 200 spots for 100 units.

People like to get a spot closest to their unit.  And what about guests?   The complex even adding 20 L2 chargers could cost be $1 million and they aren't going to be in the right places for anyone needing them.  They aren't going to be turned over well when people sit in the spot all night.   So long term will need more and more and more dedicated chargers.

Half the country is in a situation where charging is a pain.

The other half can charge overnight if they spend the money, and many can't.

Having a driveway doesn't mean their landlord will install one.  What if they need to upgrade the panel first?  About 30% of all homes have a 100 amp panel.

So even those who charge at home have problems to solve

So we need lots of public slow chargers and people today who don't want to pay the dcfc premium to be using them for many hours every day.

That 14500 miles is 39 per day.  Most people would be well served with a hybrid that can go 70-80 miles per full charge and charge nightly with grid management software determining when they need to be charged by.  You may be forced start at 1am, 3am or such to spread out demand.

**The answer?**

A slowdown in EV sales is coming as a result.  We aren't scaling up charging fast enough.  We're building out charging an order of magnitude slower than is needed.

The average car lasts 12.6 years.  That means half of all vehicles are over 13 years old.

A very rough estimate has 7% of cars on the road todays as EV in the US.

[https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62924](https://www.eia.gov/todayinenergy/detail.php?id=62924)

The answer is we need far more plug in hybrid models on the market in the next decade.   We need to slow down dcfc electrical demand by shifting sales away from BEVs.

The rest of the world is already heading that way.  1/3 of cars in Europe are hybrids and in China hybrid sales doubled and phevs could have a larger market share in a few years.

The exact numbers vary by country.  It appears to depend on how far people drive.  Norway is small and compact and as a result fewer than 10% of new electric vehicles are hybrids.   The US is large and low density so I would expect hybrids dominate electric vehicle sales long-term.   Cities like NYC will rely on public charging so I expect those with cars choose hybrids to have options.

I don't want EVs to start coming in with NACS port natively. Other networks are getting more reliable, better speeds and even better amenities.
The NACS - mania that started with Ford getting supercharger access and then kept rolling until every brand, except for a few major luxury ones have committed to NACS.

Here's my dislike issues for NACS, specifically for NACS Tesla superchargers.

1. Not enough voltage. For EVs from Hyundai, Kia, GM high end vehicles, Lucid and even a few German luxury brands. High pack voltage EVs have to use a small onboard booster, this makes even the fastest charging EV a charging lemon at a supercharger.

2. Not enough current. EVs with very low pack voltage, similar to equinox, blazer, prologue need higher currents to charge faster at lower voltages. Superchargers suck at it. Ironically, a Chevy Equinox will charge faster at a 350kw station rated for 500 amps, than at a 150kw station, because of higher current ratings.

3. Tesla will solve the problem with V4 advocates. How long before all the superchargers that are either V3/V3.5 and open to non-Tesla EVs actually get upgraded to proper V4 - with the 4th Gen dispenser and 4th Gen cabinets, to support 1000V at 600A, as stated by Tesla Charging? We don't know. I say, not anytime before 2030.

4. Other Networks are slow to install NACS. This means that your EV capable of charging at high speeds can't charge at high speeds with your chargeport and the networks capable of charging at high speeds don't go into your chargeport. Ioniq5 2025 and Lucid gravity owners have to carry around charging adapters so that they can access networks that would otherwise have been capable of charging their cars without one, at the speeds their cars are designed for.

5. CCS is more capable than you know. There has been testing that shows that CCS can support up to 990kw charging speed, essentially megawatt charging. Future 2500s, 3500s and semi trucks can easily charge on an already established supply network for a charging port. NACS doesn't have that capability.

Let's show CCS some love, because it was tarnished by the bad charging networks, despite it being far more superior. "

Don’t Tase me Bro, but EA Stations are…Fine?
I’ve taken 5,000 miles of road trips in the southwestern US since I got my BMW iX last June, and have been mostly been utilizing the free 1K kWh of EA charging that was included.  Going from Arizona to Colorado, and later to Texas, I have not ever had to wait for an open plug, and have not experienced any significant issues that prevented charging.

There have been some annoying problems.  A few times I’ve had to switch between plugs due to slow charging.  I’ve faced a control panel that was dark, even though the plug was functional…but a month later I saw that it had been fixed.  Shoutout to PlugShare, which has helped me know what to watch out for.

I don’t question the experience of others, and certainly some regions of the country have more charger contention than I’ve seen.  I do believe, however, that much of the EA hate is based on their history which I acknowledge had less reliability, or individual frustrating experiences that are not indicative of their current overall quality.

What I’ve seen suggests that EA’s efforts to improve reliability are paying off.  Kudos to them."

Plugshare filter needs improvements
I want to find charging locations where it's possible to charge 4+ cars at 100 kWs or more using CCS2.

Problems:  
\- First of all, Plugshare filters by station count, not by plug count. One station can have 4 or even more plugs. 2 stations can have just 2 plugs. So filtering by station count is irrelevant.  
\- Locations that have one 100kW CCS2 plug and 3 slow Type2 plugs don't get filtered out even if you select only CCS2 as your desired plug type. Example: [https://www.plugshare.com/location/290139](https://www.plugshare.com/location/290139)  
\- Many locations missing the wattage information so they will be filtered out if you set the charging speed above zero. Example: [https://www.plugshare.com/location/716305](https://www.plugshare.com/location/716305) Speed is included in the location's description but not in the plugs' description. That's what the filter takes into account and cannot be edited by regular users and admins don't seem to care."

Rewiring TT-30 circuit for 240V charging
I recently learned that the EVSE that came with my Bolt is capable of charging at 8-12A at 240V instead of just the 120V I thought. This has me thinking about wiring a plug in my garage for 240V in case I do need to charge. Currently I charge at work almost exclusively because there are free L2 chargers. I also am trying to get a TOU EV rate from my electric company for saving on electric. Ideally I would only need to charge at work, but obviously things could come up (e.g. extra travel, charger unavailability at work) that would leave me wanting or needing to charge at home. The use case seems infrequent enough that I don’t want to pay for the install of a fully at home L2 as the L1 that came with the car seems sufficient for a needed weekend trickle charge. After hearing that it can do 240V however, I am intrigued as this would allow me to maximize savings in using the EV electric bill rate and also reduce the overhead that makes 8A-120V L1 sooooo inefficient. I think that this “Level 1.5” as some seem to call it will be more than enough for my use case.

So, in my garage there is a sub-panel that has a 20A circuit going to a regular outlet and a 30A going to a TT-30 plug that previous owners used for an RV. I am hoping I can replace this TT-30 with a 240V outlet option. My questions are:

1. What is the overall process for replacing the breaker to get 240V? Any helpful guides/videos?
2. Is it possible that my garage is not split phase and just has 120V service, making this impossible? How can I check? Do I just open the panel and check for 4 wires?
3. What is the best/most versatile outlet for me to put there? 14-50? 6-50? 10-30? I know I will need an adapter for my EVSE so this is the major consideration for that.
4. Any other problems that are possible with this or things I should consider?

EDIT: since it has been brought up, the wiring is 10 gauge wire, so should support 30A no problem.

EDIT 2: I am not looking to get a hardwired EVSE or an EVSE with a different plug, I just want to be able to use my L1 at 240V for more efficient charging if needed. It will not be my main source of charging.

Update: I opened the panel and have a hot (black) neutral (white), and ground (bare) wire. I’m guessing this means the garage is only wired for 120V so this is a pipe dream anyway without re-wiring the garage. I suppose I could get a Quick220 and a 6-15 adapter"

Recreational tow vehicles will stay ICE or hybrid a long time
I've owned a Chevy Bolt EUV for almost 2 years, and I love it for commuting. The Bolt would be terrible for long road trips (500-700 miles or 800-1150 km per day), but I think that EVs with good efficiency at highway speeds plus good charging curves have solved that. The Hyundai Ioniq 6 and Kia EV6 look promising, and I'd love to hear your experiences on that.

But now imagine the same 500-700 miles a day, while towing a boat or an RV. Your miles per kWh is going to be absolutely terrible, and you are going to spend a ton of time charging. Worse, if you are towing a boat or RV, your final destination probably has low population density and no DC chargers. (NEMA 14-50 hookups at RV camp sites are probably the best option.)

The towing problem is much more easily solved for semi trucks with predictable routes along major interstate highways. Also, EV pickups and commercial vans seem effective for construction work where the miles driven per day is a lot lower.

Recreational towing is a very small percent of driving, so this seems like a rounding error from a climate standpoint. But a lot of people who buy large pickups and full size body-on-frame SUVs do it for the few times a year they will be towing. Then they use them for commuting, rather than owning a third vehicle (assuming two drivers in a family). Rental prices on tow vehicles are just unreasonably high, and I think bringing that down would help more than new towing-capable EVs. But plug-in hybrids seem like the best option, here.

I thought about bringing up tractors and tow vehicles for farming and ranching, but I think that's a topic for a separate post.

Edit:
A few people have asked what is the point of this post. Well, my points are
1. The EV pickups we have will work for many people who tow short distances, just use the cargo box, or people who just want a truck without a clear need for one.
2. Many people tow long distances on occasion, not regularly. The best thing we could do is have cheaper tow vehicle rentals, even if they are ICE. (Maybe also cheaper rentals on what they tow). Maybe rates could be lower if you take a towing safety course and get a certification. Then many of these people might choose to commute with cleaner, more efficient vehicles at other times.
3. We need plug-in hybrid tow vehicles, and we will for I think the next 10-15 years. A BEV with an external diesel or gasoline generator as a range extender is just a PHEV with extra steps. Is the weight savings worth making the generator external and removable?"

After 1 year and 4 months of owning my first EV, an Ioniq 6, I had my first problem. Here’s how it went.
So back in 2023 I bought a brand new Hyundai Ioniq 6 SE, and so far it has been a fantastic car to drive! I’ve kept up with all the recalls and complimentary warranty services, and my dealership has been good about giving me loaners whenever they need to keep the car overnight (or longer). 

So far, no real complaints or problems, until last week when a big below zero cold spell hit. My car was fine for the first two days, but on the third day it hit -8 Fahrenheit and that’s when the problem happened. I turned my car on and was greeted by a diagnostic screen telling me that a “possible condition” had occurred with my onboard charger and that I needed to get it checked out ASAP. The car behaved normally, but I was still spooked so I made an appointment for the next morning. 

My local dealership looked it over and said that the VCMS (Vehicle Charge Management System) had momentarily lost contact with the vehicle, and that’s what caused the error. They couldn’t recreate it, and it seemed like it was fine, but just to be on the safe side they decided to rip the whole thing out and put in a new one since it was covered by the warranty anyway. 

They said it’s a very rare issue, in fact it was the first time they’d seen it. They had to order the part so they gave me a loaner for a few days, and as of today they’ve returned my car to me with the new VCMS! 

So far no problems, will update if I run into anything weird, but Hyundai did a great job, no arguing about the warranty or anything. "

Every EV needs this screen
This screen https://imgur.com/a/S3Xgt2W is on my 2024 ID4

Many EVs have battery preconditioning but few do it this well.

1. Automatic on route battery conditioning when navigating to a charger (can be disabled).  This is useful, but many EVs don't have all chargers on the map, or if you're using CarPlay/android auto to navigate it doesn't work
2. Shows the current charging speed the car is capable of.  If you're navigating to a slower fast charger there's no point in preheating. Also will tell you if the problem is the car or the charger if you aren't getting the speed you expect 
2. Shows the max charging speed you can get at this state of charge.  Also useful to determine if preheating is worth it. 
3. Shows how long it will take to reach optimal temperature.  Useful to know when to hit the button.  
4. Can be started and stopped on demand.  

All those features should be on every EV"

The State of EVs in 2025 - LIVE! | Talking Cars with Consumer Reports
I've long ago given up on CR with it comes to EVs. I honestly don't think they hate EVs, just no one on staff likes or tries to keep up with the industry. You would think they would hire someone that sort of kinda likes EVs. A lot of the issues with [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=657e0sQDDdo) is because of lack of knowledge. Of course, they picked the questions and the questions are where the problem is, and they basically validated the questions by not knowing why they were false questions.

The three participants all reported on what car they would buy:

* Jennifer - Wanted a PHEV Honda Ridgeline but since that does exist ICE.
* Alex - Would buy an ICE car or maybe a Hybrid.
* Jake - Just bought a car and it was a manual ICE car.
* Dave - Wasn't asked as he was running the chat questions live

Timestamps:

* [Opening comments on the State of EVs in 2025](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=47) \- 8.7% market share and not just Tesla now, a lot more hybrids, lots of delayed and canceled EVs and politics is going against them.
* [2012 Tesla Model S had to replace battery for $20k](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=231) \- Implied that all EVs have battery problems, maybe used batteries are the answer?

If there is a shortage of Chargers, why?!
Just an observation, but we often see complaints about the lack of working fast chargers and charging infrastructure for the non Tesla chargers, but why? If they were a valid business venture and generated revenue, why do they need to be subsidized?

When it's cold, where does the energy go?
So my EV has about 30% reduction in range recently. My understanding is that this is typical for most EVs in similar conditions (10-40 F). What I don't quite understand is where did that energy go...?

  
Presumably the battery holds the same number of kWh, even if it takes longer to charge. I see some of it is going to heating the cabin, but my car measures how much is going to climate vs drivetrain and I can tell that explains at most 1/3 of the difference. Googling around suggests that lithium ion batteries ""move more slowly through the liquid electrolyte in the battery, releasing less energy"". But that almost sounds like the energy is harder to remove from the battery, not that the energy is lost. If it's still there, why would that impact range? Wouldn't it just make it harder to go fast (or similar high energy/s activities)? 

  
For an ICE vehicle, I know that a lot of energy is wasted when fuel is combusted in the chamber. Instead of going into driving the car it turns into (mostly) heat and sound. Of course, that's not a problem for EVs. 

I'm clearly missing something in terms of conservation of energy here. 

Thanks"

EV Charging Station Maintenance: A Proposal
I have now owned an EV for almost a year (23 MME). In that time, l've noticed that some EV charging stations have fallen into disrepair and have never been fixed. This seems like a huge problem if it creates uncertainty in the national EV infrastructure. As a political scientist who studies environmental politics, I have a potential solution that involves both a stick and a carrot- any commercial entity that receives Federal assistance (ie IRA) to set up an EV charging station has a legal duty to keep it operable. Therefore, any business found to have let its Federally-funded EV charging station lapse in operability for more than 1 week should be penalized the cost of installation (adjusted for inflation) for each infraction and every business that maintains its charging stations (ie no lapses longer than one week) should be eligible for tax breaks each year. Thoughts?"

Calculating true MPGe of an EV - tailored to the individual owner
I created this formula as it does a better job than the MPGe formula used by fueleconomy.gov.

This formula is based on a person's actual electricity and fuel prices, so it provides the MPG an ICE car would have to achieve to match the energy cost of driving an EV.

Inputs:  
**Pf**: $/gal for fossil fuel  
**Pe**: $/kwh for electricity  
**Ef**: Efficiency of EV (kwh/100 miles) - can be found on [fueleconomy.gov](http://fueleconomy.gov)

Output:  
**Mpg**: mpg equivalent for a gas car spending the same amount on energy

Formula:  
**Mpge = (100 x Pf) / (Ef x Pe)**

Example - 2024 Honda Prologue FWD with USA averages:  
Pf: $3.067/gal 87 octane  (AAA USA average)  
Pe: $0.176/kwh   (USA average at https://www.bls.gov/regions/midwest/data/averageenergyprices\_selectedareas\_table.htm)  
Ef: 34 kwh / 100 miles (fueleconomy.gov)

Mpge = (100 x 3.067) / (34 x 0.176) = **51**

On [fueleconomy.gov](http://fueleconomy.gov), this car is listed with 99 Mpge.  But, in reality, the owner of this vehicle will spend less on energy cost compared to an ICE car that uses 87 octane and gets worse than 51mpg.

If the owner decides to DC fast charge in California at $0.50/kwh (avg 4.357/gal), then the Mpge changes to 26mpg.

Please let me know if you see any problems with my calculation.

Edit: updated the numbers to use USA averages.

Edit 2: I see that [https://chooseev.com/savings-calculator/](https://chooseev.com/savings-calculator/) has the equivalent calculation in a different form."

New year, new life for our Leaf
Happy New Year!   Last night we just picked up our ‘13 Leaf from GreenTec Auto in Bowie, MD where it got an upgrade from the original 24kWh battery with 37% SOH and 36% Hx.

The new battery was remanufactured and is guaranteed to have all cells over 85% SOH and should lose no more than 3 bars over the next 3 years. When we picked it up, LeafSpy showed the SOH as 86.5% but after driving it home it’s now showing 88.34% - I’m hoping (but definitely not expecting) that driving it around a little more will let the BMS continue to figure things out and maybe go up a little more.

Either way, we’ve been looking at double-digits on the GOM for so long now that seeing >160mi on the dash was pretty nice.  The car had 98.5% charge and 164 mi when we picked it up, so I don’t know what the GOM says at 100% yet.

We got the battery on sale for $8k and the install was a flat $1k.   Total with tax was just under $9500.   True to their word, there were no hidden fees or anything with the install.   Yes, I know I could get another Leaf or a Bolt for a similar price but a) I know the history of this car, b) the rest of the car is in great shape, c) I want this to be my kid's first car when he starts driving and d) I REALLY want an EV with Historic tags.

I think we’re pretty happy with the work that was done but unfortunately the overall customer experience was pretty awful so I don’t think I would recommend them to anyone personally.    Here’s the story so you can judge for yourself.     

I put down our deposit on Nov 11 and was told that it would take \~2 weeks for the battery to arrive at the shop and then a few days to do the install.  Great, no problem - we were not in a rush.

This was just before Thanksgiving so 3 weeks later I called the main line to see what was up - they transferred me to the local shop and I left a voicemail.  No call back.   Next day, same thing.  Called back a third time (Dec 3rd) and by random luck was connected to my sales rep so I pointed out that being ghosted isn’t a reassuring experience as a new customer rolling dice on a new company.   

The sales rep called the shop directly and a few minutes later someone from the local shop called me back saying that there were 2 other cars in front of me, it should take them a week or two and I should be able to drop off our Leaf sometime the week before Xmas (Dec 16-20).  Not awesome but not a problem, again we are in no rush.

Dec 16th comes, I haven’t heard anything from anyone so I call the main line again, get transferred to the local shop and leave another unanswered message.   Next morning I called and the guy who answered essentially said “well, you’ll just have to wait longer - I can transfer you to your sales rep but he’ll say the same thing”.   We transferred to the rep and I started asking about getting my deposit back bc this was starting to seem like a scam.

Rep calls the local shop again, then calls me back a little while later and says they have the battery, bring the car in anytime.    This was late in the day Tuesday, Weds was already booked so Thurs the 19th I loaded the Leaf onto a tow dolly and drove it down there.   

Spoke to a guy from the shop in-person, he said (interestingly enough) that they had 2 cars in front of me that they should be able to wrap up in a couple hours and should have the car back to us the day before or the day after Xmas.  Fantastic.  Still no rush.

Friday morning (12/27) I texted the sales rep to see if there was any update, he said they had been working on it the night before and either were already done or would be done that day.   At the end of the day I texted again to see if there was any news, he said he’d call the shop to find out and then I didn’t hear back from him.   

Monday morning (12/30) I texted the rep again and didn’t hear back.   Around noon I called the main line again and the person who answered was the sales rep, he then harassed the local shop into returning my call. They said car was done and charging and that they wanted to let it top off and take it for a test drive before calling it “ready” (which I’m 100% on board with).  I called out the extreme lack of communication and the guy all but promised he would call before end of day.  (He did not)

I asked both the sales rep and the guy from the local shop if they at least had any stats on the battery - “can you tell me the SOH or Hx?”...   Neither person had any info about the battery.  

Yesterday at 10:30 I got a voicemail from their front desk guy saying the car was ready for pickup.  10 min later the guy I had spoken to the day before called me to say the car was ready.   I asked again about SOH/Hx and he didn’t know.  

Loaded up the family and drove out there to pick it up, got there around 3.   While signing the invoice and paying the balance, I asked the front desk guy about SOH and Hx - he said I’d have to talk to the guy who worked on it and he’s not there now.

Fortunately I bought LeafSpy a while ago and had my OBDII dongle with me so I plugged it in and got that data myself.   As mentioned above, I noticed that the SOH went UP after driving it home so I’m guessing that’s maybe why they didn’t have the SOH handy but for fuck’s sake man just SAY SO. 

I completely and absolutely understand that in a business like this, things can happen that majorly impact scheduling.  During the call on the 16th, the rep told me this location is the only one that has a lift, so they’re getting all the Tesla/Leaf/Volt battery swaps from NJ and Philly.   I get being busy and I get that delays happen.  What I don’t get is why it’s OK to not communicate those schedule changes to a customer at all.   It should not be my job to chase them down and harass them until I get info.   Call me, text me, email me - I don’t really care.  Just set my expectations for when I’m gonna need to rent a dolly or bring another driver with me and let me know if that changes.

So in the end, the battery seems solid, the GOM shows more than 5x the range that it used to and we’re falling back in love with our old Leaf.  I think if you use GreenTec you’d probably end up with the same result - the only question is “when”?"

Delayed level 2 charging at Hotels
Hello!

I recently got a new car and went from an LFP battery to a regular lithium ion battery. With LFP you don’t really worry about charging it to 100 or keeping it there for a long period of time. 

However, with the lithium ion, they say don’t charge it high until you are ready to hit the road .

That being said, I do a lot of traveling and use a lot of level two chargers at hotels . 

If they are clipper Creek or Tesla destination units, it’s never a problem as they are always running. However, every now and then a hotel will have a ChargePoint unit, whether it be free or not. 

I was wondering if I activate the ChargePoint unit with my ChargePoint account and plug it in the car. And then set the car to not start charging until later like during the night, will the ChargePoint chargers stay activated and it will just start charging at the time I set during the night?

I just don’t know if the ChargePoint units will disconnect if you don’t start charging immediately 

Thanks for any help"

Audi EV Range Monitor Gauging Problems - can this be fixed?
Greetings, 

My question for you is - do you know of anyone who has had this problem - is it fixable?

I bought a new Audi 2023 Q5 Sportback in January 2023.  I had had a Tesla Model X for 5 years, so am familiar with EVs, charging, range monitor, battery usage, etc.

I started having problems with the range monitor, although at the time, I didn't know that was the problem.  I took the car to the dealer in Jan 2024, after less than a year of ownership, because I couldn't get it to charge to the regular 227 miles when the Audi app was showing 100%.

Just a few facts: I live in the balmy San Francisco Bay Area, and my car is always in my garage, which almost never dips below 50 degrees.  My driving habits haven't changed.  My use of the heater, AC, seat heater haven't changed.  I live at 150 feet elevation and almost all of my driving is on relatively flat land.  

I have brought my car to the dealer three times to fix this problem; they've had it for a total of 14 days.  Their response to me:  no repairs needed 

Here is some of my recent driving data:

I drove 1.5 miles to the store and back.  Here is what the  range monitor showed during the 3-mile roundtrip:

Range shown   Mileage

   204                20,434

   194                 20,434

   165                  20,435

   167                  20,435

   223                 20,437

   202                 20,437

   225                 20,437



Additionally, here are some examples of when I charged it on different days to 100% 

192 miles of range shown on range monitor

211

227

215

162

168

204

215

220

203



This is not affected by the temperature nor my driving.  These are extremes, and I had this car for a year with out these wild vacillations.

Again, my question for you is - do you know of anyone who has had this problem - is it fixable?

Thank you so much for reading all of this.

Policy Question: Over-Charge Surcharge 
Hey all. After dealing with a large number of issues around chargers (which I won't get into due to the rules about not discussing the biggest issue for EV owners), I was curious if there was any hint of charger companies starting to impose surcharges for running over an 80% charge.

For those unaware of why this is a problem:

1. Using a Level 3 charger over 80% charge degrades your battery AND reduces the efficiency of the charger putting excess strain on the equipment. This increases charger operating costs and thus the cost of charging for users.

2. Because of the worse efficiency the vehicle usually takes as long to go from 80% to 100% as from about 30% to 80%. This means you're basically doubling your charge time for the sake of 1/5 or less of your maximum range.

It would seem like this would be the easiest and most effective way to fix a lot of our problems with access since:

1. A huge proportion of EV owners don't install home charging and then rely on fast chargers for commuter charging. This isn't an issue by itself but most of them also see not charging twice a week as worth the time-cost of running to 100%.

2. Another big portion of EV users such as Uber drivers, delivery drivers, &c rely on the public infrastructure for their business use. Again, this is fine I'm concept. Unfortunately the incentives once again lean towards using that extra 40 minutes of time on the charger to add 3-4 trips between charging.

3. For those of us on long journeys when we use high power chargers we ALSO have a strong incentive to Over-Charge. Specifically the anxiety of ""will the next charger bank be clogged for an hour or two?"" Mixed with the temptation of ""could I avoid a second charge with that extra 50+70 miles?"" Ultimately leading to a LOT of us deciding the extra time is worth it — even when the chargers are at peak use.

Adding a $5/$10/$20 per kWh surcharge on charging over 80% would act a lot like a congestion charge in this way. It could be reduced or de-activated based on charger bank use. We'd all have a very strong incentive not to Over-Charge during peak times that would help correct the natural tendencies we all have to do it. It would also raise extra revenue when people DO decide it's worth the cost to them, possibly going to making charger businesses actually turn a profit AND therefore better find maintenance.
 
I'd suggest it's the most viable way of getting something improved with charger access and wait times. Businesses aren't making money on chargers (as a per-charger basis) right now, so they aren't gonna install a bunch of new units fast enough to keep up with demand. There are also a limited number of parking spaces venues will ever be willing to allocate to chargers so we will reach saturation pretty soon. Ultimately unless the solution makes a LOT of money for the venues AND the charger companies I just don't see any meaningful change on the horizon.

I'm curious what others think of the idea?"

Am I over worried by range anxiety?
I just cancelled my deposit on a Volvo xc40(223 mi range). Great price and great car.

I live up in Ohio and had a trip planned the next week to Harpers ferry WV(340 mi) and then Washington DC(60mi)

The trip down is ok. Bunch of 62kw chargers en route by Sheetz. The hotel in WV does have a charger but once I'm in DC  at a friend's apartment with no overnights that's where the problem begin . Plugshare shows that there are has multiple L2s on the area but it's always out of my way and basically requires me to get a ride to go charge my car for a few hours. 

To add to concern some chargers are not always available or inconsistent charging speed.

I take a trip within a couple hours a few times a year. I think the range here is just too short. Am I missing something? Or is this kind of the EV life? 

It seems rough to have a total range equal to 5 gallons of gas that can potentially take hours to recharge 

Edit: I bought the xc40! Thanks everyone for the debate. Road trip upcoming..let's see how it goes"

The rental car charging situation in Sweden for 2024
Hi!

I have to drive Danish low-range electric rental car in Sweden for about 80-90 kilometers. 

If something unexpected happens, I would like a backup plan where I can charge the car if necessary. 

I understand that there have been problems with foreign credit card payments at chargers in Sweden. What is the current situation? I was unable to register to E.ON app. 

The IONITY app seems to work fine and I was able to enter my card details. What about Tesla chargers? Any tips would be appreciated."

Why have the DC fast charge stations in the US not managed by Tesla taken so long to improve?
Industry Discussion:

Hi all,

I realize that the non-Tesla-managed fast charge stations are improving (such as indicated in the study at the link below) but even now they remain (on average) sub-par, overall.

With regard to rule three of this subreddit (no charger drama) I am also not writing with any particular negative personal experiences.  My point here is general industry discussion based on observations over the last few years and decades.  

I personally think it is in the nature of the matter that DC Fast Charge stations, whose reliability is often as critical for uninterrupted travel as that of gas stations (if not more essential given their relative scarcity in some areas) ... I think that they must achieve a very high number of nines of reliability in order to be evaluated as satisfactory.  The achieved reliability of some non-Tesla-managed DCFC over the last 10 years or so seems to be one or two orders of magnitude worse than what is needed.

So, what has been the problem, or multiple problems?  I'm going to put forth a few tentative possible answers, some of which I subscribe to (to one degree or another) and some of which I do not.  Please anyone who wants suggest additional and/or better ideas:

- It seems likely that some of the networks are or have been, to some degree or in some way, incompetently managed.
- the multiplicity of vehicle manufacturers might lead to significant difficulty making the charging experience reliable and fast across all user experiences.  (As opposed to Tesla which, similar to Apple, had only one brand it needed to serve, and it controlled all aspects of that ecosystem including the connection design, the charging, the stations, the vehicles, etc.)
- The difficulty of getting utilities to play ball and fully provide the levels and types of power to the site that are needed.
- The lack of understanding of how many connectors are needed at a site in order to ensure that individual drivers can get a reliable and quick charge, overcoming the occasional individual port outage or surge in number of drivers seeking charge.
- weather issues (eg: too cold in some cases?)
- brain drain on being able to find sufficient service personnel?
- lack of sufficient numbers of EVs, and related cash flow, for many years.  (this is one factor that gets a vote from me).  In turn, this factor interacts with others.  For example, it's hard to justify a site having 10 connectors at 100 kW each when the number of drivers is not yet very high, and when the utility may still be demanding Demand charges.
- Demand Charges by utilities - is that still a strong headwind for installing the stations.
- Lack of appropriate widespread 3 phase power infrastructure?
- slow progress on allowing DCFC operators to bill by kWh?
- some hardware manufacturers better than others.
- I realize this will be dismissed by some as reducing the credibility of my point of view on this, but I think the question needs to be asked as to whether it's possible that anyone might have influenced some charging industry participants to provide worse customer experiences.  (For one example: could an oil industry organization find a way to harm the billing experiences of some EV drivers trying to charge.)  I don't think the answer is that this has happened, but I do think we should keep in mind that it's not outside the realm of possibility.
- slow-to-market CCS arrival (at first it was just CHAdeMO as an alternative to Tesla).

etc.

So, I'll be curious to see what others think as to which factor(s) have been the most important.

[GB] A quick write-up of my recent 660mile / 1062km road trip.
I recently purchased a BYD Seal Excellence (aka Performance, aka 3.8S). The timing couldn’t have been more perfect as last minute plans sprung up to visit friends around the country; one flying in from the United States to meet with mutual friends just outside Birmingham England, and more who live up in Glasgow Scotland. This trip happened at the end of November.

# Day 1: Tyne and Wear to Wellington - 214mi/344km

[Charging at Skelton Lake Services, Leeds](https://preview.redd.it/4s7gz5so6e7e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=1a4d1945f38fbc121afdc0160c8b3feb1014e908)

It’s raining, freezing temperatures, and it’s windy. It’s the worst possible scenario for any car, but especially an EV with an Iron Phosphate battery. I’m a responsible little gremlin and take regular breaks at least every two hours so I planned a stop at the new Skelton Lake services in Leeds as having never done a long journey in this car I was unsure how it would perform in poor weather at motorway speeds, thus I decided to get a top-up.

I connected to an Ionity brand charger and used my “Octopus Electroverse” card to initiate and pay for the charge. For those not in the know, my home energy provider (Octopus Energy) dished out free RFID cards for people on EV tariffs; at a supported charger you simply tap it as you would a debit or credit card and the charge will be billed to your electricity bill. Honestly fantastic and I wish it was universal given my account is constantly in credit. Regardless of what card you use, you simply connect the plug and tap once.

I only added 14.54kWh to the battery as I got a coffee and cinnamon bun in the frankly lovely Skelton Services (North Americans, take note, this is what a motorway stop should be rather than the depressing gas stations with half a Wendys stapled to them I had to endure in Canada and the north eastern US).

Everything simply worked. That makes for a boring post, but it truly did. After my brief layover I drove the remaining 129 miles in a single shot. Other than the dismal weather there was nothing wrong with the entire journey. If I hadn't have topped up, I would've arrived at my destination with, if I recall, between 10 to 12% remaining, putting the motorway range of this car at 240-ish miles / 386-ish km, or an efficiency rating of 2.9mi/kWh (4.6km/kWh). Given it was below freezing, exclusively at motorway speeds and with the heating on at a comfortable level I'm more than satisfied with that number.

# Day 2: England to Scotland - 282mi/453km

[Charging at Telford Services](https://preview.redd.it/3kd0pd7u6e7e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=9d79f3059d0f1ec1bc2fd784b4afa5df03fc8b78)

I left mid-day and the weather was still horrible, sadly (IE bloody freezing). I made my way to the Telford Services to charge my car using the heavily signposted and advertised Applegreen Chargers: up to 400kW delivery and a GIANT bank of them, too!

Surprise, surprise, I get there and there is only a construction site. Remember, these are already signposted and available on many charging maps. The only charging option were two ancient 50kW unit that still had a Chademo connector, as the Tesla chargers there weren’t open to all electrics yet (but I guess the construction was messing with those stations because they weren’t having a good time of it from the looks of things).

Still, despite the slow charge speed, the services were nice and warm and the charger was retrofitted with a debit card reader. I charged to 60% to give me enough to drive the 128mi/205km to another service station in Burton-In-Kendal. I’m glad I charged to 60 because I arrived with a scant 9% remaining! 128-ish miles using 51% of the battery is pretty great, IMO, given the conditions (freezing, windy, eventually rain, lots of hills), exclusively motorway speeds (70mph/112kph). I’m not going to grumble. This was around 3mi/kWh (4.8km/kWh).

[Charging at Burton-in-Kendal](https://preview.redd.it/yv3ghf4z6e7e1.jpg?width=960&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=74cb82020d662ee7d4c3aa5aa0a18e2625fc356a)

[View from inside the Moto services of one of two large Gridserve charging banks.](https://preview.redd.it/314c8uh67e7e1.jpg?width=2000&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a73ead9f9d7d3dfe2b9060019adb5807b796def4)

Cardinal sin, but I charged to 100% in Burton in Kendal as I chomped down on a burger. It was a giant bank of Gridserve units that were truly trivial to use, well sign posted and reasonably fast. I wanted this 150 mile leg of the journey done in one shot with plenty remaining as it was getting dark, it was still raining, windy, and the M74 had construction and later, rush hour traffic. Given a lot of the motorway is unlit as well it made for a truly miserable time on the road, but I kept the podcasts going and the cabin warm and just muscled through. I forget how much charge I had when I finally arrived (I believe it was 30%), but it wasn't great given the traffic, constant up-hill (Scotland and all that) and heavy wind; probably the least efficient portion of the trip, hovering around 2.6mi/kWh (4.19km/kWh).

# Day 4: Scotland to England - 164mi/264km

[Charging and Polmadie Siding Lane](https://preview.redd.it/vp3cuhga7e7e1.png?width=1280&format=png&auto=webp&s=3b3ff7a566ce7065a02c30735d8e178efcc8c069)

Two nights in Glasgow and it was time to leave. I stopped at the Ionity charging station at Siding Lane in Polmadie. This was a much, much smaller services, but the Starbucks was fine and the little ASDA express had some other amenities inside like a Greggs and warm places to sit. There was a little bit of a queue here as people had abandoned their cars to do whatever it was they were doing despite the charge being complete. Mercifully it was only a 15 minutes wait. The only confusion here was the card reader; there was only one and it was located on a post between charger two and three rather than on the dispenser itself. Strange, but fine. It caught a few people off guard for sure.

I also charged to 100% again as there was no queue behind me and I wanted to do the trip in one shot with plenty remaining. Like every other trip, it just worked, with the only negatives being the terrible weather and one quirk of my car: there’s no low washer fluid warning (the manual suggests periodically checking manually) so I had to pull into a layby on the A69. Again, I’m a responsible little gremlin so I had a full bottle of ready-to-use washer fluid in the boot.

Total cost of charging: £145.16 - before tax this is €145.19 / US$152.24 / C$217.42 / AU$240.13

It’s expensive, sure, but cheaper than petrol, especially in a car of similar performance (500hp+ / 390kW). Part of the problem is the tax rate has yet to be adjusted for public charging, so it’s at the full 20% rate instead of 5% for other fuel types.

Of course, I'd much rather take the damn train, and if I wasn't going only to Glasgow I would've done given a ticket was only £15.

To give a comparison with the Tesla Model 3 Dual Motor (that my older Brother owns), you're looking at around a 30mi/48km discrepancy in favour of the Tesla for a similar trip, albeit I have the power on par with the Model 3 Performance, of which ""real world"" figures on the internet suggest I'm within margin of error; Inside EVs did a winter test and had achieved 218mi from their Model 3 performance, for example, Bjørn Nyland achieved 211mi (albeit at a slightly higher speed of 74mph), where my least efficient portion of the trip would've achieved 214mi.

Overall I clearly needn’t worry about range in the future, and to a certain degree pricing. Long trips are more than viable and the amenities at motorway charging points are comfortable and sometimes (like with Skelton) excellent. Unless you live in the middle of a cornfield in nowhere USA, you've really got no excuse to go electric even for long trips."

New Rivian home charging - smart split through exterior wall
Per my electrician, my outdoor panel is on the wrong side of the house, opposite the detached garage and driveway. We could trench all the way around, but it is costly ($5k+).

My laundry room wall backs up to the driveway, and my dryer takes a NEMA 10-30 plug.

I didn't realize a splitter may be necessary, so I'm behind on research and my car is helpless in the driveway until I find a charging solution.

It sounds like the plan must be, (smart) split the dryer connection, install a 14-30 on the other side of the wall for the EV plug but I'm not sure what hardware is required.

What is the simplest way to set this up and/or alternative ways to solve the problem?"

EVs and EV Charging Challenges in India
Hello everyone, 

I have been working in the electric vehicle sector for the past 3 years in India, Bengaluru to be precise. 

While working in this sector, I have realised that the problem everyone in this industry is trying to solve is not based on the ground realities. 

We are talking about the 2030 targets and how much electrification we expect to achieve and as a result how much direct/tailpipe emission will be prevented. While talking all big sounds good or maybe even required to push certain agendas but at the end of the day, we have to understand and solve the problem grounded in reality and provide real value to the consumer. 

Without any real or perceived benefit, why would someone adopt EVs over petrol/diesel vehicles. 

Even though TCO (total cost of ownership) calculation does show that EVs in the long run will benefit the user more financially and will also reduce their carbon footprint but counter balancing the higher upfront cost and embodied emissions require extensive use of EVs and ev charging infrastructure which itself is a big hurdle. 

Utilization is what will lead to a positive outcome.

I would like to know what is preventing Indians if at all from switching to EVs and what are the core problems that all players should actually focus on instead of preaching and green washing the consumers?

Internet Connection and Car Charger
I'm in the UK with a SyncEV charger - two vehicles, both Pugs: e208 and 3008 hybrid. But this is not about the cars: I'm finding that the charger fairly often (every 3- 5 weeks) fails to completely charge during the early morning hours. It's connected via 802.11 to my router, and my theory is that the router (or the charger) renews the IP lease causing the internet to drop momentarily and this stops the charging.   
Does anyone else have this problem, and do you think the IP lease renewal is the issue, or should I be looking for another cause?"

A rough cost breakdown on EV vs ICE
https://preview.redd.it/jl9mhlbsdh6e1.png?width=1199&format=png&auto=webp&s=2763ee90546d3a74221d08dee5507edb5e7a7749

Basically I wanted to break down the cost between a EV and ICE mostly for fun. I used a newer blazer ICE vs EV. I did this because they are pretty similar in body and what not, so I figured it was a good way to compare ICE vs EV.

I maxed out the the features of both as if I was buying but note this only adds a few thousand by the end of the 12 year calculation. But it should be noted there wasn't too many options when it came to the EV. If I just focused on the base price without any add on. It came out to this.

Note the cost above does include the most advance wall charger, but not the cost to install it. The reason why I used $0.4 kwh is the Tesla ones appear to cost that near me and looking around that is pretty close to the average. Note I don't have an EV and way too poor for any of this. I'm doing this for fun, but because my lack of experience with EV cars the numbers might be slightly off or I might of forgot some stuff.

I got a quote from an insurance company. The overall cost I basically broke down the upfront to 12 years since that seems to be the average for people keeping their car. And it appears the average American drives 15k miles a year. 

  
Anyways, as you can see the difference isn't all that much. Because I don't have an EV and honestly I am too poor to mess with new trucks, I'm not sure how much hands on most get with newer stuff and EV. So I couldn't calculate the time difference. And charging is mostly a wash since you can use fast chargers or just trickle charge from home. You likely will be charging or fueling every 100-200 miles anyways. And with t he fast charging you're looking at 10 min which is about the time it takes to fuel a truck. The advantage however comes in when you trickle charge from home over night since it cuts that out all together. 

  
I would highly be interested in knowing if the battery or drive motor on a EV can be worked on from home. And if not, the average cost to do any fixes. Outside of that, it appears everything else is the same when it comes to time other than breaks. Like the breaking is less, but the hands on seems to be pretty close. 

Because of my lack of experience I couldn't factor in long term issues and fixes, where I have a metric ton of experiences with ICE. And honestly I am extremely interested in this for used EV since again being poor I'm not getting anything new. Which is why I'm also interested in the DIY for the battery and drive motor upkeep. 

  
Something I didn't factor in is battery degrade or the fact that heating a EV hits the range where in ICE this isn't a problem. Keep in mind the engine is hot already in a ICE so it uses that. From my understanding cooling or heating a EV does a 10% - 20% hit on the range. AC in a ICE takes about 10% more gas. Plus I think this changes massively based on where you live since in some places you might use it more or less. Also again my experience on this isn't there. And then from my understanding some EV have heat pumps and others don't? IDK how much of a role that plays on the range or how useful that is. 

  
**Anyways, if you see any major problems with this then let me know. This was meant to be fun and it is a rough look at it.** 

P.S. it appears when EV can get ranges like 1k miles and insurance gets better. It becomes more of a no brainer."

What is shaping up to be the easiest vehicle to replace the battery endlessly and cost effectively, and/or retrofit with new battery designs and chemistries?
I'm currently running an old Gen 2 Prius, which has pretty great life long support for brand new nickel batteries with a guarantee from Toyota. I'm much less confident in our ability to ever be able to safely retrofit a lithium chemistry to them, as I hear that the profile the computer uses to charge the original nickel battery is not suitable for lithium. We also have potential problems with thermal management because the battery is only air cooled, and there is no way to easily manage individual voltages across the battery. 

I also have moderate experience with the Chevy Volt, which GM flatly refuses to make replacement packs for, or even refurbish, and the liquid cooling is so heavily integrated into their packs that it's basically impossible to even salvage good cells from old packs to make a full battery. This means the Volt will essentially die out sooner rather than later as we have to cannibalise full packs from one car to another until they're all gone.

As I understand it, Tesla (at least last I checked) also do not sell brand new batteries, and all of them are refurbished or reclaimed from older cars, albeit with a warranty. 

Which electric cars in your opinion are looking to be the best for indefinite battery replacements, aftermarket chemistry upgrades, or DIY cell scavenging rebuilds? Please take into account whether these replacements will be cost effective, and whether they are brand new packs, or refurbished like Tesla does. "

Level 1 charger problem 
I’m hoping for some useful guidance from the community. My daughter has a Mazda CX90 PHEV. She charges at her house with her level 1 charger plugged into a 120v wall outlet in her garage. 

That same charger doesn’t work at her boyfriend’s house. She plugs her car in elsewhere with no problem, including at my level 2 charger. They had the circuit checked. The electrician added additional grounds to this relatively modern circuit, but she still can’t charge. I don’t know if she’s tried her charger elsewhere. 

Any thoughts??"

Charging Cable question 
Hi, so my zoe from 2014 randomly stops charging at an 22kw station and sometimes it can't even be charged as a BCI(Battery charge impossible) shows in the car's screen, though at home it works perfectly.

I have a suspicion that perhaps as the car is from 2014 it may have lost charging capacity. 

So my question is, if i bought an 7.2kw or maybe even 11kw cable could it be possible that the car would not randomly stop charging? Could it be the amount or speed or whatever that's causing the problem?

  
I'll show 3screenshots of the canze app for potential information since i have trouble understanding it.

The Ford Lightning is amazing, and likely underrated.
I wanted to share my experience as an owner, because the vehicle is exceptional and I hope to see this model thrive. First, it performs wonderfully. Such a smooth, fast, fun ride, and its a frickin F150! It's the only ev i've ever driven, I can't imagine how silly an ev car must perform. The roominess is great for a family vehicle, the views are tremendous. The interior look is modest and functional. Imo you have to get the extended range, or flash trim or above. 300+ mile range is where you want to be on a full charge, because the truck will burn through electrons fast at high speeds and/or in cold weather. I charge at home, no garage, and with the preconditioning set for when you're ready to leave, its like getting into a little oven - even at freezing. The 2nd pic is me charging at 0F, no problems. As long as the charging infrastructure is within 100miles of each other on the road system, you're good (again, extended range!). The trucks reputation is very good - go check the lightning forum, we are very happy with the truck (and it does 'truck stuff' just fine). Happy to answer any questions."

My EV was aborting the L2 charge because of dirt in the EVSE connector
My Kia Niro EV 2023 was not charging until the programmed 80% S.o.C. at 9.6kW but was charging well at 7kW. I used my ODB2 dongle and the Car Scanner app on my cellphone to monitor the charging power and the temperature in the charging connector (""VCMS AC Inlet 1"" sensor in the app). The temperature was always increasing up to 100°C/212°F. At this temperature, the car stopped the charge as a protection mechanism. I tested with a friend's EVSE at 9.6kW as well and the temperature was stable around 50°C/122°F. So it was clear that the problem was my EVSE and not the car.

I cleaned my EVSE connector's pins with cotton swabs. The holes are tiny so I had to take some cotton off. It was very dirty inside.

I repeated the tests and the problem disappeared even after hours of charging. The temperature is still high compared to the other EVSE, between 70°C/158°F and 80°C/176°F. I don't know if it's still dirty or if it's normal because of the connector design and materials. But anyway, it's working now.

Thoughts about EV's after 1+ year of ownership
I bought a 2023 VW ID4 Pro S in October 2023, and recently took it on a road trip between the Bay Area and Portland, OR. I was going to write a post about that experience, but thought it would be more helpful to share other thoughts about EV ownership as well. This post is intended to help people who are considering buying (or just got) an EV for the first time.

 

**1. There are 3 types of chargers:**

* Level 1 plugs into a standard home outlet, and adds \~4 miles per hour of charging
* Level 2 is the ‘fast’ home charger – needs to be professionally installed because it uses a high voltage outlet. Costs vary but anticipate $1-2k for the charger + installation
* Level 3 chargers are available at charging stations only. These are much faster, and mostly used for road trips. They can charge most EVs to 80% in <30 minutes. Tesla’s supercharger network is by far the dominant charging network in the US. Other non-telsa networks include Electrify America, EV Go, and Chargepoint.

**2. Most people need to have an option to charge at home, but you don't necessarily need a professionally installed charger.**  A level 1 charger that plugs into a normal home outlet can add \~40-50 miles overnight if you plug it in when you get home and unplug when you leave the next morning. Even if your commute is longer than that, if you can plug in longer on the weekends, you can likely get by without any need for public charging. If you have a commute longer than 40 miles a day, and you can’t charge longer on the weekends, maybe you will have to charge every 2-3 weeks at the public charger. *A level 2 charger is awesome to have if you have the money and ability (i.e. not renting), but not necessary for owning an EV.*

**3. If you cannot charge the car at home in any way**, and you are relying only on public charging stations, you need to figure out how often you will need to charge the car. Anything more than charging every 2 weeks will be a headache in my opinion. The majority of EVs available now have range between 250-300 miles. You will be using 70% of that capacity in most cases because you will charge when you get to \~10%, and generally only charge to 80%. This means your typical range between charges is 175-210 miles. If you commute <20 miles a day, it’s probably fine to have no home-charging option and use the public charger every 2 weeks or so.

4. **Road trips <4 hrs.** This distance is not a problem for EVs. You can charge the car to 100% before departing, and generally make the trip without stopping, or maybe one stop. It doesn’t add that much inconvenience to the trip. Most road trips are going to be in this range, so an EV is again fine for most people.

5. **Road trips >4 hrs.** This is what most people are concerned about when switching from gas to EV. As I said previously, you generally are operating on about 70% of your battery capacity, since you are charging when you get to 10% and stopping charging at 80%. So, on a road trip, you have to stop about every 150-200 miles to charge. My Kia Niro hybrid gets twice this range on a full tank of gas (400 miles), there are many more gas stations to stop at, and it takes 5 minutes to fill up the tank. An EV will typically take 20-30 minutes to charge, and you will be stopping more often due to the lesser range. You also have to plan your route and stops more carefully, since there are less EV charging stations than there are gas stations. You also may have to deal with waiting to charge, which is never really an issue with gas stations. I think it’s a fair estimate to add 30 minutes to every 3 hrs of driving time that the same trip would take in a gas car. So if it’s typically a 10 hr drive in a gas car, it will be 11.5-12 hrs in an EV. This may or may not be an issue for you depending on how often you are driving >4 hrs, and how much it bothers you to take a little longer for the trip.

**6. Which car to get.** The majority of EV’s today have range 250-300 miles, and charge at similar speeds (100-150 kW) on public chargers. In general, the smaller EVs will be a better bang for your buck. This is because they are more efficient (expressed as miles/kwh, equivalent to mpg for gas cars), so they can get similar range with a smaller battery, which is the most expensive part of an EV currently. Examples include Hyundai Ioniq 5/6, Kia EV6, Tesla Model 3. This will likely change some going forward as batteries become cheaper. However, the majority of EV’s available in the US are small SUV/crossover type. These are all pretty similar cars. You can search many reddit threads to find positives and negatives of individual cars. We picked the ID4 because the interior is nice, drives comfortably, looks like a normal car (not spacey/futuristic), and was a good price. The downsides people talk about are software, which hasn’t been an issue for us, and the capacitive buttons, which are annoying. There is a recall out to fix the door handles, but seems like a rare problem, and hasn’t been an issue for us.

**7. Tesla** is the dominant EV in the US primarily due to their head start as a result of all other manufacturers being scared to make EVs until they saw it could work. Currently, the main advantage tesla has in my mind is the supercharger network. That primarily makes a difference for road trips >4 hrs for reasons listed above – more charging stations, more chargers at each station, and generally faster and more reliable chargers. However, many of the other EVs are getting access to the supercharger network, so this will be less of a differentiating factor going forward. If you are interested in an EV, just google that car + tesla supercharger access to check on the current and future availability of this option. Some people will argue that Tesla’s software is superior. Technically this is true, but practically, I don’t see much value in most of the features. If you are into software and controlling every aspect of the car from a large tablet, then this will be a positive for you. The other controversial Tesla feature is “full-self driving”. I personally don’t feel comfortable letting the car drive itself until it’s 100% proven safe, which I don’t feel the Tesla system is currently. So in my hands, I would use it equivalent to other highway driving assist that other EV’s have  - smart cruise control with lane keeping. Again, this is a feature that may or may not matter to you. The downsides of tesla in my mind are the interior (“minimal” is just cheap looking; and I like buttons/stalks rather than everything on a screen), the loud road noise, bumpy ride, and poor quality control for manufacturing. The CEO is another factor for me, but wouldn’t be the deciding one if there weren’t the other issues I listed.

 

Overall, I think an EV will work for most people. It will be more of a headache if you have a daily commute >40 miles and cannot charge at home at all (even with a regular outlet), or take frequent road trips >4 hrs. Tesla is currently the dominant EV due to its head start and supercharger network, but advantage will continue to fade as OEMs offer more competitive options."

Update on Level 2 Charging at hotels in Salt Lake City
Original post here: [https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1h5mxz9/level\_2\_chargers\_at\_hotels/](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1h5mxz9/level_2_chargers_at_hotels/)

I rolled in at 40% and plugged in at 8pm. There was a bit of confusion. Was it free? Was it $0.20? Well the confusion was because the ""parking fee"" was free (all parking at the hotel is free) but the charge fee was $0.20/kWh. Ok.. fair enough.

But then the problem... After plugging in, I received an email and was told the ""parking fee"" would go from free to $5/hour when I stopped charging. By my calculations the overnight EV charger at my hotel (6.8kw) would finish filling my car at 3am. So I could either get up and unplug at 3am or I could pay a $5/hour idle fee.

A lot of people on Reddit suggested I slow my charge rate to finish at 8am but my car doesn't have that fine a setting. So I did get up and unplug in the middle of the night. 

Still... when you park and charge you want a full tank (free is best but $0.20/kWh is fine) and you want a full night's sleep. I was able to contact the manager who agreed.

The manager contacted ""Magnus"" the management company who handle the Choice Hotel brand in the Salt Lake area. I was told that Magnus was trying to fine tune the settings for one property and accidentally made the change on all properties in the area. I was told that they have since reversed the overnight parking charge fee.

Now you can plug in, get a good night sleep and unplug in the morning with a full tank."

Car never fully charges at public station
Hey, so,

Everytime i charge my car in a public place whenever i get back to pick it up it is never  fully charged, as if it randomly stoped somewhere. I rarely charge to 100% for the battery's sake but sometimes it stops at 74% or 92% (always different).

My RFID is chargemap and car is a renault zoe from 2014. When charging at home it always charges til i stop it myself.

Is there something i am missing? or could it be a problem?  
Anyone else with the same situation?"

Could a Tesla Supercharger fry a Fiat 500e's electronics?
Long story short - rented a Fiat 500e a few weeks ago in the UK. Had read that the Fiat was compatible with Superchargers because of the CCS2 on the new Fiats. My first experience with a Supercharger was fine - no problems at all. Later in the day I needed to top up so went to a different Supercharger. After five mins the car stopped charging and I couldn't put the car in drive. ""System error"" on the screen. After about an hour of trying everything I could think of the electronics died and I had to arrange a tow truck.

The rental company claims I damaged the electronics (even though the car hasn't been repaired yet so that's TBD). I'm on the hook for the full excess of almost $2000 even though I don't think this was my fault at all. Had the rental company told me to avoid Superchargers obviously I would have!

  
Update: Insurance claim denied through Chase Sapphire Reserve as apparently I accepted the CDW even though according to the rental company's website """"CDW is NOT included in the rate for bookings made through a US website and must be paid at the desk on collection."" Which I didn't pay. 

What a mess. "

Problems with home charging
Wondering if anyone can help. Just bought a 52kwh 2020 Renault Zoe, which I’m plugging into a 3 pin plug at home, going into a type 2 port in the vehicle.

Generally starts ok, but as soon as I use any other appliance in the house, or even switch a light on/off, it causes the electrics to trip out. I’ve tried plugging into 3 different plugs in the house and same thing happens. If I plug it in last thing at night then it will charge through the night until I switch something on in the morning.

I previously have a Nissan Leaf, which had a slightly different connector to the car, but was still plugging into a 3 pin plug. With this car, the electric would trip out when I initially plugged in it, but once I switched the electric back on I’d have no issue.

Any ideas what I need to do? Would getting a home installer help? Any advice would be gratefully received!!"

In general, the decrease in battery capacity is proportional to the distance traveled, regardless of the initial battery capacity. This poses a challenge for EVs with small battery capacity, especially PHEVs.
Suppose there is a BEV with a 100kwh battery and a BEV with a 50kwh battery when the car is new with the same other conditions. (For simplicity's sake, let's assume that the vehicle weights are the same.)

If the battery capacity of the EV with the 100kwh battery is reduced to 80kwh after 50,000km, how much battery capacity is left in the car with the initial 50kwh battery?

The answer is 30kwh, and since the battery capacity has decreased by 20%, we tend to think it is 40kwh, but that is wrong.

Both are equally likely to decrease by 20kwh.

Let us assume that the capacity decreases by 1% each time the battery is completely used up from a full charge.

If a car with a 50kwh battery runs out of battery power, the capacity will decrease by 0.5kwh at 1% of 50kwh.

What about a car with a 100kwh battery, which runs the same distance with a 100kwh battery, but the battery is only reduced to 50%. Therefore, wear is also reduced by half. In other words, 0.5% of 100kwh is 0.5kwh less.

Thus, if the conditions are the same, the battery capacity will decrease in proportion to the distance traveled, and the decrease in capacity will not depend on the initial capacity.

This is a problem for EVs with low battery capacity, especially PHEVs and REVs.

A BEV with a 60KWH battery is still a BEV even if the battery capacity is reduced to 50KWH.

If a 10KWH PHEV goes down to 1KWH, it is no longer a PHEV.

From the consumer's point of view, when buying a used PHEV, one should pay more attention to the reduction of battery capacity than BEVs. Also, when buying a new car, one should consider the possibility that battery capacity will decrease in the future.

Manufacturers are taking several measures to address this. Some PHEVs do not have fast charging, partly because they do not want to overload the battery.

Another measure is to use the engine for high-speed driving, even if the battery has remaining capacity.

This reduces the use of the battery.

Nevertheless, these measures reduce the advantages of EVs.

Although it may not be a solution, there are cars such as Toyota's that are excellent HVs even if they are no longer PHEVs due to the reduction in battery power.

Of course, the use of relatively large and durable batteries is a fundamental solution.

Interestingly, PHEVs, which at first glance tend to feel that they can be manufactured with relatively poor quality batteries, actually require more durability than BEVs in some respects.

This is one reason why PHEVs are not necessarily an easy extension of HEVs to build."

Is there anything like a surge protector for stove outlets when charging EV?
I live in a townhouse where my garage is close to my kitchen thank GoD. I don't know if the HOA would let me install a level 2 charger so I just unplug my stove and plug a lvl 2 charger cable in to charge my car. Charging hasn't been a problem and its fast but I would like to be able to not have to unplug my stove every time.

How to DIY bi-directional charging
\[The discussion is really: will there be solutions to charge a home battery or do bi-directional charging from an EV that doesn't support bi-directional charging ""out-of-the-box.""?  In a power outage, how do we put these amazing batteries to use.\]  
  
Yes yes yes I know all the reasons not to do this no need to list them out.  
  
I'm looking for how to *safely* use a 2021 Vovlo XC40 Recharge to, in the event of a power outage, to charge our 13kWh 48 V battery house battery.  The house battery charges from PV (solar) and/or the grid but in the winter months solar is not enough to keep the house battery filled in the event of a power outage.  
  
The Volvo has a 78 kWh 396 V battery.  The car does not have software to support bi-directional charging.

This is mostly a theoretical discussion as I would only do it with the blessing and involvement of a competent, licensed electrician which is unlikely.  But let's have some fun and figure out the best way to do it.  And to figure out if this can be a thing in the future.

For example, if you had 54 days by my math, you could use the 12v 120w (10 amp) outlet somehow set up as a DC to DC charger.  Or use both ports in parallel and cut that in half haha.  Several problems with this approach including the Volvo software which turns those ports off after a certain short amount of time with no driver in the car.

That is assuming there is no such thing as a DC to DC charger that supports 396v to 48 V charging.  But maybe there is?!?

Reddit big brain let's go!  Thank you in advance!

PS - bought the car used with low miles, it is fantastic despite some software quirks"

My experience driving a electric heavy truck for 3 months.
Pictures: https://imgur.com/a/1akcd0n

Background: I drive trucks in Norway and 3 months ago we put our first our of 4 Scania 45S electric trucks in to service with me as the first to be assigned one. 

The drivetrain: The scania 45S has a battery pack with 462kwh available after factoring in the SOC limits for max and minimum charge and it is powering a set of 3 motors outputing 450kw/610hp continious power and 511kw/695hp peak. The 3 motors are connected to a 6 speed automatic gearbox based on the design Scania uses in their hybrid trucks. 

The truck: Scania has built the 45S in a way where it shares most of its construction with the normal diesel and LNG trucks. it uses the same frame and cab and everything aside from the 3 motors are powered by two 12v batteries connected in paralel providing 12V and 24V power to the cab and all other components like lights and the air compressor. The end result of this is that it shares a lot of the parts with the other trucks already in our fleet and most of the day to day maintenance can be done by us

Driving it: Since it is in most aspects identical to a diesel truck there are also very few differences when it comes to actually driving it. The dash board and cab is the exact same so you just press the brake pedal and turn the key like any other diesel powered Scania and it uses the same lever on the right side of the steering wheel to control the gear shift and regeneration as a diesel would use for its gear shift and retarder/engine braking. This also includes the option for manually changing gears which makes this one of the very few electric vehicles where you can actually change the gears yourself and this is something i use in my day to day driving. For example locking it in to a gear when going up a icy road to stop it from changing gear in the middle of it, kicking it down a gear or two to get better regeneration braking, and getting it in a lower gear for hills.

Range: Range is a bit hard to define because the terrain and loads change a lot plus we deliver multiple loads in a trip so an hour in to an all day trip i could already have emptied half of the truck. at 50t/110k lbs it does around 200-220km/124-136miles, but when taking in to account that i usually don't drive fully loaded the entire way i can go 300km/186miles or more before i have to charge for the first time. And most of the time when i have to charge it can all be done during my mandated 45 minute break period and a lot of the days i don't use any extra time compared to if i had driven a diesel powered truck. Having tested it in down to -15c/5f i have yet to see any range difference and i am quite often beating the range estimate given in the dash board. This estimate is based on the weight of the truck which it can read and you have a per axle read out in the display. This is thanks to the batteries being heated while you charge so combine that with the Scania app that allows you to set your departure time it will ensure that when you arrive in the morning the batteries and the cab are up to temperature. 

Charging: It can charge of any charging station that has a CCS charger that provides 800v. It can charge at up to 375kwh all the way from empty to 100% but realistically even on 400kwh chargers it usually hovers around 360-370. The charger is located behind the front wheels on the drivers side and after unhooking the trailer i have generally no problem getting in to a normal car charger. I do take up more space than a normal car, but with the amount of chargers available i have never experienced to be at a station where the spot i am blocking is the only unused one and there are now several truck only chargers being built that are designed with the extra space needed in mind

The good things: I love this truck and i don't ever want to go back to diesel. The ride is almost silent compared to a diesel and there are no vibrations at all. It has a lot of power and while on shorter hills a high power diesel can climb it faster on a longer hill the flat power curve combined with the fewer gears (you can do the national speed limit of trucks and then some in 2nd gear) you can qute easy forget that you are pulling up to 60t/132k lbs. 

The not so good things: All in all i have not found anything deal breaking with the truck and most of what i can comment on is the same in the diesel variant, but here are a couple. The size and weight of the batteries makes it some times hard to load right since it very quickly gets front heavy and they leave little room for anything else like hydraulic PTO systems and storage racks. The button for unlocking the charger sits right besides the socket and can be pressed with the truck locked. Pressing it will send a signal to the charger to stop charging and anyone that mislike EVs could go around and press the button while i am waiting on it to charge and i would not know until i came back or checked the app. The Volvo electric truck which i have tested and posted about in this subreddit back in the summer solved this with you needing to use the remote to unlock the vehicle becore the disconnect button becomes active. 

The quirks: Here are some things that did not fit in any of the other categories but i would like to talk about. 

1) Compared to a American truck it is fairly small but it got a lot of features still.

2) Despite being a large truck it is very manouverable thanks to it also having rear steering. A fair bit of my driving is Oslo, the capital of norway, and other old cities and it feels perfectly at home navigating those cities.

Speedy repair on I80
I made a 1200 mile trip to visit relatives in September.  On one of the DCFC stops in Iowa I stopped at a gas station/convenience store in Iowa City.  There were two ChargePoint units. I pulled into the one on the right and discovered the handle / latch was broken.   I moved my car to the left and successfully charged with the other unit.  I reported the damaged unit to ChargePoint on 9/25/2024.  Fast forward to 11/19/2024 I received an email notification that the unit has been repaired and the problem is resolved.  Normal?

Capacity/power loss data?
So we have had an EV that we are happy with for a couple years now. We know that range is a problem in the winter. Not to mention that  the amount of driving we do actually turns mileage into a scarce resource in the colder months. What we are finding is compounding that at the moment is that last year’s fully charged number compared to today represents about a 7% loss of capacity. Is this a known issue that all EV owners have to deal with or might this warrant a trip to the mechanic/dealership? "

Do you need to upgrade your dryer plug circuit to use it for charging?
Hello,

Recently purchased a Mustang Mach E and love it so far. 

I have an unused dryer plug near the spot where I park the car and want to use it for charging. 

That being said, it is a 30 amp circuit and my understanding is the MME charges at higher amperage and would just trip the breaker. 

Posts on here suggest it is as simple as plugging the car in and I assume most 220v circuits are 30amps for dryers. 

So am I missing something? I think I need to replace the breaker and wiring to do this safely. 

Edit: thank you all for replies. From what I can gather this is less of a problem if you have a charger that can limit the charging rate, which I do not, and the MME does not have an option to limit the charge rate. Sounds like I’ll need to upgrade the circuit one way or the other. "

Used Renault Zoe with concerning history

I’m looking at a 2018 “Renault Zoe 41 Intens” registered in August 2019, with 92,000 km on the clock. The car had a couple of major repairs, which make it an interesting but somewhat risky option.

Here’s a summary of what’s been done:

1: New Motor
The seller originally bought the car three months ago at a very low price due to a faulty motor. He had the motor replaced with an motor that only done around 4,000 km and has paperwork for the motor itself but not for installation.

2: Failed inspection in aug 2023
At 69,000 km, car at previous owner, the car failed inspection due to significant axle and suspension issues. It passed a reinspection two weeks later after these problems were fixed. The seller says this repair is noted in the maintenance log,

He is selling the Zoe because his wife finds the charging inconvenient for her long commute. 

Overall, it’s a well-equipped car with new parts that could extend its lifespan, but I’m weighing the potential risks, especially given the new motor and axle issues on a car with relatively low mileage. 
Would you consider buying a car like this? Any advice on what to check or discuss in the negotiation?"

Tips for a weekend trip with a 2023 Polestar 2 rental? (figuring out charging stations)
I decided to visit some friends while visiting family in Texas. Since I flew there, I rented a car, getting an EV (the Polestar), as it was the best deal, thinking I wouldn't be driving more than 150 miles total. My friends decided they want to go camping at the beach this weekend, which would be about a 280 mile roundtrip, meaning I would probably have to charge twice - once on the way down, then again back north. I'm trying to do the necessary logistical research.

It seems like the most reliable charging stations would be Tesla, based on speed and location. I downloaded the Tesla app because I read that you need it to pay for the charging and it can tell you which locations have hookups for non-Teslas (and just letting you know in general where the charging stations are). I have a Samsung Galaxy S9, no problems with the phone, but the app is glitchy on my end. Pressing the find my location button doesn't always work, it won't let me press the button that says to add my vehicle, the list of chargers in a location are not sorted by distance (even though it supposedly says they are), and the list of stations doesn't seem to match up with what Google Maps is telling me. Any suggestions specific to figuring out the Tesla stuff?

And I see a lot of ""Destination Chargers"". What's the protocol/etiquette for using those? Are they open to the public, or merely for the destination customers (like if are a paying guest at the motel)? However, it looks like most/all are slow chargers, but if my need to charge is dire...

A Blink charging station a little north of my friends has two good reviews. One near my destination has one single bad review. Both are supposedly fast chargers (the bad review claimed that his car was being charged slow at 36 kw). Those familiar with Blink - are they pretty reliable or not?

The only other major thing I know about charging stations is watching some CNBC videos about EVs on YouTube. In one, the person went to different charging stations (in California, I think) and documented the ones that were under maintenance, not working, etc. (Spoiler alert: it was bad.) So any advice about successfully doing a beach trip in my rental EV would be appreciated. Worst case scenario, probably decide beforehand to cram into their gas car(s)."

EV/PHEV Repair Experiences
What are actual EV & PHEV experiences, incuding costs and mileage when the problem occured.

 Is there a way to tell if a prior owner abused the batteries - maybe on a fast charger instead of a trickle charge?

It would be good to have some idea of the exposure in the used car market that people like me who want to get the used car tax credit. So where do these EV and PHEV break?"

Tesla US model in Europe - charging problem
Hi Everyone. I’d love for someone to point me in the right direction. 

 I have a US Tesla M3 but I live in Europe. Obviously the Charge port on the car is different to the CCS2 ports here in Europe. 
 I have an adapter that converts the EU CCS2 to my car. It charges fine on the public Greenway charging stations but for some reason doesn’t charge at the Tesla stations. 
 Plus I charge at home using the type 2 adapter. When I use the type 2 adapter at a public type 2 charging station it also doesn’t work. It trips the station. 
 Any ideas what the problem could be? It’s annoying that I can only charge at greenway stations. "

Tesla Model Y vs. Chevy Equinox EV (the family car buyer’s perspective)
After much deliberation about which would be better for my small family I think we have a winner, the Chevy Equinox EV. Let me explain.

So to be exact a 2025 Chevy Equinox EV LT FWD vs a 2020 Tesla Model Y LR. The two cars I was choosing from were on the shortlist because they are the exact same price $31,000. The Chevy is new and the Tesla is used with 38,000 miles on it. 

For reference I have owned EVs for 8 years and my first EV was a 2016 Chevy Bolt. I loved that car. The only real problem was the charge speed was nowhere near where I needed it to be for long distance trips, which my family does often. I have also owned a 2021 Tesla Model 3 LR for 3 years and that car really spoiled me with its handling, acceleration, and the supercharging network is really special but it is to small for our family car. I never thought I’d buy anything other than a Tesla again but opening up the supercharging network up to non-Teslas has really got me thinking.

I test drove both of these cars and it’s pretty night and day as far as performance goes. The Model Y even has the acceleration boost upgrade. Not to say the Equinox EV wasn’t a smooth ride but it feels slow and heavy compared to a Model Y. The Model Y also felt like it had a bit more space in the trunk and more headroom. It’s a bit easier to take a car seat out also. So you’re probably thinking “what gives? Why did you decide on an Equinox EV?” A few big reasons. The first is that the Equinox was more comfortable. The seats felt better, the suspension was softer, and the infotainment was better in my opinion (something I thought I’d never say about a non-tesla) 

All in all we decided on a new car with full warranty and no wear. It was really close though and honestly in the near future I would love a Model Y or 3 as a commuter car. "

Has anyone had problems with incorrect charges from charging stations?
I just came back from a road trip and I had problems with the Shell station and there are three $60 charges pending from that little fiasco. I’m just waiting to see if they remove them cause I didn’t actually get any electricity from that station. Then I look, and I have two from EVgo from the same charging session for different amounts. I’m waiting to see if they drop any before they post but I’m a little frustrated at seeing this mess."

How come we didn't see more vehicles like the Chevy volt before companies tried to go full EV 
I owned a volt and loved it probably the best Ev made in my opinion. Why didn't more companies focus on diesel/gas range extender evs. That fixes almost every single problem that people have with ev adoption. You still have full long range capability along with plug and play charging at home the remaining 90% of the time. 

I feel ev adoption would have been significantly faster if most evs had some form of gas/diesel range extender. 

Then once battery tech and charging speed and stations are at a reasonable capacity then people will begin to adopt full evs naturally over time"

Dual Ev Home Charging
So I just picked up my second EV to replace my partners ICE. I have a Tesla Model 3 Performance and we got her a new Chevy Equinox EV. 

I have 220 ran but my problem is that the Tesla uses NACS and the Chevy uses J1172. I heard it's bad for the 220 outlets to constantly swap plugs. Does anyone have a similar situation and what did you end up doing? 

I know they make adapters for a couple hundred bucks that would allow the CCS to charge on my existing Tesla charger.

Thanks!

**edit**

I would like to keep the Tesla mobile charger i have as the main charger. Also I bought my Tesla used and it did not come with any adapters."

Cross country trip planning
Hey all. I'm currently planning a cross country road trip from Georgia to Washington and need a bit of help. I've tried to use ABRP but it keeps saying no valid plan no matter how I try to segment it, is there a better way to plan? I've also considered just using Google maps and relying on my portable charger anytime I can't get to a charging station, but I don't know how reliable that is. Would it be better to make the trip using highways or avoiding them? Time isn't too big of an issue in my planning. "

Car EV rental experience with Sixt
Hi all, I was looking for some information regarding this very topic a few weeks ago before I embarked upon the rental of an EV with Sixt. Thought I’d share our recent experience.

I rented a Tesla Model Y for 5 days from / to Brisbane airport. I found any rental site out of the airport (in the city area) to have less and more expensive car options. I like how EVs drive, so I picked that; but there were many options to choose from at the airport station.

Some details of my rental:
Travelled as a group of 4 from Brisbane airport to Gold coast and Byron Bay, then back. 

Originally booked a BYD ATTO 3 but changed it to a Tesla Model Y at the last minute as I found it much more spacious. 

Charged at various locations including Chargefox DC chargers, AC chargers and Tesla superchargers. 
I found many posts online and a YouTube video which stated that both Chargefox and Tesla chargers are free. I can confirm that the Chargefox RFID they provided did work with no issues, so Chargefox charging was free, but it certainly was easier to find a Tesla supercharger at various points along our route. 
One of the staff at the rental station mentioned Tesla chargers are free as well, but the other then said it wasn’t. I’ve still yet to find out for myself - will post back at some point about this.

There are Toll motorways in / around the airport area, and we crossed them when exiting the airport and when heading back. They save you about 30 minutes each way, so I’d recommend taking them. The charges are paid for by Sixt first, before they slap on a daily admin fee on top and charge it to your credit card. I was told it comes up to approx 10 AUD each way. Again, yet to find out at this stage but seems reasonable. 

I had an issue with Sixt trying to reverse the charges of the ATTO 3 which I originally booked, as I had upgraded to the Tesla at the time, but they promise it would be a complete refund and that it should all go through soon. Overall, they seemed OK for a rental company. 

There certainly were positives and negatives when renting an EV whilst on holiday, some pretty obvious. One of the main downsides was the stress of ensuring we always have sufficient charge. The main upside was EVs drive great with lots of tech and safety features. Made me feel safe when on the motorways and it was super convenient to have reliable auto steer for the 1-2 hour road trips. 

Would I do it again though? Probably not, especially when travelling as a group which can be a bit tricky to plan around. It’s more convenient to hire a petrol/hybrid, which can also be plenty great on mileage. However, if you are interested to try an EV whilst on a holiday in Brisbane (and maybe even travelling solo or as a couple), it’s possibly slightly inconvenient but certainly doable! Sixt seems to be a good option to do this, compared to some of the other companies. It wasn’t clear if Hertz still provides free EVIE charging for their Polestar fleet but I found an article that stated they don’t do so anymore. We managed to get topped up along the way by planning early using the ABRP and Tesla apps which are awesome and very very accurate. The longest we ever had to wait for a DC charger was 20 minutes and that’s only because the car owner was unapologetically irresponsible and returned late to his vehicle.

Good luck on your rental! Happy to answer any questions if there’s any!

What's everyones take on Batteries being manufactured by Legacy Automotive Companies
This one has been playing on the back of my mind for a while now. 

But I'm interested to hear what everyone thinks of legacy automakers getting into battery manufacturing.

The way I see it, the expertise of legacy auto lies in internal combustion engine manufacturing. All of which would have decades of experience with. 

But now they are moving to battery manufacturing. 

There are very few parallels that can be shared betweeing manfacturing an ICE engine and a battery pack. So to me I have questions around quality, longevity and reliability. Not so much around the assembly of the battery, but moreso of the mass production the anodes, cathodes, electrolyte separators...you know the components that make up the cells themselves. 

I am hearing more and more the the likes of Honda, Toyota and Mercedes are getting into the battery manufacturing game. 

The top battery manufacturers in the world right now are LG, Panasonic, SK-On, CATL and BYD. Would I trust these guys to develop and mass produce a good ICE engine? No! (maybe BYD an exception to that)

So why should I trust an Engine manufacturer to design and mass produce a good battery?"

What is the current state of the charging network in Europe?
In many countries there are issues with charger reliability, broken chargers not being updated in apps and a general mess of different apps and accounts that often don't work properly. This is annoying for everybody and disqualifies many older folks from ever wanting to deal with that. A single bad experience can ruin someone's thoughts on EVs. 

In my view, the whole industry should have followed Tesla and created a standard protocol where all you need to do is plug in, and the car does everything else.

Lucid has the most horrible service!
Are there any other Lucid buyers here? I'm sure I'm not the only one that experienced this.

Wonderful car with the most horrible service. I ordered my car in December and was supposed to receive it February. The delivery got delayed. And then it was delayed again. So, I said I really like the car , let me get the car similar to what ordered from the stock. And they did, they found it. It was a bit more expensive, had a few extra features but I really couldn’t wait anymore so I accepted it. My only concern were the low profile tires with which I had poor experience before. But they assured me that these tires are really great, much more reliable than on any other car I had before. And God forbid something happened, they ll give full service, they ll replace tires, they will give me a loaner, they even mentioned something about one year warranty… Well, I drove under 3,000 miles in four months, two tires blew up. Service non-existent, warranty is a smoking mirror, the response from the dealership is complete ignoring. 

Conclusion: great ride and horrendous service. They care about the customer only till the sale is complete. Don’t buy it because they will spit at you the moment you will need any service from them!"

New vehicle purchase - check my gas/kWh math please
TLDR: upgrading from a 35mpg (city) 2nd gen Prius to PHEV or EV, think either one will save us in the long run as gasoline costs increase here in California, but based on my math it is not looking feasible. I need some input if my math needs to account for other factors. 

For context, my wife has a 2007 Prius that's reliable but showing its age. Haven't done much highway driving lately but have been tracking the last few fuel purchases of mostly city driving and it seems to be getting about 35mpg lately. Regular 87 octane is holding at around $4/gallon. So approx 11.4 cents per mile for fuel only (not including maintenance, etc).
Central Valley CA. We are expected to see gas in the $6-8 range within the next 2 years due to refineries shutting down permanently, unless there is some course correction with the political winds.

Our goal in a new vehicle is to upgrade from what we currently have and have a vehicle that is good for long trips. We think PHEV is the ideal candidate. It would allow efficient daily commute use, but still have the engine and tank to take us anywhere on longer trips like we currently use her car or my truck (400-500 mile range) without having to deal with the range anxiety or charging times of a full EV. 

I'm learning to look past the MPGe number and look more closely at the specs, since MPGe is an average formula based on average driver use case scenario. 
Learning to ask: what is the MPG of the gas powertrain that will take us on longer trips, and what is the kWh/100 mile number.

Example a new Kia Sorento or Sportage PHEV have 31/34 miles of EV range respectively, and approx 34-36mpg gas, but a Mazda CX90 has 26 miles of battery range and only gets 26mpg gas. These are just a few PHEV models we have considered. 
Digging deeper, the kWh/100 mile ratings:
Kia Sportage PHEV 40
Kia Sorento PHEV 45
Mazda CX-90 PHEV 58

We do not currently have solar, it is in the future plans, so for now just paying straight PG&E rates on a tiered rate plan. Obviously since we regularly use the allocation and dip into Tier 2 most months, any home EV charging above our current usage would be billed as Tier 2 rates (currently $0.51/kWh). That means the above vehicles would cost 20, 23, or 30 cents per mile for their EV-only powertrain. Which is way more than we currently pay for gasoline so on paper it doesn't appear to pan out. 

However, it appears to have any benefit, you need to structure your life around a specific time-of-use rate plan, geared for EVs. The simplest one is basically allowing 12am-3pm (overnight and all day) charging at a reduced rate of $0.31/kWh. 3-4pm and 9pm-12 is the same $0.51 as current T2, and 4pm-9pm is $0.62 as a ""penalty"" for using during peak hours. (Yes, for all of you paying $0.10 or less per kWh on average in other states, that is what we have to deal with here)

That brings me to the new math of $0.31/kwh x 40kwh/100 miles = 12.4 cents per mile (for Kia Sportage PHEV), 14 for Sorento, and 18 cents for CX-90.
Until gasoline prices shoot up here, the PHEV doesn't look any better on paper. 

As a side note, even though we don't want to deal with range anxiety, we notice regular EVs tend to have a far better efficiency rating in this sense. A Tesla Y is 27kWh/100 miles, meaning (at this special PG&E rate plan) our total cost for home charging would be 8.4 cents per mile. 

Is there other math I need to consider in this? 
Are different chargers more or less efficient than others?
Would Level 1 or Level 2 charging have a drastically different $/kwh effect on our energy bill?
Do the mpge and kWh/100mi ratings on the vehicles mean little, do they get better or worse field results?
Are you tired of reading yet?"

First-Time EV Buyer's Guide
I often help people on the weekly General Questions and Purchasing Advice thread, and have been thinking about doing something like this to compile my answers to common questions. I'm going to structure it like a guide for each part of the buying process, but it's more like a collection of my thoughts. I'd be happy to add to it if anyone has anything else to contribute! This is also US-centric (sorry). 

#The Starting Line
So you want to buy an EV eh? Awesome! The process is, in general, very similar to buying a standard internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicle, but with a few key additional areas of research. I'm going to assume you generally know the basics of ICE vehicle ownership, and make this guide as specific as possible the electric portion of the vehicle purchasing. 

Let me say this up top though if you are on the fence for an EV. If you can charge at home and have a two-car (or more) household, you 100% should make one of those cars an EV. You'll save money on gas and oil changes, and experience the convenience of leaving home with a full ""tank"" every morning. You can get a used Chevy Bolt or Tesla for less than $10k almost anywhere in the US if you qualify for the $4k tax credit, and they're great vehicles that can completely cover 99% of driving needs (and obviously there's plenty of vehicles at higher prices). If that's all you need to hear, go for it. 

# Assess your situation
As always you should buy a car that suits your needs. Trucks for construction work, vans for families, etc. EVs are no different, but you should ask yourself a few additional questions to determine which, if any, EV is right for you: 

* The first, most important question - do you have a place to charge? The main benefit EV owners cite is that the vehicle can ""refuel"" at home, every night. In contrast, the ""worst"" part of the experience is public charging. Even for Superchargers, which are widely considered the most reliable and easiest to use network, charging takes longer than refueling with gas and almost always eliminates any cost savings from getting rid of gas. It's less common, but you can also 100% get by if you charge at work or a public area like a shopping center you regularly visit. 
* What's your normal daily mileage? How much battery do you need? Almost all full battery-powered EVs (BEVs) have >200 miles of range at this point. You could even look at plug-in hybrid EV (PHEVs) if you fit the specific use-case for it (short daily use, home charging, and regular longer road trips) although having a more complex vehicle that retains all the maintenance of a gas engine is, for many, too much of a drawback when BEVs are becoming so capable. 
* Do you plan to use this vehicle to regularly travel to a certain destination more than 100 miles away? Like a weekend ski trip or family in another state? You can use apps like plugshare or A Better Route Planner (ABRP) to plot out these trips and see what public charging is available. Almost nowhere in the US is completely inaccessible to EVs anymore, but some places are much less convenient. 
* Another way to ask the previous question is: do you have another vehicle in your household? A gas vehicle is, in 99% of cases, indisputably better for long distance travel compared to an EV. If you decide that your vehicle will only ever charge at home (outside of emergencies), you can completely ignore fast charging rates, which are relatively difficult to research and understand. 
* There are [calculators](https://afdc.energy.gov/calc/) online to [determine](https://chooseev.com/savings-calculator/) how much [you'll save](https://chargevc.org/ev-calculator/) on fuel by switching to electric. It obviously depends heavily on your particular situation, but rule of thumb is (assuming you charge at home) you'll spend 1/3 of what you spent on gas ($1500 in a year -> $500 in a year), and you'll have minimal maintenance costs. I will say that if money is very tight, you'll find the best value in optimizing your purchase for your needs. A used Bolt, Leaf, or eGolf from the late 2010s won't have the range or charging speed of a Model 3 or Ioniq, but could save you a bunch of money if you just need to go from your garage to work every day. (/u/nzahn1 provided [additional recommendations.](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/1kxu7oq/firsttime_ev_buyers_guide/muwjzjg/))

# Do your research
Once you have a handle on your needs (miles of range, fast charging needs, etc.) you can start to actually look into cars. If you are new to EVs, you should contact a dealer and test drive one, ASAP. Doesn't even matter what kind, just go and try it. You'll never forget the first time you put the pedal to the floor in a Hyundai and it accelerates like a Porsche.  

Obviously, you'll have your own price range and vehicle preferences, but here's what you should know about the electric side of things. I would recommend starting with a filter for range and price, and survey which vehicles are in your budget that meet your needs. Give yourself a shortlist and then start to think about your particular use case, considering the following: 


* Maximum fast charging speed (sometimes called DCFC speed): Ignore this if you only plan on charging at home, because it determines your maximum speed at a fast charger. Usually given in kilowatts (kW) or alternatively described by ""10% to 80% charge time"", this is the *peak* charging rate. A number of 50 kW is almost unbearably low (60+ minutes to recharge), while 150 is solid and 200+ is as fast as they come (<20 minutes to recharge). This stat is not standardized so it has to be individually researched for each model you're interested in, and it's worth keeping in mind that it's a *maximum* value, which is affected by things like temperature and how many other people are charging. One thing that might be helpful is to go on PlugShare and check out the specific charging stations you expect to use. The app encourages ""check-ins"" from real users where they report their vehicle information as well as how their charge went. 

* ""Fuel"" efficiency: For ICE vehicles, miles per gallon (MPG) is a useful metric for showing the cost of running the vehicle. It's somewhat less important for EVs because electricity is generally cheaper than gas, but can be valuable information to know. Unfortunately, there are 3 metrics for this in EVs right now that all represent the same thing. Here's the short version: MPGe is an attempt to bridge the gap between gas and electric, so the raw number is mostly meaningless for anything besides comparison. Bigger number is better, typically above 100 MPGe. Miles per kilowatt-hour (mi/kWh) is my favorite, since it's just miles/gallon but swapped to the common unit for electric energy. Bigger is better, and numbers range from ~2 for trucks and go up to ~5 for efficient sedans. You can invert it and get kWh/mi, and since this is a decimal it's often shown as kWh/100 miles. For this, *smaller* is better, and numbers range from 20 to 50. Vehicle-specific subreddits are usually a good source of people reporting their numbers, although be aware that people tend to self-report their good numbers more than their bad ones. 

* Understand what the ""range"" number means practically: EVs are more efficient in the city than on the highway, by a significant margin. This is because EVs are more affected by aerodynamics, and going faster will steadily eat into your range. Most ""highway range"" numbers are given for fairly conservative speeds of 65-70 mph, so if you want to go 80, you'll shrink your range (conversely, EV drivers will commonly ""extend"" their range if needed by simply going slower). Electric motors and batteries also get less efficient in the cold, by like 20-30%. Combined, this means that a car with 300 miles of advertised range will get an absolute maximum of ~200 miles of range in cold weather, and that's if you're charging to 100% and driving it down to 0%. Rain, wind, and snow are also killers for aerodynamic reasons. Good practice is to just cut the advertised number in half if you plan to do winter road trips and want to know the most reliable, practical range. Elevation and weather are also usually important. I recommend finding YouTube ""range tests"" of the type of car you want. There are tons of these online. 

* Full Self-Driving (FSD) capability: This is worth a mention basically because of Tesla, although other automakers are starting to offer some functionality, and the EV customer base makes for a good ""early adopter"" test market. It can be a very attractive feature, especially if you do a lot of driving. For reviews, I would watch some videos on your specific model or go to the vehicle-specific subreddit and ask around. This one is also really important to evaluate in a test drive. 

* Plug type: This is last because it's less important, since adapters exist, but you should know if the vehicle you want uses the NACS (also known as SAE J3400) or CCS plug type (SAE J1772). In the US in 2023, Tesla convinced everyone to adopt theirs as standard, which definitely won't be annoying for anyone. Starting in 2025, many new vehicles will be releasing with this plug type, and from 2026 on, most manufacturers that I'm aware of have committed to it exclusively (within the US). If you see a ""CHAdeMO"" plug type, run away; CHAdeMO isn't real, it can't hurt you. ^^Just ^^kidding ^^the ^^Leaf ^^is ^^fine, ^^just ^^kind ^^of ^^outdated ^^at ^^this ^^point. 

# How to charge

During your vehicle research process, you should also, in parallel, determine how you're going to charge at home. You may already be aware of the different ""levels"": Level 1 charging is a basic wall outlet, Level 2 usually has a dedicated breaker and is basically a high voltage/amperage outlet, like you would get for industrial equipment. Level 3 is DC charging, and these are exclusively for public charging. To give some loose numbers, in order to add 50 miles of range, Level 1 takes 10-15 hours, Level 2 takes 2-5 hours, and level 3 takes less than an hour. 

**Many people can get by with basic level 1 charging, and do not need to spend ~$1000 on installing level 2 charging in their home**. Evaluate your daily driving, and how long your vehicle is parked at home. You still might want level 2 charging if you do anything that adds big spikes of driving into your schedule. It sucks to get back from a road trip and stress that you won't be charged enough to get to work the next day, or to leave for a road trip and *not* be at 100% because you charged too slow. 

If your garage doesn't have electric hookups or your breaker box is in a weird spot in your basement or something, it will become quite expensive to install level 2 charging. Usually, it costs something like $400 for the hardware itself and $200-800 for basic installation. If you want specifics on which chargers are good, consult /r/evcharging. If nothing else, know that you need to ensure your equipment meets certain safety specs, so look for UL or ETL standards under product specs. 

Edit: Also, as /u/IM_Oscar_dot_com said, many states and/or utility companies offer incentives to help you set up charging stations in your home. See if you qualify before installation! 

# Making the purchase
Once you've drilled down on the vehicle you want, there's a few additional considerations that happen when you've fully locked in on the car you want and are ready to buy. 

* Tax credits: Although not relevant after Dec. 31 2025, [there are currently federal credits for EVs](https://www.irs.gov/clean-vehicle-tax-credits), both new and used. Read the link if interested, but the three big things you should know are: 1) there are requirements on your income and the vehicle price, 2) There's some other requirements based on the vehicle model year (if used) or country it was manufactured in (if new), and 3) for new vehicles there's a ""lease loophole"" that's fairly easy to take advantage of. Everyone's case is different, so just ask if you have more questions here. Lastly, be careful when shopping, since some dealers will incorporate the tax cut into the advertised price (assuming you qualify for the income requirements), while some do not. 

* General trends with EV sales (May, 2025): The big thing right now is that depreciation on EVs is relatively high compared to the rest of the car market (and doubly so for Teslas). Importantly, this is not for technical reasons. EV [battery degradation is minimal](https://www.geotab.com/blog/ev-battery-health/), electric motors are theoretically more reliable than gas with fewer moving parts, and 94% of people who have an EV plan to stay with EVs. However, EVs still occupy a bit of an ""early adopter"" niche, so the people who want them are more likely to buy new. Long story short - lease or buy a gently used vehicle for the best bang for your buck. But, like, I'm not your dad or anything, do what you want. 

* Test drive: Do not buy your first EV without a significant test drive. If you've done your research well, you'll likely know more about the vehicle than the sales rep. Try out different levels of regenerative braking. Sit with the tech interface for a bit, and see if anything pops out as annoying. Try the self-driving. If there are different drive modes, give them a test. Most people dislike one-pedal driving at first but fall in love with it later, so just leave that off if you can. Also, after driving it for 10-15 minutes, look at what the range is projecting and the current battery percentage. Use those numbers to get the range at 100%, and see how that stacks up with your expectations. This isn't 100% reliable, but it can be used for a quick check. 

#Common courtesies

/u/polymath-nc made a good point about EV common courtesy things. Like at a busy gas station, it's polite to move your car as soon as its done pumping. For EVs, there's a few other things that might not be obvious to you: 

* Don't charge to 100% at a DCFC charger, especially if there are others waiting. They slow down dramatically as the car approaches 100%, so you're just you're just wasting everyone's time (including yourself!). It's always going to be faster to drive down to <10% and then charge until the charging slows down (usually ~80%). 

* If you have a relatively slow charging vehicle (Bolt is a common example with a max speed of 50 kW), you should be considerate when using fast chargers. If you have a choice between a 100 kW charger and a 350 kW charger, it won't make any difference to you which you use, while an Ioniq will take twice as long to charge at the 100 kW charger. 

* CHAdeMO plugs are relatively rare and often included as a second cable on a CCS charger. If you've got a CCS/NACS vehicle, treat it like the handicapped stall in the bathroom (they are using CHAdeMO after all), where you should use it only if the other chargers are full. 

* Many Supercharger stations have short cords because they were optimized for Teslas, meaning that non-Teslas might have to take up two spaces to connect to their vehicle. If they can (again, handicapped stall logic), Tesla users should leave the end spots open to minimize this, and non-Tesla users should use those end spots rather than take up two spaces.

How Long Does It Take To Add 300km In A BEV-only car?
Yesterday, I timed how long it takes me to fill up my Toyota at a gas station. The card tap took 7 seconds. The cashier took another 11 seconds to authorize the pump. Finally, it took about 1 min 35 sec to add just over 50 liters, which the dash told me added 530 km.

I feel like a plug in hybrid is the best type of EV for me. I can electrify my work commute (90%) driving while keeping the benefits of combustion (including free cabin heating in the winter), reliability (Toyota) and spending less money on a heavy, depreciating*** asset (battery).

I don't think the market currently sells a BEV-only car that I wish to buy. A plug-in hybrid 7+ seater Van would be my perfect car. I don't think it exists yet.

***edit: ... and although cars themselves depreciate (not applicable for the car I bought in 2020), batteries depreciate more so than an average Toyota/Honda."

Realistic long term ownership outlook
I have always been someone to buy a slightly used car, and keep it until it costs more to repair than keep person. I don’t need the latest tech, etc. I want safety, reliability and a reasonably comfortable ride. 

I have combed through all the posts and see the broad consensus that (as long as you drive a low enough mileage per year, which I do) it makes more sense to lease than buy. 

 I can buy a good-enough-for-me two or three year old EV for just slightly more than three years of leasing, if I keep the car  five or six years then buying used becomes a clear win. 

What I’m not clear on though, is what the long term outlook is for maintenance of EVs. What type of repair bills are people encountering when they start to hit year 5-8? I realize batteries are still under warranty at that point but there are so many electrical systems for all the things, and I’m wondering how often they start to fail and rack up repair bills etc.

EV9 Land or R1T Tri Max for extended roadtrip?
Trying to compare the two for a long roadtrip leaving the Rocky Mountains headed to the West Coast and back. 

I anticipate using Tesla chargers where possible for reliability and quantity. If so, the Rivian would charge faster than the Kia, right? I’ve read the Kia might be limited to < 84kW speed where the Rivian would go significantly faster. 

But taking the Kia, maybe we just don’t rely on Tesla SC and charge its 100kWh battery faster using non Tesla SC chargers?

Anyone well versed in the different architectures to share some wisdom?

If there was a 24 Hour of Le Mans Race for mostly stock BEV Compact Crossovers which car do you think would win?
Basically the same format as the traditional race but using their (fastest trim) BEV Compact Crossovers mostly stock except obvious safety modifications like a roll cage and each Pit having each vehicle using an equivalent compatible supercharger. Which vehicles do you think would make the podium? 

I think this is a fun discussion to think about with so many different performance BEV’s out there and unlike other races you find on YouTube it would also factor in battery size, possibly regen braking tactics, charging speed, and overall reliability of the vehicle. "

Zeekr 001 Premium AWD – Cruise Control Glitchy in 1.0.1? Does 1.2 Fix It?

Hey everyone,

I recently test drove the Zeekr 001 Premium AWD (European version) and while I was very impressed with the performance, comfort, and design — I noticed something odd with the cruise control / adaptive cruise system.

The car I tried was running software version 1.0.1, and the adaptive cruise felt a bit glitchy or inconsistent, especially in slow traffic. The braking and acceleration didn’t feel as smooth or confident as I expected. For comparison, I also drove the Hyundai Ioniq 5 AWD, and its cruise system felt much more refined and natural.

So I’m wondering:
	•	Is this cruise control behavior normal for the Zeekr 001 on earlier firmware?
	•	How’s the software experience overall — any bugs, delays, or odd UI decisions?
	•	Does the 1.2 update actually fix the cruise control issues or improve drive assist features?
	•	How does it compare to other EVs you’ve tested (Ioniq 5, Model Y, BMW i4, etc)?
	•	If you own one: are you happy with it after a few months? Any regrets or surprises?

Also, if anyone has alternative suggestions in the ~220,000 QAR (~€55,000) range that offer great tech, smooth driver assist, and long-term reliability — I’d love to hear them!"

Anyone running off-grid solar without a battery to charge their EV?
(EDIT: added reasons for off grid, no battery) I’m exploring a setup to charge a Tesla directly from off-grid solar **without any battery buffer** (longer story below why it has to be that way...) — just solar panels (approx. 9 panels at 360-400W on a virtually flat, unshaded roof in NorCal), a grid-forming inverter, and something like OpenEVSE to manage charge rate based on available solar.

Looking for input from anyone who’s done this:

* What gear are you using?
* How reliable is charging (especially with variable sun on cloudy days)?
* Any automation tips to avoid inverter overload?
* Lessons learned?

Trying to build a lean system with no battery bank — would love to hear from others who’ve made it work (or tried and gave up).

  
Reasons for off grid and no battery: This is for an HOA garage w common electricity, grid tying it would have virtually no positive impact for me.  I have one bay and am looking into having solar panels on the roof above my spot. There is no room for a battery inside my allocated part of the garage, also some members have expressed concerns about having batteries so I would have to go through the process of convincing them. I am looking at this as a simple(?) way to trickle charge without having to pay for a separate metered connection (requirement from HOA if I grid tie) as well as PG&E rates. By not grid tying I am also hoping for a faster permitting process. 

TIA!

Autel Charger Experience
Hello everyone,

I wanted to share my frustrating experience with the Autel AC Lite 50A hardwired charger.

I purchased it directly from the Autel website (which I wouldn’t recommend). Unfortunately, it wasn’t available on Amazon at the time, or I would have gone that route.

We had just moved into our new home (built in 2017), and I needed a reliable way to charge our two Subaru Solterras. This charger seemed like a good fit — until things quickly went downhill.

The charger arrived about a week after ordering, and I had it installed shortly after. Everything was done professionally: the installation was inspected, signed off, and finalized with some drywall work by a licensed electrician.

Both the inspector and electrician were great — experienced and thorough.

Then, two weeks later, the charger completely stopped working.

I called the electrician, who came out the same day. He tested the power — everything was fine — but the unit showed no lights and wouldn’t connect via Bluetooth. He offered to reinstall a new unit if I could get a replacement.

That’s when the real headache began — dealing with Autel customer support.

I called and waited on hold, only to be asked to leave my number for a callback. That call never came.

I followed up via email, answering their questions about the installation, amperage, wiring, etc. Then — silence. I followed up again, asking for an update. Still nothing. Finally, I sent a desperate email explaining that I needed to charge my car and this was causing serious inconvenience.

Weeks have passed, and I haven’t received a single response since.

At this point, I’m completely stuck and extremely disappointed with how Autel has handled (or ignored) this situation.

Has anyone else had a similar experience?

Also, if you have any recommendations for a reliable EV charger brand, I’m all ears. I need to replace this unit and just want something that works — and comes with actual customer support.

Driving from Edmonton to Toronto, looking for advice
Next month I'm driving my 2024 Hyundai Kona EV from Edmonton to (near) Toronto for a music festival.

I know it would be cheaper to fly, but I want to do this for the experience. So far the longest drive I've done was from Edmonton to Tofino last summer.

Planning my route, staying in Canada the whole way on the Yellowhead and Transcanada highways. It'll be 3,300km so I'm giving myself 4 days, stopping on average every 200km to rapid charge, and making sure to start with a 100% every day. I'm most worried about the stretch from Winnipeg to Thunder Bay.

Anyone driven parts of this route? Any pointers? How reliable are the charging stations on the way? Any horror stories?"

I'm a lobbyist, here's the EV tax credit repeal proposal
**EDIT: Full text supposed to be released tomorrow/Monday May 12 at 2pm**

I have kept this subreddit informed with posts over the last few years as it relates to the big tax bills and impact on EV credits.

The House Ways and Means Committee is going to mark-up their tax title this week. This is what is circulating **\*as of TODAY\*** from a reliable source. I cannot stress enough that this is fluid: it has to get through committee, then the House floor, then the Senate which is an entire other can of worms. Heck, this may change overnight so please take with a grain of salt. Although I will say that EV credits have near-unanimous Republican opposition in both chamber so I think directionally this is reasonable.

The following credits will terminate on December 31, 2025:

* Previously-owned clean vehicle credit
* Clean vehicle credit
   * Exception for vehicles which the manufacturer has not sold 200,000 by December 31
* Qualified Commercial clean vehicle credit
* Alternative fuel vehicle refueling property credit

I have not seen text, only a summary outline. This is all I have until tomorrow when I will likely see full text. However, from this it seems that anyone who wants the credit will have until year-end to take delivery of the vehicle. This is much better than what they did last time where it was as-of the date the bill was introduced, so there was no reaction time for consumers.

I'm not sure what the sub-bullet under Clean Vehicle Credit is, but possibly going back to old framework that supported early EVs for each manufacturer (first 200,000 EVs sold by Ford get a credit, others do not)."

Why most of the ev brands are plagued by 12v batterry and ICCU issues?
I drive an ICE vehicle currently but have been looking to make the switch to EV but following through different forums, it seems like almost every brand is plagued by issues related to failure in 12v battery and/or ICCU. Why is this such a prominent issue that no brand is able to figure out a reliable solution to it? I mean some of these vehicles and brands are successfully operating on impressive feats of engineering but seems like this 12v battery issue is either not being given enough importance and/or they are unable to figure out a reliable solution.

Reading stories of people getting stuck unable to open their vehicles or other impacts is whats making me rethink if this is the right time to jump in on ev vehicles. We have 2 young kids and often go on road trips to far places. Getting stuck in a remote place is worst case scenario when you have young kids.

What are your thoughts on this issue with 12v battery and ICCU failures?

Edit: Intention of my question was not to take pot shot on any brand or ev vehicles in general. Its just to get myself a clear understanding of why is this such an issue which often leads to car being towed to service center. By saying ""most brands"", I am not saying all brands but just that a significant number of brands are either having this or have had this."

4th BEV & def my favorite
This is my fourth EV, and honestly, it’s probably the one I’ve liked the most. I’ve been into electric vehicles for a while, and the Charger feels like the first one that actually feels like a car with an electric powertrain, not just an EV designed for efficiency. 


I know this car is controversial because of the electric powertrain but the high output hurricane i6 was announced when the EV was announced. I say that to answer the question that I see a lot which is “who’s this car for?” ME. 

Growing up, I played Need for Speed and Midnight Club, printing out pictures of Lamborghinis, Corvettes, and Ferraris, old muscle cars and stapling them together into a flipbook. I loved hot wheels, I just loved cars. My first car didn’t come until I got to my first duty station, a 2007 Ford Edge SEL lmao (no credit and on a budget), Since then, I’ve owned a few Toyotas, Honda, ram and as I started to make more money EVs started really rolling out. 


I still remember test driving an EV for the first time, just smiling the entire drive, and so that’s what I ended up buying, got a house and charger installed and never really looked back. 


My first EV was a Mustang Mach-E GT. It was fun when it worked, but it had the well-known HVJB issue that hit a lot of early builds. I eventually traded it in because of that.


After that, I had a 2022 Tesla Model Y, which I enjoyed a lot from a tech perspective but Elon.. so I took advantage  of Ford’s aggressive rebates on the F-150 Lightning and got that. The Lightning was smooth and well put together. My only real complaint was the tech feeling like a downgrade after coming from Tesla. Also the steering wheel has like 18 buttons but not a pause / play button for your music, why ford?


The older I get the more I appreciate convenience and having an EV charger at home just makes car ownership better. So when Dodge announced the charger I was immediately interested . I’ve been wishing for a two-door EV for a long time, and I just thought this one looked great, inside and out. Hated the interior of the old charger / challengers. 


Things I Really Like


Interior: spacious and clean, the ambient lighting is nice af. 


Fratzonic Exhaust: I know this one’s hit or miss, but I actually like it. Whether it’s just sitting idle or when you shut it down, you can feel the rumble. The startup and shutdown sounds make you smirk the first time you hear it, they sound wild, especially in a closed garage. The Mach E had a fake exhaust sound inside the car and it sounded atrocious. It’s also a nice change of pace from silence.


Overall Feel: This is easily the best-looking car  (ICE / EV) I’ve owned. Most EVs go for rounded, aero designs, which some look good, don’t get me wrong but I like that this car doesn’t give that. The proportions of the vehicle look a little off from the side but it’s doesn’t bother me that much. 


I drove 650 miles to buy this car. On the way there, I was in my Lightning, which had Apple Maps route planning and access to both Tesla Superchargers. Everything went smoothly.


On the return trip in the Charger, no Supercharger access and no built-in Apple Maps routing. I had to manually plan my stops between chargers, but it worked out fine. All the stations I used were reliable, and I made it back without issues.

Probably be my biggest suggestion to dodge / stellantis, get customers access to the Tesla charging network.

Also, figure out how to get the new charger added into Apple Maps. I’ve already submitted a request with Apple. Not sure who initiates that, Apple or manufacture. 


The main problem I’ve had is the 12V battery drain, which seems to be affecting a number of early builds. Mine has already spent a short time at the dealership because of it. Stellantis is supposed to be working on a software fix, and once that rolls out, should be problem free, I hope.


Also, Shout out to all the manufactures that haven’t blocked CarPlay. That pay to play is lame. "

I just test-drove a 2025 Model Y Juniper LR in Vienna, Austria: If nothing changes with the ADAS, it's not for me at all.
*Alternate Title: A long & rambly test-drive experience of the 2025 MYLR from someone who barely cares about cars and would prefer not being a beta-tester on public roads.*

# TL;DR:

* The ADAS Experience (as of 16/4/25) is **significantly** worse than in our 2022 MYLR (v2025.8.7).
* Almost as many false positives, but much less manual control/granularity.
* The small creature-comfort-upgrades, while nice (especially the ventilated front seats & electronically folding back seats) do not compensate for the markedly more frustrating ADAS experience.
* Some may like the new suspension but I did not like the floaty/boaty feel.

# Background

There are a lot of things that we like about our current 2022 MYLR. Other EVs that are approximately the same size somehow have less ""usable"" space on the inside (for our needs) - e.g. some (like the ID4) prioritise passenger-space and sacrifice usable trunk space, others (like the Ioniq 5) have a Frunk that isn't partciularly useful, and other still (like the Enyaq) have back seats that don't fold down as flat (or so it was when we were shopping around in 2021). We've already camped in the car twice and loved it. I like how smooth it is to drive, the one-pedal experience is very nicely tuned, and the software is snappy and responsive. It charges fast when it needs to and can drive longer than my lower-back can without a break. I love being able to integrate it with HomeAssistant via TeslaMate & MQTT.

However, the ADAS System's god-awful onslaught of false-positives and its lack of manual-control-granularity is something that I genuinely loathe about Tesla's ADAS Philosophy.

# Complaints with the 2022 MYLR's ADAS:

When using TACC in Vienna (or any other town in Austria, really), the car **constantly** slams on the brakes for vehicles parked on the side of the road, for pedestrians on sidewalks (I've even had it hard-brake & issue a forward collision warning for a jogger on a pedestrian bridge), and a plethora of other random bullshit. This 2022 vehicle that we dropped €60,000 on has a cruise-control system that I find **less trustworthy** than the cruise control system in my second-hand, €5,000 2010 Hyundai i10, simply because it's trying (and spectacularly failing) to be ""smart"".

I was at a service appointment at Tesla today - they wanted to check the car's hardware out because I've been having (inconsistent & hard to reproduce) issues with connectivity (the modems sometimes simply refuse to initialise & I need to steering-wheel-knobs-reset the car), the TACC system is frustrating at best and dangerous at worst, and the speed-limit detection has been either **not improving** or getting significantly worse with each update, making Lane-Keep basically unusable.

For the unaware - at some point, Tesla, in all their infinite wisdom, decided that (when using Lane Keep) it was a good idea to restrict the Cruise Control Set Speed to whatever the car detected the current Speed Limit to be (with an allowance of +10 kmph over that detected limit). So for example, if the car thinks that a 5-lane 130 kmph Autobahn is a 50-zone for whatever reason, then it **may or may not** drop (and restrict) the Cruise Control's set speed to 50 kmph while you're going 130 kmph. I hope I do not need to explain why this (and especially the inconsistency in the car's behaviour) may be a bit of a safety-issue.

Look, I get it - computer vision isn't an easy problem to solve, especially when you're dealing with just one type of sensor and don't even have a proper stereoscopic setup. I don't expect the solution to be on point & I'm not in a rush to have a perfect system. Just give me **the option** to turn said imperfect system off and everyone's happy. You're free to let your systems run in shadow-mode and gather data to train your models and I'll happily test them out when there's a new version. But till it's reliable enough and behaves consistently enough, **let me use normal cruise control** especially in places where **I know** your ADAS currently fails.

I intentionally scheduled my appointment a month from when I opened the ticket and had my issues acknowledged by Tesla. In the mean time, I sent Tesla (at their request) several tens of videos showing instances of each of the issues I was having. The modems not initialising, the incessant false-positives, the completely broken speed-limit detection, the car randomly dropping the Cruise Control Set Speed to some random value with no user input when using Lane-Keep on the Autobahn (sometimes even without the detected speed limit changin), all of it. The Werkstattsleiter wanted to hear about all of this in more detail. We spoke at length and I mentioned how frustrated I am with the system, how disappointed I am that I cannot switch it off, and how I am genuinely thinking of ditching Tesla in general. After hearing me out, he said they would check the hardware to rule any issues out, and that it would take \~less than an hour. I decide to wait (I live \~40 minutes away returning home only to have to come back immediately wasn't ideal). As I had time to kill and as they had a 2025 MYLR (Juniper) on hand, he offered me a test drive claiming that its systems work MUCH better than our 2022 MYLR, and that I might want to check it out before deciding to ""ditch Tesla"".

# The Juniper

Just so we're clear on my perspective when evaluating a vehicle: I genuinely could not care less about what a car looks like from the outside. I'm entirely indifferent towards ""interiors"", ""build quality"", ""panel gaps"", ""speed"" and most of those kinds of things. I drive in chill mode. I do not baby our car. I have a solution for the lack of buttons (thanks, enhauto), and almost literally everything is nicer than my 2010 Hyundai i10. I see our car as a utility. It needs to get me from Point A to Point B, it needs to be able to haul things I want it to haul, and it needs to do what I want it to do without it getting in my way. I am satisfied with all but one aspect of our current car (that does indeed get in my way), and the Juniper is almost functionally identical in most other ways. So, I decided to focus on testing just that one aspect of out.

It's **so much worse** than our 2022 MY. **SO MUCH WORSE.** It's safe to say that I loathe the new implementation of the ADAS significantly more than the one in our car.

# An even more ""all or nothing"" philosophy

In the 2022 MY, when I want to change lanes while using TACC+LaneKeep, I indicate (which reduces the steering-wheel-resistance required to disable LaneKeep), slighty nudge the wheel which deactivates LaneKeep but keeps TACC active (so I maintain my current speed), I move over to the new lane, and then reactivate LaneKeep (by double-pressing the right stalk).

I cannot do this in the Juniper. There is no ""single-click is TACC and double-click is TACC+LaneKeep"" setting anymore. You can either have ""single click toggles TACC"" or you can have ""single-click toggles both TACC+LaneKeep as one package"". There are no inbetweens. You therefore always need to have a foot on the pedal when deactivating LaneKeep or else regen will kick in & you'll start slowing down. Additionally, you now have all of the restrictions that LaneKeep brings with it, meaning you can no longer use ""just"" TACC in situations where some kind of cruise control would be helpful, but LaneKeep isn't available (so almost every single 30 zone & several 50-zones in Vienna & most other Austrian cities/towns/villages). Sure, I can switch the ADAS to TACC-Only mode, but I cannot turn TACC+LaneKeep-mode (they call it ""Autosteer Beta"") on again without first shifting to Park.

This is a straight downgrade in my driving experience.

# And yet, just as many false-positives

Despite the Juniper having an additional front-bumper camera (which I would love to have retrofitted in our car) and the camera feeds having better image quality, Juniper still has just as many false positives. It still hard-slams the brakes for vehicles parked on the side of the road (regardless of whether I'm on TACC or TACC+LaneKeep), it is still very antsy around cyclists that are **inside a cycling lane**, it still cannot consistently & correctly identify speed limits (both cars think 90% of Vienna is a 30-zone), and it still comes to a **complete fucking stop** in the middle of the road when it sees a truck **parked in a clearly demarkated parking spot**. All of these issues are **significantly** worse when using LaneKeep+TACC so when driving our car, I usually just stick to using TACC and activate LaneKeep only on parts of my commute that I know I can trust LaneKeep. But with Juniper, I would not be able to do this.

Another downgrade in my driving experience.

# You will eat your FCWs & you will like them!

Every time I get into our 2022 MYLR, the very first thing I do is pull up the menu, navigate to the ""Autopilot"" section, and swith ""Forward Collision Warning"" and ""Lane Departure Avoidance"" off. Both of these features are beyond broken out here and any time I forget to switch them off, the car is very prompt to show me how much worse my driving experience can be with them switched on. It will yell about most parked vehicles. It will yell about random pedestrians. It will panic about cars waiting to turn on to the main road. It will have a mental breakdown and slam on the brakes for cars trying to merge on to the highway. Several roads here have cycling lanes that ""eat into"" the main lane - the idea is that if there are no cyclists in the cycling lane, cars can drive with their right-wheels in that cycling lane (you effectively pretend it doesn't exist). Some roads don't have a median at all and will have two cycling lanes on each side. The car cannot cope with this. It will screech at me and try to steer me out of the cycling lane unless I turn that damn feature off. I've had situations were it's thrown a lane-departure-warning when I've been trying to turn **with my indicator turned on**. I know several parts of my commute where these situations are very reliably reproducable, so I decided to check how Juniper responds.

It responds in almost exactly the same way.

But now, there's no way to switch ""Forward Collision Warning"" off anymore. 

*What the actual fuck.*

# But you should have tested FSD! It's so much better!!1!1!!1

No. 

Let's ignore the fact that, as of time of writing, it's basically vaporware out here in Europe. I want MORE granularity when it comes to manual-control not LESS. 

I do not mind using my think-noodle. I enjoy using this steering wheel that I paid for, and I do not mind managing distance from vehicles in front of me. Believe it or not, I do like driving. I just want to rest my ankle every now and then, especially when I'm done climbing, bouldering, or snowboarding.

I don't have FSD on my current vehicle. I do not intend to have it on my next vehicle. In fact, I do not even intend to buy EAP.

I literally just want CC, TACC, and LaneKeep, and the option to pick and choose which ones of those I activate depending on my circumstances.

# But... But... Butt... SoFtWaRE UpDAtes!!!1!

Sure. It's possible that some of these downgrades will be fixed via software updates. Tesla even has a mostly-amazing track record of issuing them. They do tend to break things once in a while, but fixes do come around eventually (unless you're the Auto-Wipers). That said, I do not like evaluating products based on the promise of future improvements. I did not evaluate the 2021 MYLR based on it's potential to get software updates when we test drove it (RIP v10) and I see no reason to hold the Juniper to different standards.

Is this unrealisitically pesimistic? Perhaps, perhaps not. I would much rather err on the side of caution, especially knowing that Tesla has, in fact, disabled features via Software in the past (e.g. Radar, 12V Accessory Power, the ability to disable Automatic Emergency Braking when using LaneKeep, etc.). Updates are a double-edged sword. Yes, things *can* get better, but they *can* also get much worse. I would rather evaluate a product as it is as of time of evaluation.

# So then a Tesla isn't for you!1!!!!1!

Yes, I am afraid that, as of time of writing, the Juniper isn't for me. As much as I like the fact that the frunk has a drain port (and all of the use cases I can imagine for it), that my passengers can control the climate & seat heating without having to ask me, that I won't be as sweaty in the summer, and that I can have the back seats lift themselves, having **less** manual control of the ADAS system is an objective downgrade for the way I like to interact with my vehicle.

There are many things I like about the Juniper. The current implementation of the ADAS system is absolutely not one of them and it is for sure a deal-breaker.

By the time our 2022 MYLR kicks the bucket, I genuinely hope something changes. Either in Tesla's willingness to give their users more manual control of the ADAS & so-called ""sAfEtY"" systems, or with how other manufacturers use the space in their similarly sized vehicle offerings."

Vegas hotels with charging?
I've done a few road trips from Salt Lake City to southern California and haven't been super impressed with the charging available at hotels in Las Vegas.  Too busy to find an open charger, expensive, booked out, etc.  So we've actually usually stopped in Southern Utah for the night.

But we're going again in a few months and my wife wants to stay in Vegas.  I've spent hours on Plugshare and hotel review sites, looking for a good hotel that has a reliable charger--even just a level 2 we can park at night and leave until morning.

I think I've found one or two, but I just feel like I'd like some help.  Any suggestions for hotels in Vegas with good, reliable charging?  Thanks."

Ioniq XRT vs Mach E Rally (2025)
Just came home with my new 2025 Ioniq 5 XRT and wanted to talk a bit about my considerations with why I went with the Ioniq and was also curious what other people's thoughts are. Haven't seen a lot about either of these trims so figured I'd get the conversation rolling.

XRT Pros:
- Better approach angle
- Better tow hooks (opinion)
- Faster charging
- NACS native plug
- physical buttons
- Better efficiency (Battery to range ratio)

Mach E Rally Pros:
- Better sound
- More cargo
- Blue cruise (if you like that sorta thing)
- More range
- More storage
- Cross climate 2 tires
- Aesthetics (opinion)

My Final Decision:
My main use case for this car is to drive in the snow (Bay Area to Tahoe). Both models have a snow mode, both models have awd, and both have a 1 inch lift. Those features are what put these cars on my list. Although the mach E has more cargo it's only a 2 cubic feet. I am coming from an accord so both models have significantly more cargo space than my current car. Blue cruise is cool, but I am a bit of a skeptic with self driving and generally would only use it in the same way I use cruise ctrl now. The range has me questioning for a while. Ultimately it came down to logistics. Traveling to tahoe and back on either EV would require me to charge at least once. If that's the case id rather take the faster charging one. To that point, the native NACS port on the ioniq is very convenient. Tesla chargers are just so much more reliable and accessible and not having to put on an adapter when it's 30 degrees is a plus. The tires were another big factor I had to consider. Cross climates aren't cheap and that extra $1000 or so is something to consider when comparing prices between the two. However I was able to do a bit of haggling on the Ioniq and was able to get them to give me 1k off the final price which I'm going to put towards CC2's and will probably sell current tires for a good discount."

Do We Even Need Five-Minute EV Charging?
When is fast charging fast enough?  BYD has promoted 5 minute charging to 250 miles of range, but I'd argue that EV charging is different than gasoline fill-ups.  With gas you always have to visit a station, and every minute you stand by the pump is a wasted minute.

With EV charging, you (assuming you normally charge at home) are probably on a trip and will be spending 10-15 minutes hitting the potty and maybe buying snacks and drinks...even just stretching and taking the dog out for a break.  Once EVs can charge 10-80% in that timeframe I think the problems to solve relate to ubiquitous availability and reliability, not speed."

Thoughts from 6.5k mile road trip from Houston to Banff through Utah, Colorado, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, South Dakota Nebraska, Kansas and Oklahoma
As summer approaches, I'm sure some of us will be embarking on a long road trips. I'm writing this post to help those people on the fence about taking their EV or not.

I have a 2021 Ford Mustang Mach-E GT PE (official range only 260 miles) and took it on a looong road trip last summer from Houston up to Banff, through charging deserts (and literal deserts! lol) in Utah, Wyoming, Idaho, Montana, Nebraska, Oklahoma, and of course Texas - which imo is basically a worst case scenario for charging deserts (super rural, super um...Republican) - so if I can do it on that route, you can do it on your route!

Here was my route, planned out on ABRP: https://imgur.com/a/M4HSfQp

https://abetterrouteplanner.com/?plan_uuid=8faa54d7-2b08-4c93-8617-2f3367c075c7

The route itself was 6.5k miles, but since I was gone all summer exploring these areas, I actually put about 12.5k miles on my car.

Tips for anyone looking to do the same thing:

(1) Buy the Electrify America and/or Tesla membership - you break even in reduced charging costs in like 2 chargers. You can even sign up, then immediately un-sign up so that way you don't forget to cancel your membership before the next month starts (membership stays active for the rest of the month).

(2) For anyone planning on using Tesla supercharging - NOT ALL TESLA SUPERCHARGERS WORK WITH CCS CARS. The best way to find which ones DO is to download and use the Tesla app. You have to tell it what car you are driving, and it will then filter to only show you Tesla superchargers that will work with your car.

(3) For anyone anxious about how to find chargers en route, I found the absolute best way was to use ABRP, and then just verify that the next stop you're hitting up is working via plugshare. If you have a copilot, bonus points if you have them verify the wait time at the next electrify america or tesla station too. It was great!

~~~

Takeaways:

(1) Electrify America stations, for all the shit they get, had pretty great uptime. I only ran into a couple chargers along the way that didn't work, and when that happened, I just moved one stall over. There was only *one* time when I had to wait because all stalls were taken and even then my total wait time was 7 minutes before the first stall opened up and the Rivian waved me in.

(2) Tesla superchargers ... were actually pretty reliable and useful. However, they are annoying to use as a non-Tesla because you do have to be a dick and tie up *at least* 2 spaces. There were some that I had to pull in horizontally for and take up THREE spaces because not only was the cord short, but the curb was so high that if I pulled in, I would have hit it. This was never so big of a problem that I blocked another Tesla from charging (there were always other stalls available when I blocked 2 or 3 chargers), but I still felt a little weird about it.

(3) Unsurprisingly, charging in Colorado and in British Columbia was WAAAAY EASIER to find and use than in say ... South Dakota or Wyoming. In B.C. I was shocked at how cheap the electricity was in comparison to the elevated gas prices people were paying. It makes enormous financial sense to have EVs in B.C. and in Alberta. Kind of jealous tbh lol. And in Colorado, chargers are EVERYWHERE, even in tiny towns in the mountains like Alma, CO.

(4) If you can't find airbnbs with L2 charging (and you should try!), L1 charging off of a spare outdoor outlet actually is pretty decent. I was working remotely from lots of these places and could charge about 30% of my 90kwH battery in a 24 hour period, which was big enough to notice. There were times when I had to drive just to get my car off of 100% battery because whoops, I had charged to full without thinking about it.

(5) Taking a break every 2-3 hours made me noticeably less tired when reaching destinations. For me, I had my dog with me, so I took him on walks during this time (which is something I'd have to make time to do anyway if I had a gas car) or got snacks/fast food nearby.

(6) At campsites if you're camping with your car, you can let the car run all night with AC if it's too hot - and you'll barely make a dent in your battery. I think it cost me like 5-10% of my battery to run the AC ALLLLL night.

~~~

Noticeable cons:

(a) I won't only paint a rosy picture. There were *some* remote mountain trailheads or campsites that I could NOT access because it was more than 100 miles from the nearest charger, so that was disappointing. This was especially true in Montana and Wyoming and Idaho. If you're visiting civilization, this won't bother you - but I do like to camp and hike...

(b) My 260 mile range was really only like 160-190 miles effectively - why? Well you're usually not starting at 100% and not ending at 0% between chargers, plus that 260 mile estimated range isn't at highway speeds (where you are less efficient). This wasn't really that big of a deal, but is important to know when you are planning your road trip.

(c) There were two times when I had to backtrack and hit up a charging station because I found something cool along the way I wanted to detour to. Not gonna lie, that was a little annoying - but only twice in a 12,500 mile journey isn't that bad imo.

Once in Wyoming because I wanted to visit Fossil Butte National Monument (which was cool!); and once in South Dakota because the ABRP charger that I was linked to looked like it was offline and I didn't check until I was already en route via Plugshare. The second time around, I honestly probably could have just slowed my speed to 70mph instead of 85 and made it to the next station on my way, but I was too freaked out at the prospect of having no charge in the middle of South Dakota without reception, so I turned around 30 minutes the wrong way to hit up the closest EA station

(d) All charging stops aren't made equal. Some of them are amazing, with restaurants / shopping / a small park or walking trail nearby (BUCEEs were AWESOME for this). But others are just a gas station and concrete nearby. Also, since you're now snacking at the restaurants nearby the charger, you won't be able to do so at mom and pop shops along the way unless you explicitly stop at them now and ""waste"" time by doing so (that you could have otherwise spent charging).

~~~

Hopefully this helps make people less anxious on any road trips that they're considering this summer. I won't lie -  if you have access to an ICE vehicle *for free*, you should probably do that instead. You get places noticeably slower with an EV, both because of the charging stops and because you are more likely to drive at a more reasonable speed because you'll notice how much your efficiency drops off at 95mph vs 70mph. And you'll never have to backtrack to the nearest charger because you found a cool detour on the way.

That being said, I probably would NOT go out and rent an ICE vehicle specifically for this purpose. The road trip in the EV was really nice and really smooth and bluecruise was cool. In B.C. and Alberta specifically, I paid SO MUCH LESS in electricity (even with DCFC) than I would have in fuel. That was amazing.

Happy to answer any questions from anyone looking to do road trips in the same areas or road trips in general!"

Question for Chinese EV Owners
This is a question to any long term Chinese EV owners out there. I'm curious about Chinese EV's and how they compare to western car brands. We all see that Chinese cars have low prices and often times very flashy designs, but what are they like to own? Is the long term reliability good or bad? Being based in North America, I haven't really had any experience with Chinese cars, but I am curious about them.

* Which make/model do you own?
* How long have you owned your car?
* Where are you based in? In markets outside of China, how is the after-sales and repair support? Are spare/replacement parts easy to source?
* Has your car had any minor/major mechanical or software issues?
* Would you buy another one?

Edit - No need to answer all the questions, these are just the things that I am wondering about."

Just Traded in my Tesla for a 2025 Mini Countryman!
Another Trade in My Tesla Post:

I traded in my 2020 Model 3 Performance for Mini Countryman ALL4 Electric in what I think is a very handsome slate blue. I did really like my Tesla but it was time for a change. I got a nice lease deal and this car is waaaay more cheerful. 

What I like: The interior, HUD, infotainment, Wireless CarPlay, driving assist, fits in my garage (about the same width as a model 3 - I have a super narrow garage) 

Dislikes: Less range (about 205mi), lack of reliable charging network, infotainment.  This runs the newish OS9 from BMW. The Mini is basically a reskinned BMW iX1. Sometimes the software is better than Tesla, other times it leaves me scratching my head — why can I close windows only via Bluetooth and not WiFi or cell data for example? That said the customization options are many. 

Anyhow I’m really enjoying the new ride and love having something a bit more unique and colorful."

New US and Canadian CCS chargers in February 2025
Hey electrons,

**Here are all (\*) of the new US and Canadian CCS (Level 3 fast-charging) stations that rolled out in February 2025,** according to the US Department of Energy. You can [get the data yourself here](https://afdc.energy.gov/data_download).

These chargers are suitable for most new EVs on the market, except for:

1. Tesla drivers who haven't bought the official CCS adapter yet. Certain older Teslas need additional work done to accept the adapter.
2. Nissan Leaf owners, owners of the Mitsubishi Outlander PHEV, and some owners of older cars that also use CHAdeMO. If you drive such a car, see my matching post in r/leaf.

**Some of these chargepoints will be ""refreshes,""** e.g. the provider replaced them with faster chargers etc. Some may be incorrect. This report is only as good as the Alternative Fuels Data Center data.

**There were 178 CCS charging stations with a total of 403 chargepoints added or refreshed in February 2025.** For comparison, there were 194 new CCS charging stations in February 2024, with 408 chargepoints.

This month saw a decrease relative to February of last year, and also a decrease due to last month, but not a huge one in either case.

None of these were labeled specifically as Tesla Magic Dock stations, although some could be.

**NOTE:** most Tesla Superchargers still do NOT have magic dock as of this writing (but any that are shown in this report should have it). I recommend using the official Tesla app to locate compatible stations for your vehicle. **Be aware some stations with Magic Dock still have short cords,** which require most CCS vehicles to block two chargers.

**(\*) ""What about other Tesla Superchargers? Can't everybody charge with NACS now?""**

Tesla has said they will allow cars from participating automakers to charge at v3 and newer Superchargers without Magic Dock. Since then there has clearly been a delay in the rollout. Ford, Rivian, Hyundai and GM owners can now order adapters from the manufacturer of their vehicle. Others are coming soon.

However, since non-magic-dock superchargers are open to only *some* CCS vehicles, this report is not the place for them. If you are interested Tesla's app provides the best guide to their locations, both those that support *all* CCS vehicles and those that only support the manufacturers currently permitted to use an adapter.

**""What about non-Tesla EVs with a built-in NACS port? Can they use all superchargers?""**

So far there is only one sold in volume: the 2025 Hyundai Ioniq 5. Even with a built-in NACS port, it can only use newer superchargers (generation 3 or better). However, with this car, you do not have to block two stalls to use a short Supercharger cord, which is a big advantage.

**""Will the AFDC data continue to be available?""**

This month's data seems pretty normal at first glance. But with mass layoffs in the US federal government, it is unclear whether and how long the availability of the AFDC data feed will continue, and how complete it will be. I don't have a crystal ball or a line of communication with any current or former AFDC employees who might be able to tell us. If you're out there my Reddit DMs are open.

**Other Notes**

To streamline this post, multi-chargepoint locations are listed with the number of chargepoints first.

For serious trip planning, I recommend PlugShare. But by all means check out these reported new locations and submit reviews on PlugShare, which makes things better for everyone.

If you'd like to know about new chargers along your routes right away, or just prefer not to check this list monthly when new openings are rare in your area, I've set up a free service that provides email notifications as soon as they open. You can [sign up at evpov.com](https://evpov.com/). Or not! I don't really have a business plan here, I built it to help EV owners like myself. PlugShare has a similar feature.

Vehicle Research Resources?
I am not sure what exactly is the best way to ask this, so I am sorry in advance if this isn't in the correct place or flair. I am trying to find solid resources to compare various EVs and PHEVs not only by model, but also model year. This isn't a purchasing question, because I am actually looking parts for the sake of building a frankenEV (I have difficult hobbies) so I was looking for how to tell which platforms or model years are best known for their reliability or the opposite (years of car X known for crap motors) 

I haven't seen much beyond comparison sites talking about total cost of ownership, but if anyone knows of sites with more detailed info I would be deeply appreciative!"

Range estimates - are they reliable?
I got my Kia ev3 a week ago and the range is not at all what I expected.

I went for the long range along with the heat pump which I expected to mean 300+ miles while at 80% as the advertised range is 375.

When I picked up the car it was at 98% and had 313 miles.

I have since charged it 3 times as I do a commute of 70 miles 3 times a week.

The first time I charged it to 80% it estimated range at 250

The second time I charged it to 80% it estimated range at 232

The third time I charged it to 80% it estimated range at 216.

I know the estimated range is not something to be relied upon as it’s really a guess but I has assumed it would be much better than this.

When driving the car I’m mostly motorway driving at 70mph.
I don’t have much active in terms of climate control / I have the fan on level one to ensure the windscreen is clear and I have apple CarPlay on with the map and a podcast.

Is the range reliable or am I doing something wrong? "

Why Some Drivers Feel Threatened by the EV Transition—And Why Solar Energy Is the Future
I wrote this because I needed to share why so many people just want to ""hate"" on EVs, Elon and Tesla without discussing politics.

The transition from gasoline and diesel vehicles to electric vehicles has generated resistance from some drivers, particularly those who feel a deep attachment to internal combustion engines (ICEs). This resistance is fueled by a mix of practicality, economics, and nostalgia. Many Americans grew up with ICE vehicles, relying on their perceived reliability, simplicity, and refueling convenience. The shift to EVs represents not just a change in technology but a fundamental shift in how we interact with transportation—charging instead of pumping gas, software updates instead of oil changes, and battery range instead of fuel tank size.

The fear of the unknown plays a major role. Some worry about EV range, charging infrastructure, and battery replacement costs. Others see the EV movement as government overreach, with policies incentivizing electrification at the expense of traditional fuel industries. And of course, the oil industry itself has a vested interest in maintaining the status quo, often sowing doubt about EVs and renewable energy sources.

However, the reliance on fossil fuels comes with a price—environmentally, geopolitically, and economically. Solar energy, in contrast, offers a more sustainable and decentralized alternative. Unlike oil, which requires extraction, refining, and distribution, solar power can be harnessed directly at the point of use, reducing dependence on supply chains vulnerable to geopolitical conflicts and market fluctuations. As battery storage improves and solar panel efficiency continues to rise, more homes and businesses will generate their own electricity, making energy cheaper and more resilient to disruptions.

The complete transition to solar-based transportation energy in the U.S. won’t happen overnight. Based on current trends, including EV adoption rates, grid upgrades, and advancements in solar power, a realistic estimate is that the majority of passenger vehicles and light-duty trucks will shift to solar-sourced electricity within **25 to 40 years**. This timeline depends on improvements in energy storage, expanded charging infrastructure, and the declining cost of solar panels and batteries. While challenges remain, the direction is clear—solar energy will outcompete fossil fuels as the dominant power source for transportation.

For those hesitant about EVs, history shows that technological transitions—whether from horses to cars, landlines to cell phones, or film to digital—often face pushback before becoming mainstream. As EVs continue to improve and solar power becomes even more cost-effective, the question will shift from if the transition will happen to how soon we can make it work for everyone."

True or False: BMW EVs typically have the most reliable software
Just tried it out for kicks, haven't gone through the citations but here's what Copilot says.  I had lurked in the Taycan forum and even for 2025 models, Porsche doesn't seem to have a handle on how to fix some software issues on its EVs.

Thoughts and experiences with these German EVs and their software, in terms of operability and not so much the entertainment side?

When it comes to software reliability in EVs, each brand has its strengths and weaknesses. Here's a brief overview based on recent information:

1. **Audi**: Audi's EVs, like the e-tron, have been praised for their build quality and driving experience. However, their software has been described as problematic, with frequent issues and a steep learning curve for users[\[1\]](https://www.e-tronforum.com/threads/ordering-an-ev-should-i-be-scared-off-by-all-the-q6-problems.8274/)[\[2\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/ttsr37/one_month_owning_an_audi_etron_whats_up_with_all/).
2. **Porsche**: Porsche EVs, such as the Taycan, offer a great driving experience but have faced several software issues, including problems with the infotainment system and various glitches[\[3\]](https://rennlist.com/forums/macan-ev/1439154-software-issues.html)[\[4\]](https://www.motorbiscuit.com/porsche-taycan-ev-makes-most-unreliable-lists-based-on-complaints/).
3. **BMW**: BMW's EVs, like the i4, generally receive positive feedback for their software reliability. While there have been some issues, BMW has been proactive with over-the-air updates to address them[\[5\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/BMWI4/comments/15liwhp/thoughts_on_bmw_evs_reliability/)[\[6\]](https://caredge.com/guides/the-most-reliable-evs-according-to-consumer-reports-2025)[\[7\]](https://bmwi.bimmerpost.com/forums/showthread.php?t=2080938).
4. **Mercedes**: Mercedes EVs, such as the EQS, have a luxurious and feature-rich interior, but they have also experienced software issues, including a recent recall for a battery management system software problem[\[8\]](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/15n1sl5/my_eqs_sedan_long_term_review/)[\[9\]](https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1143376_mercedes-recalls-nearly-15-000-evs-for-software-issue).

Overall, **BMW** seems to have the most reliable software among these brands, with fewer reported issues and effective updates to resolve problems.

Do you have a specific model in mind, or are you considering multiple options?

Long Road Trip Experience with Ford Lightning
So having now completed what i consider to be a long road trip (2,700 miles roundtrip) with an EV. I have a little list of complaints/concerns.

First, i need to layout some caveats:

- For Trip Planning, i used ABRP Premium (https://abetterrouteplanner.com/)
- I used many different charging networks (7 According to my Monarch Money charges)
- The weather was very variable. As low as 20 and as high as 81.
- It was mostly highway driving.
- I have a 2023 Lariat ER. I was driving from Florida to Oklahoma and back.

TLDR; I don't think EV's are ready for replacing gas vehicles for long road trips. They are functional for this purpose, and they can work, but there are so many little issues and differences that make it less of an enjoyable experience.

# Why We use EVs

As people here of course know we use EV's for a variety of reasons. Some people like the acceleration, some like the simplicity of waking up with a full tank each day, some enjoy the cost savings of charging at home vs paying for gas.


There are a myriad of reasons why EV's are excellent commuter vehicles; unfortunately almost all of these work against them as road trip vehicles.

# What the lightning has going for it as a road trip vehicle

Though this is mostly a warning/complaint post, i have to give credit where credit is due.

- This is the most comfortable vehicle i can imagine taking a road trip in. Despite a 27 hour straight day of driving and charging i never once had my legs feel sore or go numb on me. The truck gets an absolute 10/10 score for this.
- There is ample room in the back to take a nap during charges,or even to sleep in overnight if needed. I was able to constantly steal 30-40 minute cat naps during charging stops with a blanket and a pillow in the back seat. Mind you I'm not the tallest of guys but i think your average person can make it work.
- The frunk storage is fantastic in comparison to any other truck for a road trip. Nothing gets soaking wet, you can run in and out of restrooms and restaurants without worrying about things getting stolen. I filled the built in cooler section with drinks when i left and pulled things out as needed when i stopped for charges. The frunk is amazing.
- Do you need to quickly pass 6 tractor trailers? The giddy-up makes merging/passing etc on the highway a non-issue.

# Why its a bad road trip vehicle, or maybe why all EVs are bad road trip vehicles

- The forced stops. I was, until this trip, in the camp of people who would say ""i like to stop every 2-3 hours anyhow so this is no big deal"". While that remains true, the real issue here is not getting to pick where you stop.
  - You want to eat at a certain restaurant? You are now making two stops. One at the charging station, and then one 2-3 exits later at your food place of choice. This is not an issue with a gas vehicle as there are gas stations at pretty much every exit. This completely negates the idea of ""I'll just eat while I'm charging"". Unless you get real lucky and the place you want to eat happens to be at the exit BEFORE your charger. This is very annoying even when traveling solo. I can imagine its infinitely more annoying with a wife and kids in the truck.
- Forced driving habit changes. Obviously this will be very different for everyone. I'm not a psychotic driver by any means, but i normally do not like doing the speed limit on road trips. Especially while in wide open country in the middle of America. However the loss of range at over 70 mph is catastrophic. Especially when combined with cold weather. You get used to the range you have driving around town, but expect a crushing loss on that range while doing 75 in 30 degree temperatures. This exacerbates negative #1 and when combined with my new hatred for ABRP (explained later in the post), can lead to some real shitty situations
- Gas stations always work, and are just plug & play. I can count on one hand the number of times in my life i have pulled up at a gas station and have the pumps are out of order. I believe it happened to me roughly the same amount of times with chargers on this one road trip alone.
    - Special shout out to Tesla here. Every single one of their chargers i pulled up to worked. The same CANNOT be said for Electrify America, EV GO, GM, Nayax, Chargeepoint etc. You are rolling the dice here. Before anyone says it, YES you can look at PlugShare in advance and verify if the chargers are broken, and ABRP premium will allow you to set filters around charger availability. My point is, these are not things added to your mental load when driving a gas vehicle across country.
    - Special fuck you to Tesla here. Thank you for opening up your chargers to us, but forcing us to do gymnastics to get our vehicles into a charging spot. Between the need to use two spots, and the parking blocks stopping you from pulling up all the way i eventually de-prioritized Tesla chargers even though they are the most reliable.
- One final negative about the charging issues. When taking an ICE vehicle you normally will get up in the morning at your hotel, get some breakfast, hit a gas station and get on the road with a full tank. This is not nearly as convenient with an EV. Either you need to charge it to your desired range before stopping at the hotel, or you need to get all your shit loaded up, and then stop again for 30-40 minutes before you even get going. It feels like a momentum killer.
- The cost of charging is brutal on road trips. It's 11 cents per KWH at my house, its 44-56 at the chargers i stopped at leading to some really expensive fill-ups along the way.
- All the different chargers and apps you need, often time charge you in chunks, and you end up with dead money sitting in your account with them that you may not use again for another 6 months or a year. This feels scummy as hell to me. (Looking at you Electrify America)

# ABRP is the best and worst experience with an app i have ever had.

Full disclosure here, as i know there are a lot of ABRP apologists who are going to come in here and tell me about special features i didn't use correctly, this is my first LONG roadtrip using the app.


I was excited to have it plan out all my stops for me and tell me just how long i needed to charge at each of them to help me be more efficient. I bought a Bluetooth ODB dongle to connect the truck to it for more accurate data. I went in and made sure to the best of my ability all my settings were accurate, and then i started my drive.

- Almost immediately i realized its estimate on the range i was going to have at long distance highway speeds was off. To make sure i was going to make it to the first schedule charging stop i slid over into the right lane and did the speed limit for the next 150 or so miles. I then thought ok, i will adjust the reference SOC to where its more conservative, which seemed to help some, but i was expecting the Bluetooth dongle to do this part for me in conjunction with ABRP. Very disappointing.
- Every time i stopped to charge, i had to completely close the app, and restart the navigation from scratch. Otherwise the SOC wouldn't update from where it ended. So i would constantly have it showing me starting the next leg at 15% SOC, ending at -47% and it would tell me its no longer viable. This is despite me going in and manually setting the SOC after the charge to update it. This was never once reliable for me and eventually led me to almost getting stranded.
- What it showed on my navigation screen CONSTANTLY was out of sync with what it shows on my dash. It never had the miles till stop completely synced, nor was the battery percentage matching. I spent probably 30% of my drive trying to figure this out before i just gave up."

Polestar is Best, Tesla last in Swedish (EU) car inspections for 2024.
In Sweden’s 2024 “Bilbesiktningen” (vehicle inspection), Polestar ranked first among electric car brands, while Tesla came in last in terms of defect rates. This trend has been consistent in several countries, where Tesla often scores poorly in EU vehicle inspections, while Polestar and other brands perform better.

One of the main reasons Tesla ranked so low in Sweden was its high failure rates in areas like suspension, brakes, and lights. Polestar, on the other hand, had significantly fewer defects and was rated the most reliable EV in the inspection.

It’s interesting to see how this varies by market. In the U.S., Tesla often scores higher in customer satisfaction and reliability surveys, while in Europe, stricter quality controls in vehicle inspections reveal more issues.

Including depreciation, what does it cost you to operate your BEV in your country/region?
Just wondering what it really cost owners.  I guess people in China have got one of the lowest cost of ownership with $10,000 USD BEVs.  Anyone really crunch the numbers?

Too bad there's just no way to find out how long the battery packs will last on a used BEV or if it will even be made available when the time comes.  Could be 20 years like many here suggest or could be much shorter (why 10 years from in-service date is the longest warranty or insurance coverage afforded).

Even in the US, there is no rule that forces manufacturers to keep inventory of parts for a certain time period and there lies the problem for non-volume selling BEVs that may not have a lot of third party support.

My next car will be a BEV but not until my HEV and ICEV dies noble deaths.  Cost me less than $1,500 USD a year to operate the HEV and do typical maintenance and I paid $4,000 USD to a friend in 2020.  No, it's not going to be faster, more dynamic than the average BEV but it's been rock solid reliable these past five years.

Average kilowatt-hour or dollar amount to Run AC?
Hey I tried to find out the cost of running AC in stationary EV and haven't found a reliable source.

I've been told it's around 1 Kwh to run AC for 1 hours, is this true (I know this will depend on temperature and to some degree on model, just looking for a range or average amount)."

Why are most BEV issues related to software and batteries and will next generation battery technologies really be the panacea?
I've been interested in BEVs ever since my friends got their Model S over a decade ago.  I put a security deposit on the Model 3, the day after the unveil but decided to take it back when I learned there was no heat pump or heated steering wheel for the first production year or so.

Then was interested in the Macan 4 (put a deposit) but shocked about the price delta over the ICEV Macan and that at that time, it couldn't be optioned with PTV Plus.  Then came across a few videos on YT where SMEs were interviewed and they proffered that there are at least 3 major and 15 minor degradation pathways, one even mentioned 30.  

In any case, for my use case (work and personal), a HEV (lower total ownership cost) or a BEV (can be had with better driving dynamics and advance differentials) is the way to go.  

Will some solid electrolytes (not without their own problems) really cut down degradation and get batteries to outlive the rest of the vehicle?

Mercedes and BMW just recently announced progressed on the battery front but I think 2030 is when mid-priced BEVs will come with solid electrolyte batteries.  

With lower risks of thermal runaway, software can be simpler, operating band can be wider, charging speed and reliability can be improved in the cold, etc.  Most of us came from ICEVs or HEVs in which software updates were unheard of except to reduce carbon deposit build ups.

Road trip report: 1800 mi around SW USA in an EV9 that handled it like a champ
Just finished a road trip from Bay Area, CA --> Hoover Dam --> Grand Canyon --> Sequoia National Park --> Bay Area, CA in a 2024 EV9 Land, total \~1800 mi. Went through 60F sunny CA central valley, freezing 30s F rain/snow/hail climbing 1000s ft elevation in AZ, and basically everything in between. 

For our family, the EV9 worked great as a family road trip vehicle. It's comfortable, quiet, has solid level 2 ADAS, and the kids made good use of the relaxation seats which I initially thought was a gimmick but proved handy. Not the best efficiency, 2.5-2.7 mi/kWh going 70-90 mph on highway, but charged fast enough to make up for it. Our total road trip time was more determined by traffic and our biological needs than charging. Overall would drive \~2.5 hrs and charge 15-20 min as a routine, as guided by ABRP. 

Also, Electrify America between CA, NV, and AZ worked fine for us. Kia gets NACS/Tesla access next month, and I already have the adapter, but I’m not too anxious to get it now. The main downside is some sites were busy – but we only had one stop where we had to wait and that was for literally 5 min, and the kids spent longer anyway eating their lunch at the next door restaurant. I consistently got the max \~200-210 kW flat charging the EV9 handles at 350 kW stations; even got 176 kW out of a 150 kW stall. 

 

Plus:

·      I don’t think there’s a material difference between Tesla road tripping and Hyundai/Kia EV road tripping. We did a similar length road trip in a rented Model X a couple years ago and I don’t think we had a significance net difference of experience of time/convenience between the two. I’m sure Lucid would be even better. And it was unanimous that the EV9 is much more comfortable than the Model X.

·      I also don’t think there’s a significant difference of EV road tripping vs ICE now. At least me/my family are used to the cadence of EV road tripping, and the Kia charges fast enough and EA seems reliable enough to make it work out fine. 

But…:

·      The Tesla network is still better sited and has more chargers available.  Wherever we charged it seemed there was a Tesla site nearby that had a better location with better restaurants etc nearby, more chargers available, a canopy blocking sun/rain, etc. We get Tesla access next month. I’m still excited for that. 

·      Pricing of fast charging needs to change, else as is I racked up \~$100 more for kWh this trip than gas in an analogous hybrid/ICE roadtrip. I used my 1000 kWh free Electrify America credit this trip. And overall I save more by routine use vs that extra $100 on the occasional road trip. But this pricing, on top of EVs still being more expensive up front here than ICE/hybrid, will limit adoption. Not to mention that refueling gas is still definitely faster than charging batteries. For the uninitiated-to-EVs, if they road trip often, I still feel compelled to tell them to consider hybrid/PHEV, even as I’m personally all in on BEVs.

·      Kia’s route planning needs to improve. My ideal is still what I have in my Polestar 2 and its native Google maps. With that, I plug in the destination, it figures out my charging stops and preconditioning and gives me estimated battery % at destination so I can track how I’m doing. Here, the Kia route planning was plainly insufficient. I instead used ABRP and manually put the suggested charging stops into Google Maps and used CarPlay to navigate. I manually started battery preconditioning when I was 15-20 min from the destination. I can do this as I’m an EV geek. The median consumer won’t. With Volvo/Polestar’s setup the median consumer could acculturate fine; as with Tesla’s. Too bad the Model X is written off for us for varied reasons and the EX90 is still so buggy."

I need to drive to Philly and back in a couple weeks. Anyone else made this drive before in an EV? I'm especially looking for tips on the fastest / most reliable charging spots along the way. I made this drive once before a while ago and I made *all* the wrong decisions, wasted tons of time looking for chargers that work, and almost ran out of juice at one point. Super stressful.

How Reliable Are Chinese EVs?
I know that in the US, it will be an uphill battle for Chinese EVs to enter the US market, but based on users in Europe, Asia, LatAm, MENA, Sub Saharan Africa, and Oceania, how reliable are they compared to EVs from the US (Tesla, GM, Ford), Europe, Japan, South Korea, and Vietnam (Vinfast)? How reliable are they compared to ICE cars?

Also, are the EV ""fires"" overexaggerated? My cousin believes Chinese EVs catch fire (he watches China Insider and China Observer and stuff), they are sold for dirt cheap prices as a clearance tactic, and they are so unreliable. Just wanting input from users.

I tried to tell my cousin that China Insider et al are propaganda but he dismissed my corroborations as ""fake"" and thought China Insider is a factual news source.

Disclaimer: I don't have any brothers. The aforementioned cousin of mine was born in 1995. I (23M) was born in 2001, and have two sisters (one was born in 1990, the other was born in 2001). I am the only male child in my family. "

I don't want EVs to start coming in with NACS port natively. Other networks are getting more reliable, better speeds and even better amenities.
The NACS - mania that started with Ford getting supercharger access and then kept rolling until every brand, except for a few major luxury ones have committed to NACS.

Here's my dislike issues for NACS, specifically for NACS Tesla superchargers.

1. Not enough voltage. For EVs from Hyundai, Kia, GM high end vehicles, Lucid and even a few German luxury brands. High pack voltage EVs have to use a small onboard booster, this makes even the fastest charging EV a charging lemon at a supercharger.

2. Not enough current. EVs with very low pack voltage, similar to equinox, blazer, prologue need higher currents to charge faster at lower voltages. Superchargers suck at it. Ironically, a Chevy Equinox will charge faster at a 350kw station rated for 500 amps, than at a 150kw station, because of higher current ratings.

3. Tesla will solve the problem with V4 advocates. How long before all the superchargers that are either V3/V3.5 and open to non-Tesla EVs actually get upgraded to proper V4 - with the 4th Gen dispenser and 4th Gen cabinets, to support 1000V at 600A, as stated by Tesla Charging? We don't know. I say, not anytime before 2030.

4. Other Networks are slow to install NACS. This means that your EV capable of charging at high speeds can't charge at high speeds with your chargeport and the networks capable of charging at high speeds don't go into your chargeport. Ioniq5 2025 and Lucid gravity owners have to carry around charging adapters so that they can access networks that would otherwise have been capable of charging their cars without one, at the speeds their cars are designed for.

5. CCS is more capable than you know. There has been testing that shows that CCS can support up to 990kw charging speed, essentially megawatt charging. Future 2500s, 3500s and semi trucks can easily charge on an already established supply network for a charging port. NACS doesn't have that capability.

Let's show CCS some love, because it was tarnished by the bad charging networks, despite it being far more superior. "

Don’t Tase me Bro, but EA Stations are…Fine?
I’ve taken 5,000 miles of road trips in the southwestern US since I got my BMW iX last June, and have been mostly been utilizing the free 1K kWh of EA charging that was included.  Going from Arizona to Colorado, and later to Texas, I have not ever had to wait for an open plug, and have not experienced any significant issues that prevented charging.

There have been some annoying problems.  A few times I’ve had to switch between plugs due to slow charging.  I’ve faced a control panel that was dark, even though the plug was functional…but a month later I saw that it had been fixed.  Shoutout to PlugShare, which has helped me know what to watch out for.

I don’t question the experience of others, and certainly some regions of the country have more charger contention than I’ve seen.  I do believe, however, that much of the EA hate is based on their history which I acknowledge had less reliability, or individual frustrating experiences that are not indicative of their current overall quality.

What I’ve seen suggests that EA’s efforts to improve reliability are paying off.  Kudos to them."

Battery to put surplus solar kwh into, with CCS2 in and out
I'm in Australia, I just bought a Fronius Wattpilot for our new EV, we only have single phase so it's got a 7kw max output. It also has Eco mode which can put all the surplus PV generation from our 5kw roof array into the car when it's plugged in. The unfortunate thing is how often that surplus gets exported to grid for a pittance, because the car is used for commuting, it's not at home.  I can't justify the inverter upgrade and battery cost for a home battery but wonder if there's a reliable, not-too- expensive battery charger (above 5kwh) with CCS2 input and output? What I've found so far appears to be made for electric buses (and I think they charge from the wall outlet, which I can't as easily configure to only use surplus PV)"

Is there any 3rd party extended warranty for used ev?
I’m interested to pick up used ev. Ev is mostly reliable, however, if you get unlucky & get a problematic one, it may be costly to repair it out of warranty. I want to hedge that risk by getting a 3rd party extended warranty. Is there such coverage for used ev? Thanks. "

BMW & Audi EVs: are they as expensive to maintain after warranty ends?
I’ve always been told to lease a BMW or Audi because they’re too expensive to maintain after the warranty ends... sitting at the shop and so forth. But does that logic still hold for their EVs? Since electric vehicles are simpler with only about 20 moving parts compared to the thousands in traditional engines. Does that make their longer term reliability less of a concern?"

Canadian coming to Portugal and Spain
Hi all!

We’re looking to do a road trip from Lisbon to Madrid to Granada to Seville then back to Lisbon. 

Is it ok to do this with an EV or should we rent a gas car? 

1. Is it going to be much cheaper to do this with an EV?

2. Are there reliable chargers available along those highways between the cities?

Thank you!"

How are repair costs for an EV?
My dad really likes the Smart #1, but coming from an early 2000's gas car he converted to LPG, he is skeptical of the ev's device-ness.

How reliable are the general mechanics of the motor and electronics (other than the battery which we know will be fine), and how are repair costs in terms of transmission and motor? How much would a replacement cost? Will the display go kaput and make the car useless?

We haven't found any useful info on this (the car is pretty new), and the dealership (predictably) told us ""they will deal with everything, don't worry"" and couldn't give us any figures on cost.

Any info will be greatly appreciated! Thanks"

Programming tool Kia ev3
Hello,

I’m considering getting this car for work and have received a good offer. However, during my test drive, I found the warning sounds to be extremely disruptive. For example, I need to use GPS on my phone in a holder while working, but the “eye on road” warning goes off every time I glance at the GPS. Similarly, the lane assist feature is frustrating, especially since I frequently start and stop the car every 15 minutes during my job.

I understand that both features can be turned off in the settings, but they automatically reactivate after restarting the car. Is there any reliable Kia dealer with the right tools who can program these settings to remain permanently OFF? Or perhaps there is a tool available online similar to OBDeleven that I can buy. I would happily like to know 👍

Another thing I noticed during the test drive was that the auto HOLD feature didn’t engage every time I stopped; I had to hold the brake for a longer time. Additionally, the electric brake, which is supposed to regenerate energy by braking, barely slows the car down toward the end. The car automatically moves forward as soon as I release the brake. Is there a way to adjust this so the car always brakes to a complete stop as soon as I release the accelerator?

Thank you."

The State of EVs in 2025 - LIVE! | Talking Cars with Consumer Reports
I've long ago given up on CR with it comes to EVs. I honestly don't think they hate EVs, just no one on staff likes or tries to keep up with the industry. You would think they would hire someone that sort of kinda likes EVs. A lot of the issues with [the video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=657e0sQDDdo) is because of lack of knowledge. Of course, they picked the questions and the questions are where the problem is, and they basically validated the questions by not knowing why they were false questions.

The three participants all reported on what car they would buy:

* Jennifer - Wanted a PHEV Honda Ridgeline but since that does exist ICE.
* Alex - Would buy an ICE car or maybe a Hybrid.
* Jake - Just bought a car and it was a manual ICE car.
* Dave - Wasn't asked as he was running the chat questions live

Timestamps:

* [Opening comments on the State of EVs in 2025](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=47) \- 8.7% market share and not just Tesla now, a lot more hybrids, lots of delayed and canceled EVs and politics is going against them.
* [2012 Tesla Model S had to replace battery for $20k](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=231) \- Implied that all EVs have battery problems, maybe used batteries are the answer?
* [My Versa gets 40mpg, why do I need an EV](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=328) EVs are not for everyone, but a hybrid will be nicer than the ICE Verse.
* [F-150 Lightning in Wisconsin](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=409) \- You are brave to own an EV in that condition.  Do you even use your EV truck as a truck? Winter tire is going to reduce range and might not be livable.  EVs warm up much better than ICE cars.
* [Adapting to road trips with an EV](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=514) \- Alex reluctantly takes them because it's his job.  Agreed that Tesla is fine, but non-Tesla is not.
* [Trump is going to pull the plug on EVs](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=556) \-Jake points out that the auto industry needs stability.  Alex thinks BEVs are a question mark if they will make it.
* [Why are the Model 3/Y depreciating so fast](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=731) \- Alex said batteries will die, so no one wants them used. Jack thinks used car buyers can't charge, so not as attractive to them, and the tech is changing too quickly.  Points out the 2012 Model S didn't have Autopilot as an example and EVs with Chademo.
* [Asked Panelists EV or ICE for their car](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=921)
* [Will hydrogen make a comeback](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1024) \- Yes
* [Considering a Vinfast or Hybrid](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1271) \- Hybrid unless Vinfast is near free.
* [Will US get battery swap for EVs](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1344) \- No.
* [Federal Road Taxes](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1533) \- Need to pay for the road, and EVs are harder on the roads.
* [Where do EV batteries end up after the car is scraped](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1729) \- Didn't know, but probably recycling and repurposed for other uses.
* [Are EVs throw away since the battery only lasts 10 years](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1831) \- Not just EVs being thrown away, and EVs will stabilize once they quit changing so fast.
* [Will EVs get more reliable](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=1983) \- They already have, but they have to build them more basic without all the features.
* [Why are EV Radiators Hidden](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=2136) \- To look different and EVs don't have the same need for cooling.
* [Are EVs better for the environment](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=2224) \- Maybe, but it's very much an open question.
* [Should EVs be required to have heated headlights and taillights](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=2370) \- No, all cars with LEDs have this issue.
* [Top EV](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=2515)
   * Jennifer - Ioniq5 / BMW i5 / BMW iX
   * Jake - Ioniq5 N
   * Alex - Ioniq6
* [Will EVs get more Affordable](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=2687) \- Mostly No.  EVs dominate luxury and sports cars, and these classes are expensive.
* [Will Insurance Remain High for EVs](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=2934) \- They will remain high but shop around.
* [What car do you want to be an EV](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=3065)
   * Jennifer - Honda Ridgeline
   * Jake - Convertible Roadster Sports Car
   * Alex - PHEV pickup trucks
* [Regulating the Danger of EV Fires](https://youtu.be/657e0sQDDdo?t=3379) \- The risk is with the car, not the electrical connection. Get the cars out of the garage and away from the structure."

Tesla is the iPhone of EVs
Biggest reason people would buy one (in the US) in 2025+ is because they road trip a lot, was super easy charging and a good phone app, like tech, and want an inexpensive EV that ""just works."" There is nothing wrong with that. Most people would prefer that, most don't want to deal with the 20 apps needed to charge at half broken chargers on their road trips. Many people have families and want an easy road trip car they can charge that has TONS of storage (MY has amazing storage, front back and inside).

  
At this point the MY however:



\- has far fewer physical buttons than most want

  
\- No gauge cluster is a huge negative for many 



\- looks are meh



\- Range is not great vs competition, but not bad



\- people dont wanna give money to a Nazi



\- missing lots of features people would want in a pricier car



\- not the best at anything vs others EVs except charging reliability: charging speed, comfort, luxury features, etc etc is better in many, many EVs, albeit at a \*higher cost\*

  
Do you still think (with the MY refresh) the MY will continue to be the best seller for years to come? Hard to argue with the price and the benefits, and the refresh gets more luxury features and IMO it looks way better. It could be sold for $10k new and I personally would never have anything to do with Tesla because of Musk, but that's just me.

Accounts required for charging
I recently took my EV on a mini road trip and planned out stops for charging. I was incredibly annoyed to find that most charging stations required me to download an app and set up an account to charge. I finally found one that would let me just swipe my card and will solely use that brand moving forward.

Why do all of these charging stations require me to create an account to charge? It makes the charging experience so annoying and confirms the narrative that owning an EV is inconvenient. My friends who were driving with me said they’d never get an EV after watching me struggle to find a reliable charger that didn’t require 10 minutes of setup."

V2H charging not G or L
I cannot find a reliable accurate list for v2H charging.  Anyone have a list of cars that actual do this now?  Not in the future…but now. The small Chevy SUVs like the blazer and equinox seem to have been able but now can’t?

The AI list on google is clearly wrong.  😂. 

I contacted Rivian to see if they have an estimate and they basically said there is no hardware available to do it.  It didn’t sound like they are creating their own.

Does the reliability of an EV mirror the reliability of the company's ICE vehicles
I feel like with EVs, a company's reliability reputation with its ICE vehicles may not be correlated. For example, toyota is known for its reliabiltiy but its BZ4x is a flop. On the other hand, Nissan seems to be able to produce affordable and reliable EVs like the Leaf. I wouldn't touch a ICE Volkswagen, but I would consider a EV Volkswagen."

Are there any apps or site offering a visibility of prices of DC charging?
I mainly use plugshare and It's frustrating how much you have to dig to see prices for a station, and sometimes it's not there at all!

On my routes there are dozens of chargers I can choose from, with various levels of quality, reliability and price. 

It would be great if these apps, especially abrp, offered filtering based on price so you could ignore more expensive stations on a route.

If course one solution is to check the app of each charger for the actual price, but that's quite the hassle when driving and needing to make choices between options. 


Has anyone found viable solutions to This?

A new year conversation about SDV with Grok. Does this conversation challenges your own opinions on SDV and the future of automotive industry? 




**What aspect of the current technological shift towards BEVs and SDVs excites you the most, and what concerns you?**

(Me) SDV as “Software Defined vehicle” is definitely the most interesting component because it drives the shift toward  robotics of the vehicle.  

(Grok) That's a fascinating focus. The shift towards Software Defined Vehicles (SDVs) indeed signifies a profound change in automotive design and functionality, essentially turning vehicles into rolling computers. This:

- **Excites** because:
  - **Innovation in Robotics:** As you mentioned, this shift inherently involves robotics, which could revolutionize vehicle safety, autonomy, and functionality. 
  - **Continuous Improvement:** Unlike traditional vehicles where improvements are often hardware-based, SDVs can receive updates over-the-air, potentially offering new features or enhancing existing ones without physical modifications.
  - **Personalization:** Owners can tailor their driving and vehicle experience through software, much like customizing a smartphone.

- **Concerns** might include:
  - **Security:** With vehicles becoming more like computers, they're also more vulnerable to hacking or cyber-attacks, potentially compromising safety or privacy.
  - **Reliability:** Software bugs or failures could lead to safety issues, recalling vehicles virtually instead of physically, which presents new challenges for manufacturers and regulators.
  - **Dependency on Software Companies:** As cars rely more on software giants for updates, there might be concerns over control, data ownership, and even the longevity of vehicle functionality if support is discontinued.

Do these resonate with your thoughts, or are there other aspects you find compelling or worrying?

(Me) Well, there are the “production efficiency” aspects that are really big in terms of impacts on the automotive industry.  For instance, cables are very hard to install and automate. SDV has forced a complete redefine of cabling for power and data as THE key architectural component of the HW, allowing for the development of novel cabling solutions that can be automated on the assembly line (and new protocol/standards like 48 V service power bus and Ethernet )


(Grok) That's an excellent point about production efficiency. The transition to SDVs indeed has significant implications for manufacturing:

- **Cabling Redesign:** Traditional vehicles might have kilometers of wiring, which is not only labor-intensive but also prone to errors. SDVs push for streamlined cabling architectures:

  - **Reduced Complexity:** By integrating more functions into software, the physical wiring can be significantly reduced, potentially leading to lighter vehicles with fewer points of failure.
  
  - **Automation in Assembly:** As you noted, with simpler and standardized cabling (like Ethernet for data and a 48V power bus), assembly line automation becomes more feasible, reducing costs and improving quality control.

- **New Standards and Protocols:** 
  - **48V Service Power Bus:** This introduces a higher voltage system for accessories, potentially simplifying power distribution and increasing efficiency.
  - **Ethernet:** Moving from CAN bus to Ethernet allows for higher data throughput, which is crucial for the data-intensive nature of modern vehicles, particularly for autonomous driving and advanced infotainment systems.

These changes not only affect how vehicles are made but also how they can evolve post-production, offering scalability and adaptability that traditional manufacturing couldn't dream of. It's a paradigm shift that could make the automotive industry more agile and responsive to technological advancements and consumer needs. 

Do you see other areas where this shift in production efficiency could have broader impacts, or are there potential drawbacks to these new approaches?

(Me) The redesign of the car architecture implies that the whole assembly line concept may be in for a paradigm change. 

This has big implications because old assembly lines may quickly lose their CAPEX/collateral value and with them the whole access to credit for companies that used these capital investments as financial backing. 

Also the impact on training and workforce on the line should not be forgotten. 

(Grok) Your insights highlight significant implications of the shift towards SDV architecture, particularly in:

- **Assembly Line Redesign:** 
  - **Paradigm Shift:** The move to SDVs might necessitate moving away from traditional assembly line models to something more modular or flexible, where components can be easily updated or changed without major overhauls. This could mean investing in new types of manufacturing technology, like more advanced robotics or AI-driven assembly processes.

- **Financial Implications:**
  - **Depreciation of Capital Assets:** As you've pointed out, the existing infrastructure, including assembly lines, could quickly depreciate, potentially becoming obsolete. This affects not only the operational aspects but also the financial stability of companies that have leveraged these assets for credit. 
  - **Access to Credit:** With devalued capital assets, companies might face challenges in securing loans or investments for transitioning to new manufacturing processes, impacting growth or even survival.

- **Workforce and Training:**
  - **Skill Shift:** The workforce will need to adapt from assembling complex wiring harnesses to dealing with more software-oriented tasks or managing highly automated systems. This means a shift towards skills in software, data handling, and robotics maintenance rather than traditional mechanical assembly. 
  - **Training Programs:** There will be a need for extensive retraining or upskilling of the current workforce. This can be both an opportunity for workers to advance in new areas of expertise and a challenge for companies to ensure they have the skilled labor required for modern production lines.

These changes could lead to a broader industry transformation, where only those manufacturers able to pivot quickly to new production paradigms might thrive. There's also an opportunity here for innovation in workforce development and in creating more sustainable and efficient manufacturing processes. 

How do you think companies should manage this transition to mitigate risks while capitalizing on the opportunities presented by SDVs?

(Me) I wish I had a definitive answer, but I can try. First they (companies) should realize that the shift toward SDV is no longer a possibility but an inevitable event. 

Also they need to understand their financial fragility, with older companies with a lot of factories and capital investments at higher risk.

The impeding credit crunch on them will force to use more and more free cash flow to renovate factories and workforce.

At about 1.5 billions USD per an average factory renovation cost, it is clear that not all the legacy factories can be retooled, actually no more than 1/3.

This means a lot of hard choices, with factories closures and concentration in fewer area, with vast economic impacts in the communities that will lost the abandoned plants.

One possible remedy to these community impacts would be to use the spaces and the reusable tools to spin off new enterprises, like incubators using machinist, welders and other skilled labor.

The sooner the communities get involved the better.

From the companies standpoint, the sooner they realize that they cannot keep the same production levels during restructuring the more money they will have to finance their retooling and help the communities they will abandon. 

Bottom line, timing is of the essence, for both the communities and the companies. The first one ti start the transitions will have higher probability of success. Who will drag and try to preserve old paradigms will probably end up implementing the changes in a much harsher economical environment.

No time for half baked measures

(Grok) Your analysis offers a stark but insightful view into the challenges and strategic pathways for automotive manufacturers transitioning to SDV production. Here's how this might play out based on your points:

- **Acknowledging Inevitability:** Recognizing that SDVs are not just a trend but a fundamental shift in vehicle production is crucial. Companies need to integrate this into their long-term strategy, not just their product lineup.

- **Financial Vulnerability:** Legacy automakers with heavy investment in traditional manufacturing setups are indeed at higher risk. The capital tied up in these facilities can become a financial burden rather than an asset if not managed wisely during this transition.

- **Cash Flow Management:** Diverting free cash flow towards factory renovation and workforce retraining is essential, but as you've noted, the scale of investment required (around $1.5 billion per factory) means tough choices. 

- **Selective Retooling:** Given the financial implications, companies might only revamp a fraction of their facilities. This necessitates:
  - **Strategic Closures:** Deciding which plants to close, potentially leading to job losses and economic downturns in those communities. 
  - **Geographical Consolidation:** Focusing on fewer, more strategically located factories to leverage economies of scale and modern logistics.

- **Community Impact Mitigation:** 
  - **Repurposing Infrastructure:** Using closed factories as incubators for new businesses could help retain skilled labor and stimulate local economies. This would involve converting these spaces into technology hubs, manufacturing for other industries, or even educational centers for new skills.
  - **Community Involvement:** Early engagement with local governments and communities can lead to more sustainable economic transitions, perhaps through retraining programs or new industry initiatives.

- **Operational Realism:** Companies must accept that maintaining current production levels during restructuring is unrealistic. They should plan for temporary reductions in output to finance the transition, which requires foresight in customer expectations management and supply chain adjustments.

- **Timing and Agility:** The urgency to act quickly cannot be overstated. Those who adapt swiftly will likely secure a better position in the new market landscape, while those who delay might face not only higher costs but also a tougher economic environment with less room for maneuver.

In summary, the transition to SDVs demands a holistic approach, combining foresight, financial acumen, community involvement, and a willingness to let go of old paradigms for new opportunities. The challenge is monumental but so are the potential rewards for those who navigate it successfully."

The moment when we can get reliable ICE-to-EV swaps that aren't the price of a new car and have acceptable range and power is when EVs will have properly taken over.
So, this is a bit of a vent coming from some arguments I've had with people. Some context. 

i drive 2 older vehicles. a 96 vette and a 04 grand cherokee. and i genuinely have no desire to get a new car.  

i despise screens, i don't want my car updating over wifi, and i hate minimalistic interiors. 

I'm 26 years old, and I'm in California that is happily blue. I'm not some older guy yelling at clouds 

Despite this, I'm not really in love with gas. The noise is fun, but it's whatever. its not a deal breaker.  
  
Wrenching can be fun, but there's no getting around. Its messy, a pain in the ass at times, and new parts, more commonly, are just kind of crap. 

, if we can get to a spot in time, where we can get 250mi of range out of the size of a 20 gallon fuel tank, same power as factory (realistically mounted to or with some housing where the transmission is) and not have it cost as much as a collage tuition, like 10k at maximum

that, 's when i feel EVs will have officially replaced gas. 

all i want is to be able to keep what I'm driving on the road. That's what i want. i couldn't give much of a shit what powers it. I like what I drive, and that's what I want to keep driving. "

Counting EVs on the highway for fun (it's not)
Don't read this (or too much **into** this) unless you are as bored as I was. Every conclusion here is a small sample of observable stuff during a trip, so take it with a pinch of road salt.

**TLDR** : The Equinox EV is selling more than I thought, and Nissan EVs apparently can't go on the highway (joke, of course). Read more for my hot takes that will undoubtedly change your life.

I spent too much time doing this for its actual relevance. I'm off work and I do what I please with my own time, thank you very much

The other day I was a passenger on a pretty slow day on the highway with a couple of hours to go. Decided to count every visually-obvious BEV either oncoming or passing us (we were going 100 kph in our Bolt EV, so we didn't really pass anyone ourselves except some vans and the occasional slow semi). Driving on the A20 transcanadian highway in Québec, in cold temp (about -10 Celsius, so I expected to see less of short-ranged EVs). I thought I'd see something interesting during our 2 hours trip, and that it would be a fun (ok, not *very* fun, but I wasn't driving), objective way of figuring out popular brands and models... with some caveats :

* I probably did not recognize or spot every model, especially models that have ICE counterpart (ie : Soul and Kona)
* At some point we were in a traffic jam and some occurences might have been either missed or misindentified because of cars partially hidden.
* I did not include PHEV even if some are easy to recognize (ie : the Prius), because that would be unfair to other PHEVs that are very similar to ICE models
* I get distracted, sometimes. Let's assume it affected every model equally and move on.

Here's the list of EVs I spotted, by brand in alphabetical order (If I forgot a brand or model, it's because I didn't see it anyway) :

**BMW** : 2 total

* 2 unknown SUVs (I don't know their models but they were definitely EVs)

**Cadillac** : z e r o

* None

**Chevrolet (and Hummer)** : 40 total (#1)

* 21 (!) Equinox EV
* 7 Bolt EV (including ours)
* 2 Bolt EUV
* 6 Blazer EV
* 2 Silverado EV
* 1 Spark EV (!)
* 1 Hummer EV

**Ford** : 8 total

* 7 Mach-Es
* 1 F-150 Lightning

**Hyundai** : 28 total (#3)

* 16 Ioniq 5
* 2 Ioniq 6
* 7 Kona EV (+ maybe some that I couldn't verify if I had seen the EV or ICE)
* 3 original Ioniq

**Kia** : 18 total (#4)

* 13 EV 6
* 2 EV 9
* 3 Soul EV (very hard to distinguish from the ICE model so I probably missed a few)

**Lucid** : z e r o

* None spotted (and they are very rare in Québec overall. I think I've only seen one, ever)

**Nissan :** z e r o

* None (even though they are very recognizable, so I don't think I missed any)!

**Polestar :** 3 total

* 3 Polestar 2 (one looked different, but I don't know their models well)

**Porsche** : 1 total

* 1 Macan (fairly sure)

**Rivian :** 1 total

* 1 R1T

**Subaru** : 3 total

* 3 Solterras

**Tesla** : 31 total (#2)

* 15 model Y
* 14 Model 3 (some might have been model S, we were in traffic so it wasn't clear)
* 2 model S

**Toyota** : 2 total

* 2 BZ4X

**Volkswagen** : 14 total (#5)

* 14 ID.4

**Volvo** : 3 total

* 2 SUV (no idea which)
* 1 C40 (crossover, so easier to spot)

My hot takes :

* The Equinox was by far the most frequently seen EV with 21 occurrences (runner-up is the Ioniq 5 with 16 spotted, followed by the models Y and 3 respectively), which is kinda surprising for a 2024 model only (most model 3 were the older version, with only a handful being the updated design). As for the Ioniq 5 and model Y, we could expect most were from previous years as well. AFAIK the cheaper model (1LT) isn't even for sale in Québec yet, so I guess it's going to be popular when it does. Didn't expect Chevy to be the total leader overall in spotted EVs either, but it's really the Equinox carrying the team here. Mad respect for that single Spark EV driver going places (but not too far).
* Teslas are less frequent than I would have thought. The Supercharger advantage is less powerful in Québec since we have the Circuit Électrique (which is a public network that is quite reliable and affordable), so that might be why they possibly represent a smaller part of the EV pie in Québec.
* The Ioniq 5 is more frequent than I would have expected, since it's on the more expensive side. Not complaining, though, that car is beautiful imho. A similar observation for the ID.4, but this time because I had heard bad comments about it. Must be more popular than I thought initially (or maybe the people I know that were disappointed with it just didn't like/understand EVs at all)
* I really thought the Ioniq 6 was more popular. I guess it's not.
* I'm surprised to have seen exactly zero Nissan EVs, either Leaf or Ariya. Could it be linked to the cold weather? I've heard they perform poorly in the cold, but haven't looked into it much further than that.
* Expected more EV pick-ups, with their longer range and all. Only 3 during the whole trip, and only around cities and towns. Huh.

Got my heart set on a Model Y, but my family keeps talking about how bad they are.
Context: Am in the U.S.

I've been looking at used Model Y's for a while now, and I've decided I’m gonna get one, particularly one with FSD due to vision issues that impair my ability to drive. (I can still see well enough to drive manually if need be, it’s just the fact that I’m legally (half) blind and have bad peripheral vision makes it difficult, especially in bad weather or at night.)

(Just use public transit or bike! I hear you say. No. I can’t ride a bike due to medical conditions and public transport here in the US where I live is frankly shit. A car is my only way of getting around quickly.)

(Keep in mind: I haven’t actually received or insured the vehicle yet, I’m in the process of going through financials at this point, and I hope to get one sometime within the coming months.)

However, my family (more specifically my father) doesn't like them at all. 

He always brings up ""horror stories"" of Tesla's dying and breaking down all the time, poor reliability, cars needing expensive repairs, slow charging times/not being able to charge anywhere, bad build quality, etc.

I know at least some of it is inaccurate, but him saying all these bad things all the time is putting me on the fence. I'm just curious on how many of his statements hold up, if at all.

EDIT: Home charging is set up already for those wondering, due to my mother owning a Rivian. I’ll most likely use that charger with the included adapter.

EDIT 2: My mother and I are running it (the Tesla) through her insurance, alongside payment and delivery. I’m responsible for regular upkeep and any modifications.

EDIT 3: I’m the main owner, but family is allowed to use it if need be (I’m staying with them for the time being)"

EA Gen 4 hardware failing in the wild
Electrify America made lots of reliability promises about the Gen 4 hardware and now that it has been in the ground for a while, they seem to be perpetually broken like the old ABB Terra HP and BTC Power HPC hardware that came before it. I am curious what you all are seeing in the wild.

I have talked to more than one EA employee who has said the hardware just cannot handle the constant use 24x7x365. It's wild to me that they did not spec a sufficient duty cycle when designing the Gen 4 hardware, considering all the history with EA hardware reliability problems."

Why have the DC fast charge stations in the US not managed by Tesla taken so long to improve?
Industry Discussion:

Hi all,

I realize that the non-Tesla-managed fast charge stations are improving (such as indicated in the study at the link below) but even now they remain (on average) sub-par, overall.

With regard to rule three of this subreddit (no charger drama) I am also not writing with any particular negative personal experiences.  My point here is general industry discussion based on observations over the last few years and decades.  

I personally think it is in the nature of the matter that DC Fast Charge stations, whose reliability is often as critical for uninterrupted travel as that of gas stations (if not more essential given their relative scarcity in some areas) ... I think that they must achieve a very high number of nines of reliability in order to be evaluated as satisfactory.  The achieved reliability of some non-Tesla-managed DCFC over the last 10 years or so seems to be one or two orders of magnitude worse than what is needed.

So, what has been the problem, or multiple problems?  I'm going to put forth a few tentative possible answers, some of which I subscribe to (to one degree or another) and some of which I do not.  Please anyone who wants suggest additional and/or better ideas:

- It seems likely that some of the networks are or have been, to some degree or in some way, incompetently managed.
- the multiplicity of vehicle manufacturers might lead to significant difficulty making the charging experience reliable and fast across all user experiences.  (As opposed to Tesla which, similar to Apple, had only one brand it needed to serve, and it controlled all aspects of that ecosystem including the connection design, the charging, the stations, the vehicles, etc.)
- The difficulty of getting utilities to play ball and fully provide the levels and types of power to the site that are needed.
- The lack of understanding of how many connectors are needed at a site in order to ensure that individual drivers can get a reliable and quick charge, overcoming the occasional individual port outage or surge in number of drivers seeking charge.
- weather issues (eg: too cold in some cases?)
- brain drain on being able to find sufficient service personnel?
- lack of sufficient numbers of EVs, and related cash flow, for many years.  (this is one factor that gets a vote from me).  In turn, this factor interacts with others.  For example, it's hard to justify a site having 10 connectors at 100 kW each when the number of drivers is not yet very high, and when the utility may still be demanding Demand charges.
- Demand Charges by utilities - is that still a strong headwind for installing the stations.
- Lack of appropriate widespread 3 phase power infrastructure?
- slow progress on allowing DCFC operators to bill by kWh?
- some hardware manufacturers better than others.
- I realize this will be dismissed by some as reducing the credibility of my point of view on this, but I think the question needs to be asked as to whether it's possible that anyone might have influenced some charging industry participants to provide worse customer experiences.  (For one example: could an oil industry organization find a way to harm the billing experiences of some EV drivers trying to charge.)  I don't think the answer is that this has happened, but I do think we should keep in mind that it's not outside the realm of possibility.
- slow-to-market CCS arrival (at first it was just CHAdeMO as an alternative to Tesla).

etc.

So, I'll be curious to see what others think as to which factor(s) have been the most important.

Does Equinox EV have Lidar/Radar
Hey everyone, 

First off, I'm new to posting on this sub. I read the rules but not 100% sure where to flair this. Not exactly seeking buying advice but just some information without Tesla bias.

I'm going on the market for an EV soon and been trying to decide between the Tesla or an Equinox EV. A lot of factors are relatively favouring Tesla right now but I'm trying to really fight it and give Elon less money, if I can.

Tesla vision has me freaked out a bit - it's cost cut to the point of bad autopilot it seems. The latest model does seem to have improved cameras and stuff but not sure if that translates to reliability in any way.

It got me wondering if either the 2024/25 equinox EV use more than just cameras. They say Lidar maps, but it doesn't seem to have any Lidar (undesirably that's crazy expensive), but all my digging only shows up other ""sensors"". Maybe it's radar, or maybe Ultrasound, or maybe it's just blind spot sensors or something.

Wouls anyone out here have info on whether this car's ADAS actually has any official engineering reason to be considered a safer system than Tesla's AP?


Edit: Please let's not compare FSD folks. I'm not interested in it.

Edit2: a lot of the confusion here seems to be that no one has clear info on why Tesla vision might be superior or inferior. For reference, purely  computer vision based systems, while impressive, have strong limitations in many areas like robotics, etc. vision over other systems is a cost-cut / cost-effective decision for an ADAS system, and using other sensors will build more robust ADAS - these are a facts. That said, it will help if we focus the conversation around whether a purely vision based systems is robust enough for most use-cases. That seems debatable: https://youtu.be/mPUGh0qAqWA?si=4kXf30nGe8yBSohm"

Is there a reliable place to charge Ford Mach-E at el Centro, Arizona? No tesla adapter yet
I have a 2024 Ford Mach-E (basic model, lower range) and I’m thinking on driving to Phoenix, Arizona this week from San Diego, CA

A better route planner tells me to stop in Electrify America at El Centro but Plugshare shows a 4.8 rating (out of 10) there. Looks like multiple issues.

I do not see many working options with decent reviews/rating to use in El Centro. 

Has anyone done that drive? With a non-Tesla EV? I do not have any adapter yet. I’m waiting for Ford to ship me the one for supercharger and I ordered the one for level 2 charger but it has not arrive

Should I reconsider the roadtrip? We have an ICE car bur we want to try EV (first EV roadtrip). Should I buy the adapter for Tesla supercharger? It might arrive on time"

For me, in descending order:

1. Mercedes CLA (MMA) EV (800V, heat pump, L2++ ADAS, RWD platform for the EV, 2-speed gear box, LFP or NMC, possible 4MATIC+ on the AMG version)

2. VW Golf/ next ID3 (Software JV with Rivian but not out until 2027; centralized control could mean easy OTA updates and more reliable VAG BEVs down the road)

3. Porsche 718 EV (can't afford one but I'm sure it will be a wonderful no compromise EV; likely with AWD offering which the current ICEV doesn't have)"

Why are Tesla charging stations so much better?
Why don't non-Tesla EV charge stations make copies of superchargers with CCS instead of NACS? Ya, I know  patents, but there's ways around that. Why are Tesla so much better than evGo or chargepoint or whatever?

When Elon started, he said his goal was to make EV's a viable option (which he actually succeeded at), and if that were true it seems like he would have shared or at least licensed the supercharger design for use by other manufacturers.  I think that if EvGo et al had the efficiency and reliability of superchargers we would be a lot further along EV adoption than we are."

Thoughts about EV's after 1+ year of ownership
I bought a 2023 VW ID4 Pro S in October 2023, and recently took it on a road trip between the Bay Area and Portland, OR. I was going to write a post about that experience, but thought it would be more helpful to share other thoughts about EV ownership as well. This post is intended to help people who are considering buying (or just got) an EV for the first time.

 

**1. There are 3 types of chargers:**

* Level 1 plugs into a standard home outlet, and adds \~4 miles per hour of charging
* Level 2 is the ‘fast’ home charger – needs to be professionally installed because it uses a high voltage outlet. Costs vary but anticipate $1-2k for the charger + installation
* Level 3 chargers are available at charging stations only. These are much faster, and mostly used for road trips. They can charge most EVs to 80% in <30 minutes. Tesla’s supercharger network is by far the dominant charging network in the US. Other non-telsa networks include Electrify America, EV Go, and Chargepoint.

**2. Most people need to have an option to charge at home, but you don't necessarily need a professionally installed charger.**  A level 1 charger that plugs into a normal home outlet can add \~40-50 miles overnight if you plug it in when you get home and unplug when you leave the next morning. Even if your commute is longer than that, if you can plug in longer on the weekends, you can likely get by without any need for public charging. If you have a commute longer than 40 miles a day, and you can’t charge longer on the weekends, maybe you will have to charge every 2-3 weeks at the public charger. *A level 2 charger is awesome to have if you have the money and ability (i.e. not renting), but not necessary for owning an EV.*

**3. If you cannot charge the car at home in any way**, and you are relying only on public charging stations, you need to figure out how often you will need to charge the car. Anything more than charging every 2 weeks will be a headache in my opinion. The majority of EVs available now have range between 250-300 miles. You will be using 70% of that capacity in most cases because you will charge when you get to \~10%, and generally only charge to 80%. This means your typical range between charges is 175-210 miles. If you commute <20 miles a day, it’s probably fine to have no home-charging option and use the public charger every 2 weeks or so.

4. **Road trips <4 hrs.** This distance is not a problem for EVs. You can charge the car to 100% before departing, and generally make the trip without stopping, or maybe one stop. It doesn’t add that much inconvenience to the trip. Most road trips are going to be in this range, so an EV is again fine for most people.

5. **Road trips >4 hrs.** This is what most people are concerned about when switching from gas to EV. As I said previously, you generally are operating on about 70% of your battery capacity, since you are charging when you get to 10% and stopping charging at 80%. So, on a road trip, you have to stop about every 150-200 miles to charge. My Kia Niro hybrid gets twice this range on a full tank of gas (400 miles), there are many more gas stations to stop at, and it takes 5 minutes to fill up the tank. An EV will typically take 20-30 minutes to charge, and you will be stopping more often due to the lesser range. You also have to plan your route and stops more carefully, since there are less EV charging stations than there are gas stations. You also may have to deal with waiting to charge, which is never really an issue with gas stations. I think it’s a fair estimate to add 30 minutes to every 3 hrs of driving time that the same trip would take in a gas car. So if it’s typically a 10 hr drive in a gas car, it will be 11.5-12 hrs in an EV. This may or may not be an issue for you depending on how often you are driving >4 hrs, and how much it bothers you to take a little longer for the trip.

**6. Which car to get.** The majority of EV’s today have range 250-300 miles, and charge at similar speeds (100-150 kW) on public chargers. In general, the smaller EVs will be a better bang for your buck. This is because they are more efficient (expressed as miles/kwh, equivalent to mpg for gas cars), so they can get similar range with a smaller battery, which is the most expensive part of an EV currently. Examples include Hyundai Ioniq 5/6, Kia EV6, Tesla Model 3. This will likely change some going forward as batteries become cheaper. However, the majority of EV’s available in the US are small SUV/crossover type. These are all pretty similar cars. You can search many reddit threads to find positives and negatives of individual cars. We picked the ID4 because the interior is nice, drives comfortably, looks like a normal car (not spacey/futuristic), and was a good price. The downsides people talk about are software, which hasn’t been an issue for us, and the capacitive buttons, which are annoying. There is a recall out to fix the door handles, but seems like a rare problem, and hasn’t been an issue for us.

**7. Tesla** is the dominant EV in the US primarily due to their head start as a result of all other manufacturers being scared to make EVs until they saw it could work. Currently, the main advantage tesla has in my mind is the supercharger network. That primarily makes a difference for road trips >4 hrs for reasons listed above – more charging stations, more chargers at each station, and generally faster and more reliable chargers. However, many of the other EVs are getting access to the supercharger network, so this will be less of a differentiating factor going forward. If you are interested in an EV, just google that car + tesla supercharger access to check on the current and future availability of this option. Some people will argue that Tesla’s software is superior. Technically this is true, but practically, I don’t see much value in most of the features. If you are into software and controlling every aspect of the car from a large tablet, then this will be a positive for you. The other controversial Tesla feature is “full-self driving”. I personally don’t feel comfortable letting the car drive itself until it’s 100% proven safe, which I don’t feel the Tesla system is currently. So in my hands, I would use it equivalent to other highway driving assist that other EV’s have  - smart cruise control with lane keeping. Again, this is a feature that may or may not matter to you. The downsides of tesla in my mind are the interior (“minimal” is just cheap looking; and I like buttons/stalks rather than everything on a screen), the loud road noise, bumpy ride, and poor quality control for manufacturing. The CEO is another factor for me, but wouldn’t be the deciding one if there weren’t the other issues I listed.

 

Overall, I think an EV will work for most people. It will be more of a headache if you have a daily commute >40 miles and cannot charge at home at all (even with a regular outlet), or take frequent road trips >4 hrs. Tesla is currently the dominant EV due to its head start and supercharger network, but advantage will continue to fade as OEMs offer more competitive options."

Is car industry going to evolve same as watchmaking industry?

Back in the 70s when quartz watches appeared  it was thought that mechanical watches are dead. Quartz ones were more reliable, 100x more accurate and cheaper to produce. Mechanical watches lost huge share of Market and we thought that mechanical ones were part of history.

But, marketing and crafting strategy for mechanical watches changed and they saw resurgence during 90s and currently they hold hugest share of market. Watchmakers decided to sell mechanical watches as Luxury items, finely crafted with hundreds tiny mechanical components giving them a “Soul”. Primary function of the watch is not showing time anymore but indicator of Wealth and Fine taste which doesn’t come with “boring” electric watches.


Now, we are seeing something similar with Electric Vehicles. Tesla family SUVs are beating super cars like Ferrari, Lambo in drag races. Instant torque is unmatchable. EVs are cheaper to build and maintain with much less moving parts and fine details required for internal combustion engines and they consume much less energy per mille. It is just matter of time when we get batteries with sub5 mins charging time which will remove last advantageous point of ICEs. 

Can we draw parallel here!? Can we see ICE cars as a luxury commodity in the future same as mechanical watches. Primary function of these cars wont be going from A to B but showing wealth and fine taste? 
Will ICE cars reveal internals just like watch makers are doing to show fine craftsmanship and “soul”? 
In the end, Where do you see car industry in 20+ years?"

Tips for a weekend trip with a 2023 Polestar 2 rental? (figuring out charging stations)
I decided to visit some friends while visiting family in Texas. Since I flew there, I rented a car, getting an EV (the Polestar), as it was the best deal, thinking I wouldn't be driving more than 150 miles total. My friends decided they want to go camping at the beach this weekend, which would be about a 280 mile roundtrip, meaning I would probably have to charge twice - once on the way down, then again back north. I'm trying to do the necessary logistical research.

It seems like the most reliable charging stations would be Tesla, based on speed and location. I downloaded the Tesla app because I read that you need it to pay for the charging and it can tell you which locations have hookups for non-Teslas (and just letting you know in general where the charging stations are). I have a Samsung Galaxy S9, no problems with the phone, but the app is glitchy on my end. Pressing the find my location button doesn't always work, it won't let me press the button that says to add my vehicle, the list of chargers in a location are not sorted by distance (even though it supposedly says they are), and the list of stations doesn't seem to match up with what Google Maps is telling me. Any suggestions specific to figuring out the Tesla stuff?

And I see a lot of ""Destination Chargers"". What's the protocol/etiquette for using those? Are they open to the public, or merely for the destination customers (like if are a paying guest at the motel)? However, it looks like most/all are slow chargers, but if my need to charge is dire...

A Blink charging station a little north of my friends has two good reviews. One near my destination has one single bad review. Both are supposedly fast chargers (the bad review claimed that his car was being charged slow at 36 kw). Those familiar with Blink - are they pretty reliable or not?

The only other major thing I know about charging stations is watching some CNBC videos about EVs on YouTube. In one, the person went to different charging stations (in California, I think) and documented the ones that were under maintenance, not working, etc. (Spoiler alert: it was bad.) So any advice about successfully doing a beach trip in my rental EV would be appreciated. Worst case scenario, probably decide beforehand to cram into their gas car(s)."

mechanics and upkeep after purchase
So we took our ICE vehicle into for servicing and to get the snow tires put on. Its a 2014 Subaru Forester. I was a lemon, and we put a new engine into it when it was 3-4 years old. It has lots of mileage (about 600 k km) due to my work. It is reaching the end of the life we have for it. We also have a Prius Prime PHEV which we both love. 

So to replace the Subaru, we are starting to shop for a full EV. This new vehicle might be our last new vehicle ever, with luck as we are older and I am retired, and spouse works part time from home. But for various reasons, we still need two vehicles. We are thinking of a spring purchase, so have time to do lots of research and test driving. 

My spouse mentioned to our mechanic today that we are looking, and have test driven a couple of the Hyundai's (Ioniq 5 and 6) and the mechanic went off about all the recalls and problems. I am not seeing a lot of issues when I do a search in this sub, and both are highly rated by CR, Edmunds, Car and Driver etc. We love our mechanic and have been with the same folks for 40 years, they are honest, reliable and do excellent work, at a fair price. 

Is it partly that mechanics see their business leaving with the arrival of EVs and are negative in general? 

Are there many service providers for EVs outside of dealerships yet? What servicing will a full EV need? When I take my Prius in, its all about the ICE for servicing, except when I had an issue with the 12 Volt battery, which was covered under warranty.

Advice from someone who bought an EV planning on only public charging.
Don’t do it to yourself it’s not worth it. I regret this decision daily. At first I lived in a small town and I thought well maybe the charging network just hasn’t reached out here yet. Now I live in a big city and there’s still barely any good options to charge reliably. Unless your apartment complex offers a good charging option just don’t do it.

 It’s not worth the hassle. I’m constantly waiting in a line just to charge, then I wait while I charge, so for me charging at a fast charger ends up being like a 2 hour affair I have to plan for at least two times a week. This brings up the next set of advice if you’re still dead set on public charging opt for the long range version of whatever EV you want to buy so you charge less often.

TLDR: Don’t buy a EV if you plan on public charging only."

Went to CarMax to buy an ICE for our second car, drove off in a Tesla M3. All ICEs seemed from a different era. What am I missing?
My wife and I own a Model S for years, and recently we decided to buy a second car (used). We were thinking ICE because (a) it's a bit cheaper, (b) we can use it for longer trips without the charging stops, (c) later if our oldest goes to a college without EV charging support, he can take the ICE car with him.

We test drove a few, all nice ICEs (budget: $20K-$30K). CarMax also had a 2021 Tesla M3 for just shy of $30K that we thought to also try. As soon as we set out to drive, it became obvious to my wife, my kid, and myself that the technology in the Tesla was overwhelmingly superior to all ICEs we tried. It was as through some sci-fi thing a car from the future was sneaked onto the lot that we could try.

Yet there's a lot of anti-Tesla and anti-EV sentiment going around. Including of course many reddit forums. Even the young CarMax salesman took the opportunity to recommend a Mazda over the Tesla because ""first off I don't like electric cars, I wouldn't drive one... then, Japanese cars are very reliable and get you good mileage"". I told him I appreciate the thought but we'll get the Tesla nevertheless. As he was going through the steps of showing me what CarMax extended warranty (which had zero customization for EVs) can offer me, I pointed out that an EV doesn't even have most of the covered parts and subsystems. The irony was lost on him.

I don't think of myself as a blinded fanboi but maybe I am. What am I missing?"

Does NACS vs CCS-to-NACS matter as you shop?
I haven’t made the switch to an EV yet, but I’m planning to in the future. From what I’ve seen, Tesla’s charging network seems to be more reliable than most CCS networks. But now that Tesla’s network is opening up to other companies, does the charging port really matter as you find your car?

If you’re considering buying an EV9, Equinox EV, or any other car with a CCS port *that can use Tesla’s network*, does the port make a difference? Would you still limit yourself to cars that only support NACS charging, or would you be okay with a car that doesn’t have access to Tesla’s charging network?"

Road trips seem a lot less stressful in ICE vs my EV6
Before I get buried in downvotes and accusations of being an EV hater, I just want to say that I do really love my Kia EV6 for local driving.  The ride quality is great and the handling characteristics of EVs make it extremely enjoyable to drive around compared to ICE vehicles.  I also am very happy with it for relatively short road trips where I can charge at my destination and where I'll only need to stop once on the way, since planning alternative charging stops in that scenario is not too difficult.  This is my US-specific opinion based on living and travelling in the Southeast and Mid-Atlantic US, so things may be better or worse in other countries or areas.

That said, I just did a 1300 mile (roundtrip) road trip and I have to say I'm glad that I chose to take my ICE vehicle (Subaru Legacy) instead of my EV6.  In retrospect, the trip would have been so much more stressful in my EV6 especially with the tight schedule I had.  There are three main things that I think would have made my EV6 a more stressful choice:

**1) Lack of reliable 175kW+ charger availability.**

Relative to most other EVs, the EV6 and other eGMP vehicles are capable of faster charging, and this was a huge part of the reason I got this car.  However, only a fraction of deployed DCFC stalls can actually take full advantage of this.  My EV6 can hold 230kW+ speeds for a huge chunk of the charging curve.  After perusing PlugShare, I discovered that the only places on my route that consistently had any 175kW+ chargers were the Electrify America, Pilot/Flying J, Circle K, and (weirdly) Ford dealerships.  Most of the other ""fast"" chargers were 125kW or below, often 62.5kW or 50kW.  When I'm doing a long drive in one day, I really don't like stopping for longer than it takes me to use the bathroom and grab a snack - 10-15 minutes at most.  I don't want to be stuck at a slow ""fast"" charger for longer than I need to be.  Virtually every gas station offers both 87 and 91-93 Octane gas, so I believe that every DCFC should offer at least one actually fast charger.

This won't be fixed by the Tesla network opening either, because superchargers can't do 800V which means they provide comparatively slow charging speeds to 800V eGMP vehicles.  V4 superchargers capable of 800V+ are currently vaporware since zero of them have been deployed as of today.  Having to spot-check the PlugShare reviews for each DCFC site before stopping there to avoid ending up at a ""dud"" is also pretty annoying.  I've experienced having a gas pump fail to work correctly a total of two times in my entire life.  In the 5 months I've had the EV6, I've had a charging failure due to a dispenser issue happen over a dozen times at various DCFC stations.  I realize it's a lot more complicated, but they (DCFC site and network operators) will need to do a much better job with reliability if they want people to switch to EVs.

**2) Excessive number of stops.**

At the 75-80mph speeds and 55-65F temperature that nearly all of my travel took place at, my EV6 manages 3mi/kWh (and that's if I'm being optimistic).  Since charging above 80% is slow and dropping below 10% is risky given the sparse infrastructure, only about 70% of my battery capacity is usable on a road trip (compared to 90%+ of the average gas tank).  That's roughly 160mi of usable range between stops, compared to 500+ in my Subaru.  I would have had to stop every 2 hours (likely even more frequently depending how distant the next charger was).  Additionally, many of the possible EV charging stops along my route (EA and dealerships in particular) were not really located somewhere desirable where there's easy access to bathrooms and snacks.  I understand some people might like to stop and stretch every 1.5 to 2 hours, but that's not me.  I want the drive to be over with as fast as possible and stopping makes it take longer.

**3) High DCFC prices relative to gasoline.** 

The Subaru cost between 8.8-9.7 cents per mile to drive on the highway (gas prices ranging $2.90-$3.20/gal at 33mpg), while the EV6 would have cost between 15.0-22.7 cents per mile due to the hugely variable yet consistently expensive cost of DCFC ($0.45-$0.68/kWh after sales tax at 3mi/kWh).  Even if I fully charged at home before leaving, this trip in my EV6 would have cost me almost double the cost of gas.  Gas prices were a lot less variable and did not have sales tax on top of them.  Additionally, it's way easier to compare gas prices as I don't need to go into a bunch of different apps to find the prices, I can just use one app for that.  If I want to know the price of an EA charger, I have to open the EA app.  If I want to know the price of an EVgo charger, I have to open the EVgo app.  This is a crappy experience.

At my destination there were limited options for hotels with L2 chargers.  The single hotel that did have EV charging costed $30 more per night which negated nearly all of the potential DCFC savings.  I booked that one anyway since at the time I wasn't decided on whether I was going to take the EV6 or not.  That hotel had 2 EV chargers - 1 Clipper Creek and 1 Tesla.  The Clipper Creek had a fault light on (which I expected after reading the PlugShare reviews), and the Tesla charger was in use the whole time so I wouldn't have been able to charge anyway.

**Final notes**

I do realize a lot of these issues are not as bad or may not even exist if you drive a Tesla.  I have seen that the Tesla nav does a great job minimizing unnecessary stops.  Tesla seems to also haves better efficiency and range than many comparable EVs so you can go farther between stops.  And finally, Supercharger charging cost for Tesla drivers are generally a lot more reasonable than DCFC costs for non-Tesla owners.  In my city it's 33 cents vs 56 cents.  Huge difference.  Only thing I don't like about the Teslas is the comparatively long 10-80% charging time vs my EV6.

Problem 1 will hopefully be solved if/when more gas station chains get into EV charging, so long as they don't put in ""slow"" fast chargers.  Problem 2 is solved with EVs that have larger/denser batteries and better efficiency (there are already substantially longer-range EVs that charge very quickly available on the market today, they are just prohibitively expensive for me).  Problem 3 I don't see being solved any time soon unless the government mandates open API access for live charging station data or something so that someone can make a single app to easily compare cost, which would help force stations to be more competitive with their pricing.

**TL;DR:**  America's DCFC infrastructure is still very sparse, unreliable, and expensive compared to gasoline.  Only a fraction of DCFC sites offer the high charging speeds supported by eGMP and many other 800V EVs.  Usable EV ""road trip"" range can be <60% of the advertised range due to lower efficiency at highway traffic speeds and due to only being able to effectively use the battery capacity that exists between 10% and 80%."

How is it living with an EV as an apartment dweller 
Hey y’all, I’m looking into getting a new car soon and I have narrowed it down to 2 cars that I want. I’m looking at a used Polestar 2 or a used Genesis G70. My current dilemma is that I live in an apartment complex and I plan on doing so for the foreseeable future. With this in mind, I am aware that I would have to rely on public chargers and in my experience. The NACS (Tesla) chargers have proven to be the most reliable. My main question is for non-Tesla EV owners, how do y’all manage on public chargers, how expensive is it ( I know it varies depending on location), would you recommend it or not and why? Keep in mind I drive almost every single day which means I would have to charge at least once a week. Thank you very much!"

My first year with an EV, why I am never going back
Last year, after totaling my gas guzzling Mercedes C300, I decided that I was finally going to give the electric car market a chance. I first bought a used 2020 Ford Fusion, which I quite liked, but I only owned it for a few months before my dad totaled his old POS 2002 Mercury Grand Marquis, which he basically drove into the ground. Now, insurance offered him 4000 bucks for this car, but my state, Colorado, offers 6000 for old gas powered cars IF you are planning on using the money to buy a new EV. So, I made my dad an offer he couldn't refuse, I traded him my 2020 Ford Fusion in exchange for 2002 POS. Then I traded the 2002 POS in for my 6000 and started looking for an EV. 



After shopping around quite a bit, I finally settled on the Hyundai Ioniq 6 SE. I have now owned this car for one year, and it has been a delight! It is by the far the nicest car I have ever owned, it is reliable, the ride is smooth and comfortable, it has a large amount of cargo space for a sedan (especially with the back seats folded down), it has acceleration that is absolutely OUT OF THIS WORLD, and it is a visually striking, unique and beautiful car.



Not only that, it is much cheaper to operate than any other car I have ever owned. I get to drive for the first two years for free, because the car comes with two years of free charging at Electrify America charging stations, but even after that, when I am doing most of my charging at home, I have found that it costs me, on average, about 8 dollars to fully charge my car at home. I usually charge about 4 times a month, so that works out to about 32 dollars a month to drive my car, compared to the roughly 270 dollars a month I was spending on gas for my old Mercedes, or 90 dollars a month with my Ford Fusion. It's not a perfect car, the frunk (front trunk) is so small that it's basically useless, the collision detection system is a bit too sensitive, it beeps at you sometimes even if nothing is in front of you, and the Apple Carplay is basically unusable because if you try to play music with it the sound will keep cutting in and out. Fortunately, if you just use bluetooth this isn't a problem, it's only an issue if you connect via USB. 



The knobs and dials on the dashboard are too small and kind of obnoxious to use, but at least the car has buttons, too many electric cars nowadays have no buttons at all, only a touchscreen. From what I have found, the range is actually slightly better than advertised too, I've been able to get 400 miles of range out of a single charge a few times. Usually I get about 360 to 370. I've taken this thing on multiple roadtrips now, including up into the Rocky Mountains and on back country dirt roads, and I haven't run into any problems. I've even taken it camping with me and found that it is quite a convenient camping car. Trips that would normally cost hundreds of dollars in gas are now basically free with the Electrify America free charging! 



I love that the back seats fold down too, I was able to haul a big vintage teak and jade desk that my father gave me by just shoving it in the trunk, putting the back seats down, and then shoving it up against the front seats. None of the other cars I have owned (all sedans) could have possibly fit this desk in their trunks. The storage space in the Ioniq 6 is impressive, and very convenient. In addition, the price is just right. I only paid 26k, after all the tax credits, rebates, and bonus cash, and I bought the car brand new!



I used all the money I got back from the rebates and whatnot to install solar panels on the roof of my house, and to have a level 2 charger installed in my garage. My above calculations about cost were NOT including the solar panels, so in reality my cost per month is probably even lower than 32 bucks. If I charge at night it costs me about 8 dollars, obviously since it is nighttime I can't use my solar panels but I do get cheaper electricity from Xcel Energy. I also get a 50 dollar bill credit every year if I only charge at night. If, on the other hand, I charge during the day roughly 50% of the electricity would be coming from my solar panels and then 50% would be coming from the grid. However, because of the way Xcel Energy's electricity pricing works, electricity is more expensive during the daytime, it works out to about...6ish dollars per charge. 



My wife, who comes from a country that doesn't really have EVs yet, is absolutely blown away by this car, she thinks it's a futuristic super car! 



That brings me to my next point about this car, and that is the reception I get while driving it. I've been made fun of for pointing this out on Reddit before, but this car really is a status symbol. When I brought it home my neighbors all came out to gawk at it, and my next door neighbor told me that it was ""too nice for the neighborhood, you better put it in the garage"". Lots of people have complimented me on it, and expressed total shock when I tell them what I paid for it (26k). 



Heck, my own family, including my own wife and her family, were in complete shock that I was able to afford this thing, because it does not look like a cheap car. I remember last Thanksgiving everybody had to come out and take a look at it and take a ride in it. Now they all think that I'm doing quite well for myself, better than I'm letting on, and one of my cousins decided he was going to one up me by buying a Cybertruck. A bunch of my relatives are buying EVs now because they feel like they're being left behind. Many of my friends now think I'm rich because of this car, and they're incredibly jealous. One of my friends even said ""Man, I need to get my life together so I can buy one of these!"" when he rode in it for the first time. 



Truth is though, I bought this car not because it is cool (even though it is), but because it would save me money. I was trying to be frugal and lower my monthly expenses as much as humanly possible, and the Ioniq 6 was one of only two EVs that met all my requirements. 



So, after one full year with an EV, I am NEVER going back to ICE cars. The monthly expenses for ICE vehicles are far too much for me to ever consider going back, especially with how much gas prices have risen. My wife is currently getting her learner's permit, she has never driven before, and we are on the hunt for a good electric starter car for her. I'm thinking of getting her a 2021 Hyundai Ioniq 1 Electric. One issue I have noticed in the EV industry is the lack of good starter cars. There are a few, but not as many as I was hoping for. "

OTA Update Bricked My 2022 ID.4 Pro S — Stuck in Garage, Anyone Successfully Resolved This?
Hey everyone — hoping someone here has some insight or advice.

Last night (around 9pm), I parked my 2022 ID.4 Pro S in my building’s low-clearance garage and initiated the latest OTA update. This morning, I went to check on the car and it wouldn’t start. The driver display showed the following error message:

**“Over-the-Air Update incomplete. Note warning indicators! See owner’s man.”**

**What I’ve tried so far:** 

*  I called VW support, and they recommended holding the infotainment power button for one minute, then waiting for the VW logo to appear, locking the car, and walking away for at least 30 minutes. I tried this twice — it didn’t work. 
* During this process, the infotainment system did power on briefly, showing the VW welcome screen for a few seconds, but then it went black and stayed that way. It never fully booted beyond that point. 
* Oddly, even though the system appeared mostly unresponsive, the Bluetooth still worked — when I called a friend from inside the car, the call audio routed through the ID.4’s speakers. 
* I contacted VW Roadside Assistance to schedule a tow, but because my garage has low clearance, the truck they sent wasn’t able to access the car or safely tow it. 
* A friend suggested disconnecting the 12V battery’s negative terminal as a reset to possibly trigger a reboot or allow the car to be shifted into neutral — but I couldn’t try it because of the tow complications.

**What I need help with:** 

1. Has anyone else had their ID.4 bricked after an OTA update? 
2. Would disconnecting the 12V battery help — or are there other reset procedures (like fuse pulls) that might kick the system back into gear? 
3. Is there any way to force the car into Neutral to roll it out of the garage for towing, even if the system is stuck mid-update?

It’s incredibly frustrating that VW pushed an update that left the car undriveable — and now Roadside and Service are offering no real help. At this point it feels like I’m stuck with a bricked EV in a garage I can’t get it out of.

Any insights from people who’ve been through something similar — especially those who’ve resolved it without dealership intervention — would be hugely appreciated.

**TL;DR:**

Latest OTA update failed on my 2022 ID.4 Pro S. Now the car won’t start, infotainment screen goes black after boot logo, and it’s stuck in Park. Bluetooth oddly still works.

VW support and roadside have been useless, and the tow truck can’t get into the garage. Looking for any DIY reset tips or tricks to force the update, reboot the system, or shift into Neutral so I can at least get it out of the garage.

**Any help is much appreciated!**"

Mokka-e Dead After Software Update – Collision Detection System Fault and Car Won’t Start – Need Advice
Hi everyone,

I’m hoping someone here might be able to help or advise me.

I have a Vauxhall Mokka-e. Recently, I was prompted via the Vauxhall app to complete a software update. I followed the instructions, downloaded the software onto a USB drive, and updated the car. However, during the first download attempt, one of the files became corrupted, and the process was incomplete. I later managed to download and install just the main software update (not the navigation update).

Ever since the update, my car has developed serious problems:

The dashboard displays a “Collision Detection Risk System Fault” warning.
The car does not lock or unlock properly — the hazard lights flash when I press the fob, but the doors don’t respond, and I have to use the manual key.
The car will not start at all — pressing the start button does nothing, and no ignition lights come on.
Before the update, the car worked perfectly without any issues.
At the moment, I have disconnected the 12V battery to try and reset the system, hoping it might recover after reconnecting.
I’m absolutely stuck and very worried that the software update may have bricked the car.

Has anyone experienced something similar with a Mokka-e (or Corsa-e, Peugeot e-208, etc)?
Could the incomplete software upload have caused this?
Is there anything else I can do before going back to Vauxhall?

Any advice or experience would be really appreciated!

Thanks in advance."

Road trip report: 1800 mi around SW USA in an EV9 that handled it like a champ
Just finished a road trip from Bay Area, CA --> Hoover Dam --> Grand Canyon --> Sequoia National Park --> Bay Area, CA in a 2024 EV9 Land, total \~1800 mi. Went through 60F sunny CA central valley, freezing 30s F rain/snow/hail climbing 1000s ft elevation in AZ, and basically everything in between. 

For our family, the EV9 worked great as a family road trip vehicle. It's comfortable, quiet, has solid level 2 ADAS, and the kids made good use of the relaxation seats which I initially thought was a gimmick but proved handy. Not the best efficiency, 2.5-2.7 mi/kWh going 70-90 mph on highway, but charged fast enough to make up for it. Our total road trip time was more determined by traffic and our biological needs than charging. Overall would drive \~2.5 hrs and charge 15-20 min as a routine, as guided by ABRP. 

Also, Electrify America between CA, NV, and AZ worked fine for us. Kia gets NACS/Tesla access next month, and I already have the adapter, but I’m not too anxious to get it now. The main downside is some sites were busy – but we only had one stop where we had to wait and that was for literally 5 min, and the kids spent longer anyway eating their lunch at the next door restaurant. I consistently got the max \~200-210 kW flat charging the EV9 handles at 350 kW stations; even got 176 kW out of a 150 kW stall. 

 

Plus:

·      I don’t think there’s a material difference between Tesla road tripping and Hyundai/Kia EV road tripping. We did a similar length road trip in a rented Model X a couple years ago and I don’t think we had a significance net difference of experience of time/convenience between the two. I’m sure Lucid would be even better. And it was unanimous that the EV9 is much more comfortable than the Model X.

·      I also don’t think there’s a significant difference of EV road tripping vs ICE now. At least me/my family are used to the cadence of EV road tripping, and the Kia charges fast enough and EA seems reliable enough to make it work out fine. 

But…:

·      The Tesla network is still better sited and has more chargers available.  Wherever we charged it seemed there was a Tesla site nearby that had a better location with better restaurants etc nearby, more chargers available, a canopy blocking sun/rain, etc. We get Tesla access next month. I’m still excited for that. 

·      Pricing of fast charging needs to change, else as is I racked up \~$100 more for kWh this trip than gas in an analogous hybrid/ICE roadtrip. I used my 1000 kWh free Electrify America credit this trip. And overall I save more by routine use vs that extra $100 on the occasional road trip. But this pricing, on top of EVs still being more expensive up front here than ICE/hybrid, will limit adoption. Not to mention that refueling gas is still definitely faster than charging batteries. For the uninitiated-to-EVs, if they road trip often, I still feel compelled to tell them to consider hybrid/PHEV, even as I’m personally all in on BEVs.

·      Kia’s route planning needs to improve. My ideal is still what I have in my Polestar 2 and its native Google maps. With that, I plug in the destination, it figures out my charging stops and preconditioning and gives me estimated battery % at destination so I can track how I’m doing. Here, the Kia route planning was plainly insufficient. I instead used ABRP and manually put the suggested charging stops into Google Maps and used CarPlay to navigate. I manually started battery preconditioning when I was 15-20 min from the destination. I can do this as I’m an EV geek. The median consumer won’t. With Volvo/Polestar’s setup the median consumer could acculturate fine; as with Tesla’s. Too bad the Model X is written off for us for varied reasons and the EX90 is still so buggy."

Review of 2024 Ioniq 5 SEL
2024 Ioniq 5 SEL review

PROS:
* Dual motor electric for instant feedback, torque and 0-60 in 4.5 seconds.(HUGE PRO)
* Electric is cheaper than gas (saving 100-200 a month) 
* No maintenance besides tire rotations / replacements. 
* Super fast charging compared to competition. 
* Comfy seats and plenty of rear passenger room
* SUV format better than my Mazda compact sedan format for cargo

CONS:
* Software is laggy and UI is clunky. Not a lot of software tech features. Feels like a basic normal car UI.
* No wireless carplay, only wired. And only USB that works for carplay is at the bottom front meaning a wire needs to run across the front. Stupid design choice.
* 1 pedal driving needs to be reactivated every single time car starts. Also reactivated every time you switch from reverse to drive (Have almost crashed car from this).
* Push to start? Most other electric cars just start automatically once you put foot on brake.
* Highway drive assist. It’s crap, cannot rely on it at all as it will turn itself off randomly without notice. Have heard much better things from GM and tesla. 
* Since its a crossover, the sloped trunk roof makes for less cargo room.
* Missing features my 28k 2017 mazda had such as rainsensing wipers and walk away locking. For a 50k vehicle, this is not okay.
    * I know if I upgraded to highest trim id get the rainsensing wipers but thats even more money
* No over-the-air-updates, something most if not all other electric cars do.
* 1 pedal regen strength feels weaker compared to others. Causing me to have to use brake more frequently.
* Frunk is ridiculously tiny. Absolutely no space. Basically no frunk. 
* Some touchscreen functionality lock out while driving. Examples are : can’t connect phone to Bluetooth while driving and cannot use onscreen keyboard. Both are stupid and forget we have passengers that can do this for us. It doesn’t necessarily distract the driver. 

Issues:
* heat randomly stops working. Some car drives we won’t have heat at all. Restarting car sometimes fixes it. And have noticed once where heat was working, stopped, then eventually resumed working all in the same drive. 
* Regen breaking just doesn’t work sometimes when I turn car on. The regen breaking level on my gauge cluster disappears and regen is completely off and the paddle shifters don’t change anything. Only fix is to turn off and back on car. 
* Another inconsistent issue is a motor noise when breaking. Restarting car also fixes this. But scary when happening since it’s a loud noise coming from front tires and bottom of car vibrates with the noise. 

Conclusion: Ended up having to go through Ohio’s lemon law and got a buyback from Hyundai due to my issues and car being in service for 3 months without fixing the issues. Sadly I feel as if legacy car brands are still years behind dedicated EV companies such as rivian lucid and Tesla. "

My Niro EV got in a little fender bender and my insurance said I could rent a tesla so I thought hey why not, I’ve never actually driven one. I hate it. 
I understand that my experience is skewed because I don’t own it, and that I don’t have my phone set as the key. Also yes first world problems and all that. 

I hate that it’s not a fob and I have to use the stupid card to open and start it. I haven’t had to pull a key out of pocket to open or start a car in over a decade. It’s especially irritating when I need to access the back like when I’m shopping. 

I also hate the no CarPlay, and I can’t use the Apple apps because Hertz doesn’t pay for the subscription so I’m stuck using Bluetooth like a Neanderthal. I won’t rent one again that’s for sure.

Are you still able to charge your phone in an EV even with the car off?
for reference, I have a 2023 Chevy Bolt EUV. I didn’t know if it’s the same situation for an ICE car where if you drain the battery from charging/using the AC with the car off, the car won’t start since the battery’s dead. But if the power comes from the battery cells itself, it doesn’t matter. "

Do we even still need cars in the city?
Hey everyone!

	So, I’ve been using a Onewheel for a while now, and I also ride my electric scooter pretty often. Honestly, I’ve been using my car less and less. It got me thinking: do we even still need cars in the city with all these other options?

	Here’s what I’ve noticed:

With my scooter or Onewheel, it’s way easier to get around without getting stuck in traffic.
	

Cars are expensive (gas, parking, maintenance…), but with micromobility, it’s way cheaper and simpler.


For daily trips, it’s quick, convenient, and way more fun!

That said, I won’t lie, cars are still useful for longer trips or when it’s pouring rain. But honestly, I’m starting to see public transport as a solid alternative too.

So what about you? Have you ditched your car for micromobility or do you mix things up? Do you think we could really go without cars in the city?

Looking forward to hearing your thoughts, especially if you juggle between cars, micromobility, and public transport!"

Level 2 charger efficiency question
I am in the market for a level 2 charger and my utility company will reimburse up to $500 for the purchase and installation of a new level 2 charger (as long as it is Energy Star rated). 

I currently need a J1772 charger for my Bolt EUV. Bells and whistles are not necessary and I have a separate 100amp meter for my garage so eventually coordinating charging between two EVs is not needed either.  I had initially narrowed it down to the Grizzl-e, Emporia, Wallbox Pulsar Plus, and Tesla Universal Charger.  I am concerned about the longevity of some of these companies and realize they are fighting in a highly competitive market where some of them (and their digital support) may not be around in 4 or 5 years after their warrantee runs out.  Although I’m not charging a Tesla, I liked the future-proofing allowed by the Tesla Universal charger having both J1772 and NACS as well. 

Beyond that, what caught my eye is the efficiency losses listed on the EPA website. When I started reading through the efficiency of multiple models I noticed that most have a loss of ~15 watts when charging at 15 amps and a loss of 50-60 watts when charging at 30 amps.  The only exception to this was the Tesla Universal Charger which only has a loss of 3 watts at both points as well as a loss of only 1.71 watts when at full power.  I understand that this data is self reported by the manufacturer but this seems like a sizable discrepancy.  Is this correct?  Can anyone provide any insight on this?  (Sorry the sub won’t let me post links to the Energy Star data)."

How to talk to anti-EV people (if you really have to)
Quite a few posts on this sub about the difficulties of talking to people who are hostile towards EVs, so I thought I would share some tips that I find useful doing so.

First, when entering any kind of debate, you have to set your goals appropriately. The goal should not be that your opponent completely agrees that they were wrong and you are right. For any kind of belief that people are emotionally invested in, this won’t happen. If you try to force it, the other person will just dug in more, no matter how absurd positions they have to take.

A more realistic goal is to be able to get a few good points across, that they can contemplate *later* and move their position closer to yours *later*. For this to happen the discussion needs to remain cordial and respectful. When people feel threatened they will clam up. It is also a good idea to make the other side feel they also made some good points that you will consider.

It is also useful to understand where most anti-EV people are coming from. Most of them would not give a damn about EVs if they were left alone. Instead, they feel that the whole transition is being forced on them. ICE vehicle ban pledges, tax incentives for EVs, Swedish teenagers yelling at them that they are bad people, etc. I think they have a point. If you agree (even if you think this forcing is for a good cause), you should sympathize with this feeling. People in general don’t like and resist stuff that is being forced on them.

So a good opening could be to say that you believe people should not be forced to buy EVs and should be able to make up their mind on what type of vehicle is the best for them. I always state this and it makes the rest of the discussion much easier.

The rest of my strategy is the following:

Step one, come to an agreement on use cases where EVs make a ton of sense. I usually try to have them come up with some of these. Second car in a city. Long range freight with planned routes and charging stops. Taxis, buses, local delivery vehicles. Etc.

Step two, once we identify that a good portion of ICE vehicles can be replaced by EVs, I start talking about who will make these. I ask them if they think China is playing fair in the global economy - most agree they don’t. I then point out that most of the government intervention is trying to counter that. They might come back with a different preference for this (e.g. tariffs or bans). I usually point out that these are also forms of government intervention, and then leave the conversation open on this point. I am not an economist and TBH not sure what is the best approach. At this point we both agree that the government has a role in EV transition, and this was my main point.

Another claim that frequently comes up is that EVs / electricity production hurt the environment too in some form. It is important to understand that these people usually don’t care about this at all. They bring it up because they think you do. So the best strategy I think is to not engage with this. I usually just s say we need to figure out clean energy anyways, and battery tech is constantly changing. I move back the discussion to the convenience, low maintenance and low cost of powering EVs.

I had a lot of success with the above tactics and most conversations ended on a friendly tone. One guy brought a Mach-E two years after I first debated him :)

Anyhow, I hope others find the above useful. Also interested in how others approach the topic?

When is charging going to be reliable?
Every time I think it’s getting better I end up at an inoperative charger and it screws up my trip. I never hear these complaints from Tesla owners. Why can’t the rest of the charger companies do a reasonable job of keeping there chargers running. Today, the chargers we stopped at on the way home; 2 were Chademo, 3 CCS, 2 completely dark, and the one that’s supposed to be working won’t start. "
98,2024-03-28 22:03:38,"electricvehicles
My “why Hertz sucks and our CCS infrastructure sucks” day.
Rented an EV6 for work. Last time I had one was tons of fun—took a road trip to buy a hitch for my XC90 on a layover day and had a grand tour of Upstate New York. Cue this time. It starts with Hertz (at least in Phoenix) no longer including the Level 1 charger in the car. I guess we wouldn’t be replenishing what we could overnight. 

Next, we drive around 100 miles to drop a pilot off. We could make it back to our VRBO but there was a fast charger right by a shopping center…so I figured I’d charge a bit while grabbing some groceries so that I could spend tomorrow’s layover day watching college hockey and not thinking about cars or food. Yup, charger broken. 

Not to worry, there’s a 200KW charger at a Subaru dealer “nearby.” We can sit for 10 minutes and be good to go. Touchscreen mostly unresponsive and even after activating on the Blink app neither cable will communicate with the car. I’m ready to throw in the towel and head north, but now the “what if all the fast chargers near our VRBO are broken” conversation starts. Sure would’ve been nice to just add 20 or 30 miles overnight with Level 1 and increase the search radius…

Found an outlet mall with a ton of Electrify America stalls. Paid $25 to go from 40% to 80%. Pretty sure that’s more than the same amount of gas would’ve cost. The EV6 is way more fun to drive than a Model 3 or Model Y, but Tesla fast charging is seamless. I’ll take a Tesla (or, flame away, my PHEV at home) for a road trip any day over a CCS vehicle.

Oh, to add insult to injury? The car was delivered at 100% charge. “Don’t worry, we won’t charge you if you bring it back above 95%.” So. Much. Facepalm."

^ This Reddit Moderator Went Outside to Rivian’s R2 + R3 Reveal
&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cgx0dr5gh5nc1.jpg?width=2738&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=905d824b5c6a675d36bf0447a913f7c6c5b2681a

Here’s a fun fact that you already know: I moderate the [r/Rivian](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/) subreddit, an online community of \~80k that really likes the electric vehicle Rivian churns out. Sometimes, when I say this, people assume I work for Rivian. “Oh. No. I and these other two guys do it for free. Like, in our free time.” That’s normally met with a, “OooOOoo… Wow…” or blank stare. But here’s the thing. Community management is important, and bringing people with shared interests together is one of my passions.

There are a lot of great benefits to this. We get to make people happy and provide them a safe place to connect. There’s the opportunity to connect directly with the people who make these vehicles, learning from them directly. And then, every once in a while, a special experience comes up.

Another fun fact: Reddit moderators do, actually, (sometimes) go outside. And that’s exactly what I did when Rivian invited me to attend the reveal of the R2 model yesterday. That’s right. I bravely put on clothes that made me look nice, hopped on a plane from SF to LAX, drove (an unexpected) 2.5hrs (in the pouring rain) to Laguna Beach, and had the opportunity to sit on stage while Rivian CEO, RJ Scaringe, showed off the company’s latest — and then some.

There are a lot of articles about the R2 by now. So I’m not here to give you an informational article. I’m here to tell you what it was like to attend this event, show you my own pictures, and share what stood out to me. In this blog, I don’t want to educate you about vehicle stats (*though this will be unavoidable at points).* Instead, I want to share how I received these reveals as someone who is inundated with Rivian content on the daily, and explain to you what I see behind the steel and lithium that these vehicles are made of.

# The Start of a Tumultuous Journey

It was pouring rain, and I was driving down South I-405 on my way to Laguna Beach for Rivian’s reveal of the R2 — a smaller, more affordable electric SUV launching in 2026. On my way, I found myself at a metaphorical intersection of transportation.

To my left was the Goodyear Blimp. In the lanes next to me I saw a Tesla Model 3, battered semi-truck, and a gas-guzzling pickup hauling auto glass. I was sitting in the BMW I rented on Turo. A Rivian R1S with manufacturer plates was ahead of me, probably headed to the same place I was. To my right was a giant billboard for the Kia EV9.

I was struck by the sheer number of ways people have tried to make transportation better — to varying levels of success and with dramatically unique solutions.

I’m more alert than usual to all of this because in just 24 hrs, I’ll be sitting in the South Theater watching RJ reveal *his* vision for EVs that will revolutionize travel. Looking around me, I’m imagining places Rivian has drawn inspiration: the boldness of the blimp, the practicality of the omnipresent American pickup, or the opportunity to reduce the harm from the exhaust all around me. The billboard for the EV9 shows me that Rivian isn’t the only one feeling inspired.

https://preview.redd.it/yvx3aoe2h5nc1.jpg?width=2719&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=8569a3db1e3d7e145760fbfceda25ecbf74330cd

But what is this inspiration worth if Rivian isn’t around to realize it?

While I believe in Rivian, and I don’t think they’ll go belly up, I do recognize that the company is in a similarly precarious position to early Tesla. They have a successful, expensive model out that appeals to a limited demographic, are burning through cash, and quite literally need their next, more affordable model to be successful. The success of the company hinges on the reveal I’m driving to.

There’s much written about the EV valley of death Rivian is currently trudging through. Complicating things: EV sales are up overall, but so too are interest rates, and YoY growth rates have slowed.

It’s going to be tough. Rivian plans to be gross margin profit positive this year, but to get there, they need to shut down the plant for several weeks. They don’t plan to produce more vehicles than they did last year (even though deliveries may be up). The plant building this new vehicle has only just broken ground, costs $5B, and won’t be spitting out R2s until 2026.

I’m fascinated by these challenges. I’m into this electric car company like other people (who are very different from me) are into football teams. So, reasonably, when Rivian invited me to the reveal of the R2, I jumped at the opportunity to glean everything I could from the event, staff, and to be the first to see these vehicles live.

So, what did I learn? What could I tell about not only the R2, but also the future of Rivian — a brand I admire deeply for their impact migrating folks away from large, polluting ICE vehicles?

Buckle your seatbelt. I’ll tell you everything.

# Respite and Reflection

I made it to the event greeted by the familiar sight of those iconic headlights and got a bit of rest. As I fell asleep, I got stressed out about work. I’m working a lot right now, and I was trying to not stress too much about what I would strike off my to-do list in the early hours before the event.

This felt silly.

Here I am, in my posh hotel room, stressing while RJ and his teams are about to either rebuild faith in their vision or whiff to catastrophic results.

One notable tragedy of my stay was that I forgot my toothpaste and was given toothpaste *pellets* that you chew and then brush your teeth with. I did not know these existed. I regret learning that they exist. They are awful.

https://preview.redd.it/3w1s91n3h5nc1.png?width=1074&format=png&auto=webp&s=18feee34b01cb511bec5cc9271faa614311cc51c

“Sure,” I thought, “RJ is probably having a tough time sleeping ahead of the biggest moment for his company yet, but at least he has normal toothpaste as opposed to this apocalyptic torture device in the form of a powdery white pellet.”

I was comforted knowing that RJ and I were both having an equally challenging time. I closed my eyes and drifted into dreamland, ready for the day ahead.

# Two Headlights at the End of the Tunnel

After brushing my teeth *with another toothpaste pellet*, I hopped in a Lyft, got a big coffee, met my other moderators (*they are great, I love them*), and got in line at the South Theater right next to the beach which Rivian has turned into a dedicated hub.

The energy was electric. *(Are you tired of these puns yet?)* Rivian employees were surprised we were there so early and appeared to get a jolt of energy *(sorry not sorry)* at our enthusiasm.

Standing in line, I checked in with myself about what I realistically expected from this event:

* Hear about Rivian’s progress so far
* See the R2 and learn its specifications
* Get to check out the R2 close up

Ho boy. If I only knew what we were getting ourselves into. Not to spoil things, but the R2 wasn’t the big reveal.

When we got inside I was seated on stage with \~5 other community leaders in the Rivian space — including the Rivian Club of America and a very badass woman who competed in the Rebel Rally in her R1. Everyone else who wasn’t press was in the mezzanine. How did I secure such a seat? Your guess is as good as mine.

Sorry, what I meant was, “Your guess *isn’t* as good as mine.” The night before, marketing asked the Reddit mods to pick a number between 1 and 15 and I guessed right to secure a coveted stage seat.

Here’s what you’re told when you come to a press event that’s pivotal to the eventual success of a company whose stock price recently plummeted after earnings and whose success is hinging on the content in the next \~30 min:

* You may not have any bags, water, coffee, or anything else with you.
* You may not leave your seat once the presentation starts.
* Be yourselves and cheer. We invited *you* for a reason.
* You’re in RJ’s line of sight for a lot of this. I felt an unexpected responsibility when I was told this. I committed to encouraging eyes and a wide smile. And I was happy to do it.
* Silence your cell phones or you will be killed on the spot. *(Editor’s note: the author embellished the consequence)*

I was starting to get pretty hyped. As a musical theater nerd — that’s right, I like big pickup trucks *and* Sondheim #multifaceted — I couldn’t help but analyze the production. There was clearly a turnstile in the middle of the stage and a serious camera setup. The screen was obviously going to split down the middle to reveal the R2, and I started imagining it. My heartbeat increased and I could feel the jitters of the Rivian staff all around me.

While I was waiting, I reflected on just exactly what I was doing here. Here I am in Laguna Beach after paying my own way to a multi-billion dollar company’s product reveal. And I’m expected to cheer. And I *want* to cheer. Do I love capitalism *this* much?

Well. Listen. We live in a society. I’m not the guy who is going to say we should break down all our systems and rebuild them or that we should tear up all our roads to replace them with bike lanes and trains (*though a lot more of that second part would be amazing and I support it*). But I *am* that guy who thinks we need to electrify our personal transit methods. Whether that’s hybrids or full electric, we need to do it. And to do it, we need to give buyers really compelling options to get them to deal with the inconveniences of EV ownership today–like charging.

I viewed my role here as someone who could help push that forward. Rivian was about to invite a whole lot more people to stop burning dinosaur blood.

RJ took the stage in front of Rivian’s motto: Keep the world adventurous forever. It resonates with me. It’s optimistic, aspirational, and easy to connect with. As someone who used to drive his 4Runner through the Sierras and now drives his R1T on the same routes, I personally feel that I’m doing my small part to more responsibly experience what Earth has to offer.

https://preview.redd.it/xu12s6o7h5nc1.jpg?width=2738&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=5ed3e100a1a39df2d7d8acfbe1dcb55e090c5898

*Note:*[ *EVs are better for the environment than gas vehicles, no matter their size, even though they start with a larger carbon footprint*](https://www.nytimes.com/2022/10/19/business/electric-vehicles-carbon-footprint-batteries.html)*. While it takes larger EVs longer to become a positive influence than smaller ones, they are still net-better. Offering consumers larger, more capable vehicles encourages folks with the most polluting vehicles to consider electrifying.*

RJ talked a bit about Rivian’s accomplishments, showed aspirational marketing photos and videos of folks exploring, and shared how excited he was to be here. All expected. There’s a lot of press here.

But there was one part that really stuck out to me. He mentioned how he wants to create vehicles that inspire people to be their best selves.

My Reddit moderator brain latched onto this as a contrast to Elon. It’s no secret that Elon’s volatile persona is harming the Tesla brand. He’s echo-chambering himself on Twitter and removing content moderation policies to cater to bullies. In my experience moderating [r/Rivian](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/), the Tesla hive mind is flatly toxic. If we ever need to remove a post or comment, there’s almost always a Tesla connection.

With this line, RJ continued to separate himself from an increasingly extremist Musk. I viewed it as extremely intentional to further drive the wedge between an optimistic Rivian future and the dystopian CyberTruck vision. It was punchy and a jab — RJ’s, “When they go low, we go high,” moment. I don’t know if Rivian viewed it that way. But they must have, right?

Perhaps the biggest contrast was that RJ seemed prepared. Comparing this to the CyberTruck reveal, it’s pretty obvious to me which CEO I’d want to work for.

# We R Excited for R2

FINE. I’LL TALK ABOUT THE VEHICLES. Gosh…

The screen split in half (called it), the R2 was driven out, and it was rotated on the turnstile so we could all get a good look at it. Slam. Dunk. Looking like its significantly more expensive sibling the R1S, the R2 is what people were hoping for. The cheers were so loud that someone’s Apple Watch started calling 911 because it thought there was an emergency.

https://preview.redd.it/kf340sgah5nc1.jpg?width=2738&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=e1bcc4fe36332042ed3bdd00b5bf8c8075a3467e

Again, there is so much written about the specs of this vehicle. So instead I’ll share the five main things that stuck out to me:

* It’s only slightly bigger than a Honda CRV and the Model Y, but with significantly more headroom and storage.
* Starting at $45,000 before any rebates, this thing is priced better than expected. Sure, it will change a bit by launch in 2026, but uh. Winner.
* Deliveries start in the first half of 2026, earlier than expected. Rivian is doing this by utilizing their existing Normal, IL plant. The original plan was to build the R2 at a new plant in Georgia which hasn’t been built yet. Rivian is pausing work and capital expenditures there (saving $2.5B) to ramp up a new line for R2 in their current factory. Suddenly that multi-week shut down of the plant announced in their earnings call makes a *lot* more sense. I wish I saw that coming. You could almost feel investors in the room let out a sigh of relief.
* This thing is for suburbanites. “Adventure” when looking at the R2 is a trip to Whole Foods with three screaming kids. It’s a smart marketing pivot from their much more capable R1 series which was showng climbing rock faces and splashing through streams when they were unveiled.
* The drop window in the back a la Toyota’s 4Runner is genius. I firmly believe that the 4Runner’s drop window is a deeply beloved feature and incorporating it into the R2 will attract current 4Runner owners to convert to Rivian just like I did.

*Note: I've run out of images for this post. Sorry! The rest are on my Medium.*

Cool! Expectations met. I saw the vehicle. It had great specs. I am satiated and feeling good. I have a sense that Rivian has just built confidence and secured their future.

But then…

# Siblings

When RJ said that the R2 had a sibling, we screamed. It was involuntary. We all expected a little two door pickup. The night before at dinner, we had all imagined that the R2 may very follow the R1 model of have a “T”ruck and a “S”UV.

When that “3” showed up on the screens… We stood up. We screamed. It didn’t matter I was told to scream. I would have screamed if I was told I wasn’t allowed to. When this little hatchback R3 drove out, real, and feet from me I had ‘That’s So Raven’ vision of this thing all over SF. Then I thought about the Fisker Ocean that parks on my street and wondered what its owner would think of this.

The fact that no one saw this coming says a lot about Rivian. They’re disciplined. They’re calculating. They’re professional. It builds confidence.

We don’t know pricing, but we know it’s going to be cheaper than the R2.

# “One More Thing”

I remember where I was when I watched Steve Jobs, “One More Thing” for the first time. It was Chesapeake, Virginia. I was a teenager in my mom’s office watching a livestream on the internet we got not all that long ago. It was my first, “Oh shit. I love technology.” moment. Part of me always yearned to be present for a moment like that.

“One more thing…” RJ said. This will sound dramatic, but time slowed.

If you watch [this video](https://www.threads.net/@prcgibson/post/C4OR71mPREM) with sound on, you’ll hear what I can only describe as a newly gained core memory.

A third model rolled out, the R3X — a more capable version of the R3 and oh mannnnnn do I think it looks neat. The side mirrors, the two-toned seats, the cork dashboard… It’s neat. It’s so neat.

# Energized.

I gotta wrap this up.

Rivian needed the R2. But they overdelivered at this event, showing not only their near future, but their long term future as well. Despite the climate of EVs overall, it showed me that Rivian is solidifying its place as the visionary leader in the EV place. These vehicles have a perspective — thank you lead designer Jeff Hammoud—and a character. They are uniquely Rivian and everyone is invited.

When we got up to look up close at the vehicles, we were all stunned.

I’ll include pictures I took at the end of this article so you can see them, but I wanted to close with what the feeling in the room was:

Confident. Relieved. A bit of exhaustion from the Rivian staff. Inspired.

Rivian needed this. Up until this event, it felt like Rivian’s battery may have been running out (*last one, promise).* This event fast charged them (*I lied)* into the next couple of years that will, undoubtedly, be rough. Remember, they’re still in that EV Valley of Death. But if any company is going to emerge from it, it’s going to Rivian with their R2, R3, and R3X in tow.

Condos & HOA
Hi! I currently have a garage at my rented condo and it works great to L1 my i3. However I’m about to start my house (condo) hunt and I’m concerned out finding places that will allow me to charge, because a lot of places I see just have a carport and not a garage. My car only gets around 80 miles of range so I NEED to plug in nightly. 

Has anyone gone through this? I’m considering just asking each HOA to see if charging from the regular 120v outlets that most car ports have is acceptable… but I’m afraid that most hoas are retired Karen’s that won’t understand. I’m in Arizona so I don’t think there is any laws that will help me."

Is it ok to disconnect the 12v in an electric Corsa?

The car won’t start and I get the below message. Some google searches say disconnect the battery 20/30 minutes should fix it.

CCS fast charging guide for Florida travelers
Say you live or are visiting in Florida, and want to take an extended trip through Florida, and don’t have a free charging perk with your vehicle, here’s the heirarchy of options:

FPL Evolution:
Has by far the best fast charging rates in Florida at ~37¢ per kWh (30¢ advertised with additional utility and gross receipt tax of ~12.5%). I’ve had a session fee range from $0 to $1.00 with no rhyme or reason from location to location. They only take a $1.00 hold when you start the charge that gets adjusted to the proper price paid as soon as the charging ends.  

The location charging speeds range from 120 kw to 350 kw, with 240kw and 350kw being the most common. 

These locations always seem to have several food options around them, and a 90% chance of a Dunkin’ in walking distance

Electrify America:
has the second lowest at 48¢ per kWh, but I avoid them because they like to take out a $50 hold that doesn’t immediately update to the true cost. They are also swamped by those with free charging perks who charge way longer than needed for their trip. 

Each location I’ve visited usually have multiple 150 kw cabinets and a couple 350kw cabinets

You will 90% end up in a Walmart/Sam’s parking lot.

ChargePoint:
follows right after at 50¢ per kWh , and have become much better after they added the pay as you go option. I believe it’s also a $1 charge that gets updated immediately after the charge. 

I’ve only seen the fast chargers at Wawa thusfar, with 125 kw charging speeds, but there are 350 kw cabinets

EVgo:
Is the most expensive option for regular driving hours. During regular commute hours (8am and 9pm) they are priced at 57¢ per kWh. They have time based pricing that becomes competitive if you are traveling between midnight and 5am at 43¢ per kWh. Any other time frame is 49¢ per kWh. They have a $1 service charge that gets tacked on. Beware: They will take a $50 authorization hold, then charge the amount charged separately, then drop the $50 hold. So it could easily take $80 away from your account temporarily. 

These chargers are generally the slowest too, the 350 kw chargers are far and few, with 100 kw being way more prevalent (and if you check PlugShare, you’ll more likely average 50 kw). I admit I have had nothing but horrible experiences at EVgo and am very biased against them. Nobody wants to pay a premium for the slowest charge. 

They do seem to have decent locations in my experience though with good food options around. You’ll want a sit down restaurant though cause you will need the extra time to get you going again. 

Route planning:

I always plug my end destination in PlugShare first to see what charging options are available in the area, then try and book a stay around charging availability. 

Then I plug my route into A Better Route Planner (ABRP) to see where in the trip it recommends me to charge, and for how long. If it’s not FPL EVolution, I switch to PlugShare and search the area of the recommended charge to see if one is close, check amenities in the area, and check recent reviews to ensure I won’t have an issue on arrival with whatever charger I choose. Which is a critical step if you want to save the headache of arriving to a dead or slow charger. 

After that, it’s a go on the trip"

Another LEMON Rivian (BECAUSE RIVIAN TOOK THIS DOWN)
THIS IS WHAT RIVIAN IS TRYING TO HIDE! why else will they remove this post ?(Sorry, this post has been removed by the moderators of [r/Rivian](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/))

[https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1873lm1/2023\_consumer\_report\_gives\_rivian\_a\_very\_low/](https://www.reddit.com/r/Rivian/comments/1873lm1/2023_consumer_report_gives_rivian_a_very_low/)

DO NOT BUY A RIVIAN, IT IS A DANGEROUS, POORLY DESIGNED GOLFCART!

We bought our R1S in 2018, waited 5 years hoping this vehicle will be all that they hyped it to be and we got a LEMON! turns out we are not alone, the forums are packed with people asking Rivian to buy their car back, we did too and were told that because we don't have enough social media presence they won’t consider us. THER IS A BUY BACK PROGRAM, but only if you are hurting their brand they will buy it back. we didn't want to talk $#!t about it, we tried to be civil and help them take it back and give us back our money but at this point we have nothing to lose.

Our Rivian Story:

we waited 5 years for our car 5!!!! YEARS!!!! (they lied and pushed all of their employees ahead of many of you and us who gave them $1000 and hoped it will be out by 2020, we got ours in 2023!)We know people who joined Rivian in 2021 and got a R1S before us, they ordered their car after joining.

mid 2023 the car showed up and off the bat, day 1, the car had issues.(removed this bit as people are offended by the wrong thing)

&#x200B;

1. Rattling in the front of the windshield. we are not talking s mall noise, this was unbearable, the entire plastic under the windshield was echoing at low speed. took it back to the shop, they claimed the fixed it day 1. we took it to them 4 more times to fix that same noise, every time we were promised it is resolved only to find out that hot days remove the glue they used and now its still making the same noise (NO FIX!), their support people even mentioned that they had to redesign the parts to stop doing that on the newer batch (as if it solves my issue).
2. We put the car in storage and decided we are selling it as it has all of these noise issues and the brand seemed clueless as to how to fix a $96K car. The car was in storage and from time to time we showed it to potential buyers, every time it came out of storage it had a different issue, so we could not sell it!
   1. on our 5th service appointment and less than 500 miles on the car they replaced another panel in the back door as it was disengaged and making noises, the car was in storage, don’t even know how these things are happening without any usage to the car.
   2. on the 6th service still under 500 miles they fixed their compressor issue by replacing the entire thing.
   3. we are now 650 miles in and a software update pushed by them locked the car, drained the battery including the 28v battery and the car had to be towed, 2 days of work lost trying to make them fix it first and they had over 50 of those happen in Denver alone. They took responsibility and said it is a failed software update, I cant even imaging what did the other 50 do if they were not close to their home, ours was in storage, that took a while to pull out as the wheels are locked in one direction. Great towing service.
   4. 700 miles in, we started noticing the trim on the back passenger window is starting to detach from the car, took them 2 months to approve a fix and then they replaced both parts (no charge as apparently this is happening to a lot of Rivians)
3. Before we stored it we kept it out next to our house, two weeks later the car went through some hail damage.
   1. There are a VERY SMALL number of body shops who are allowed to touch your Rivian, most body shops don’t want to partner with Rivian and the ones that do are overbooked and to be honest, are ripping us all off.
   2. Had to fix some dents on the hood, nope, they changed the hood completely, plastic parts had crack that required them replaced, how is an off road vehicle so flimsy? We had our 2012 Jeep GC out next to the Rivian in that hail storm, 4 bumps on the hood and the roof, 4!, and they fixed them for less than $200.
   3. The roof of the car is a full glass panel, be aware, it cracks easily and will require a specialist to install (took them another $4,500 for the roof alone), waited a full 5 weeks for that part alone. FIVE WEEEEEEKS!!!!
   4. Roof has a GPS antenna on it, no apparent damage to the thing, but the car just stopped receiving any signal, they had to replace the thing, more thousands spent on them replacing that.
   5. Total bill 15K! and I am sure our premium will bump up higher once they realize how bad these cars are made and how awfully expensive and hard it is to fix them.

The service people are always apologetic and in many cases sound like they are dealing with poor quality issues all day long, nothing of the things I shared here surprised them, nothing was a “first” for them, and this brand is not even 3 years on the road. I owned luxury cars before, I have friends who worked in car sales, vehicle design, vehicle testing, I myself led a project in car infotainment systems testing years ago. We all came to the same conclusion, This car is just poorly designed and built. That’s the fact.

And other than having 4 motors (speed, not even good snow traction), it really does not perform that well, it is uncomfortable to drive, loud, and unintuitive to operate.

DO NOT BUY A RIVIAN, IT IS A DANGEROUS, POORLY DESIGNED GOLFCART!"

Give us your EV report! (3+yr, 36K+ mi/50K+ km)
Would love a thread of EV owners offering anecdotes about their cars with some life on them: either 3+ years or at least 36K miles/50K kilometers.

To make formatting easier, some loose guidance:

* Year Make Model - Trim

* Miles / KM driven

* Short summary of “the good” about the car

* List of minor problems — anything that doesn’t affect drivability, like rattles, squeaks, panel gaps, NVH, buggy infotainment (that doesn’t affect HVAC or safety), etc, dead 12v batteries, slow charging, etc 

* list of major problems — car won’t start, car won’t shift to/from a mode, stranded (not human error), infotainment failure == no HVAC or speedometer, no charging, tow required, etc. 

* would you buy or lease car/brand again?"

Fisker Ocean - 3 Month Owner Review
[Fisker Ocean](https://preview.redd.it/clbs9k8jnhbc1.jpg?width=5712&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=96e03b44d3ee3423aaec05f2a4c1b2ca3993853a)

I'd like to provide an honest review of the Fisker Ocean, after 3 months of ownership.

**Context**: I'm an avid car enthusiast, who has subscribed to Car and Driver since age 8. I've leased many cars, including the Alfa Romeo Giulia, Stelvio, Q50 Red Sport 400. I've been following Fisker since 2012, and was excited to see the Ocean in 2020.

**The Good:**

* Build Quality
* Paint
* Good Value for the money based on features and range.
* Design - Beauty is in the eye of the beholder, but I think it looks great.
* Vehicle engineering - It's very solid. In a crash test with another car that Magna engineered the battery pack enclosure for, that car held up better than the Tesla Model Y. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDisARXq8e0&t=1s](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zDisARXq8e0&t=1s)
* Interior - Great - The steering wheel is a different shape, but I'm used to it now. The headliner is also very nice, at least on my sea salt.
* Power - Great acceleration
* Brakes - Great
* User Interface - I like it. It isn't the best out there obviously, but I don't buy a car based on the UI.
* Handling - Great for what it is. Steering is not quite as precise as my Stelvio, but it doesn't need to be. For everyday driving, its perfect.
* Comfort - Great. I felt it was much more comfortable than the Tesla model 3 and Y.
* Seats - Very comfortable
* Sound system - Great - Probably on par with upgraded sound systems in luxury cars. Its a Panasonic ELS system. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfVsHdV8kCo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MfVsHdV8kCo)
* Headlights - Great
* The solar roof - Mine was tinted, so it has no sun pattern visible in the car at all. Its completely a non-issue.
* Taco Tray - Nice - I took a meeting in the car, and its a nice place for a laptop.
* Warranty - Fantastic - 6 years, and 10 years on battery to 75% degradation, not 70% like everyone else has. CATL makes the battery.
* Engineered to lower insurance costs. Many of the panels were designed to be replaced in an accident. My insurance is the lowest of any car I've had in recent memory.
* The ADAS hardware is there. The Ocean comes standard with 5 digital imaging radars (very few cars on sale today have imaging radar), 5 exterior cameras, including an 8mp front camera. Magna owns the entire ADAS package, so I'm hoping good things will come from this. [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWXiiQ-n1Fo](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=kWXiiQ-n1Fo)

**The Bad:** The silver lining is that these are all things Fisker can reasonably fix (I hope).

* The Customer Experience getting the car delivered for me was poor. Fisker have apparently improved this process.
* The Key was problematic, but hasn't been recently with software updates. Fisker only provided 1 key due to supply issues. Phone as a key is coming, and Fisker have stated they are redesigning the physical key.
* Finicky Software: I've had a couple times where the screen has gone off, or I get error messages when starting the car.  A reset fixes these, but obviously its no fun to deal with.
* 12V - I had the 12v battery die and get replaced. This is partly due to software, which has since been updated, and I think partly due to the car not being charged for a long period while on the ship from Europe. I had the 12v changed a month ago and haven't had an issue since.
   * As an aside, my service tech was top notch, came to my house. He was obviously very experienced in working on EVs.
* Missing Software: Some features are missing, like hill hold, adaptive cruise control. These will come via OTA.

**What's Next:**

* Fisker has committed to improving the customer experience, and they have. Fisker announced just a few days ago that they will be moving to a dealership model. This is similar to Vinfast, and I think its the right thing for Fisker.
* Fisker is quick to fix and have already deployed redesigned parts within months. They've already changed the seat occupant sensors and HVAC vents due to issues initial owners had.
* Fisker has committed to delivering a Version 2 of the vehicle software in Q1 2024, which is honestly sooner than I was expecting. This will include most of the missing ADAS features, other features, and (cross fingers) software stability improvements.
* Fisker hasn't provided cars to many journalists, which is why you haven't seen many youtube videos from the usual reviewers. Fisker wasn't even in the running for Motor Trend SUV of the year for this reason. It wouldn't have won with the current software though. Once the software is ""ready"" I expect Fisker to lend the car to journalists.
* The biggest concern I have is potential Fisker bankruptcy. I think the move to transition to a dealership model is good, mainly to help conserve cash, but also to improve the customer experience.

**Recommendation:** I do recommend the Ocean, and I'm happy I got mine. If you are risk averse, definitely wait a couple months until V2 of the vehicle software is deployed in February or March to see how much of the current owner complaints are addressed.

If you do make a reservation, use a reservation code so someone can get a free tshirt. If you want to use my code, it is 8YLKR7. Thanks"

Hertz Only Rents EVs
I have rented from Hertz Car Rental for two decades. This current rental, the agent in my downtown New York City location said that all rentals at the location are now ONLY EVs. I said, ""I didn’t choose one"", and she said, sorry, you’ll need to take it. It’s a u/Kia EV6.

I have never driven an EV before. I am a complete newbie to this. I drove away with it anyway (it was Thanksgiving day and I needed to get to family) and with a pretty full charge, I figured I could make this work.

It did not work well.  I started on the NJ Turnpike and at one of the rest areas saw the only charging stations are for Tesla. Not even knowing they are incompatible, I discovered this as soon as I tried to insert the charger into my car. Note: there were no non-Tesla chargers anywhere to be seen.  And Hertz did not provide an adapter so I could charge at a Tesla charger.  I didn't know obviously to ask for this.

I get to my hotel which has two EV charging stations. I download the app (Enel X), register an account, and it won’t work. I call the help line from the app and am connected to someone in South Africa who can’t solve my problem. I give up: I find out from the hotel front desk that the charging station has yet to be activated (I note that the station was there six months ago). I complain: “Just activate it.” The reply: “You’ll need to call the hotel manager tomorrow”. Remember, it’s Thanksgiving day.

I then spend two hours researching what to do and where to go. Figured out Tesla and my Kia have separate charging systems. Find a ChargePoint charging station a mile away and spend 30 minutes charging from 50% to 80%.

But now I realized that I’ll have to do that again when I return the rental to Hertz in Manhattan.   I research charging stations on Google maps in Manhattan.  All are in condo buildings or monthly parking garages.   I stopped in one garage and the attendant told me that only monthly parking clients can use the charging station.

Hertz gave me NO advanced warning or emails about the mandatory EV renting policy.  Nor did they provide guidance on how and where to charge the car.   And how we are expected to return the car charged when there are no pubic charging stations near the rental location.

There are people who don’t know about EVs who are being forced to rent them. With no knowledge or advanced warning.  I am still incredulous, six weeks later.

Has anyone else experienced this with Hertz?"

The whole NACS certification and adoption will do nothing to ""solve"" the public charging problem....
Multi EV owner here....    Also, an exhausted consumer of public charging that literally never works.  At dozens of charge stations of probably every charge network I've tried, it just never works, especially in the winter.

The Plug or voltage will do NOTHING to solve the broader charging problem.  Its profoundly naïve to believe that it will affect anything.  Plenty of internet dweebs that are either Tesla shills that think they have ""won"" or others who know nothing about the why public charging is so bad might think there is a silver bullet, but there simply isn't.  Sure, I'd like a smaller plug for fast charging, but it still won't do a damn thing because its not the source of the problems.

Yes, Tesla did a great job building an integrated singular system to charge their cars, They are also really good at maintaining their own equipment..  But for charging to work more broadly across likely billions of cars and multiple OEMs in the next century, the entire process needs profound simplification.

Our species knows how to plug things in and move voltage and current over wires.  We've been doing it for nearly 150 years with little fanfare.   My home charging works perfectly every.... single.... time.  The basic hardware works 100% of the time (we have a Ford, Emporia, and Grizzl-E chargers).   There are plenty of physical plugs used around the Earth in different countries, but they all move voltage exactly the same way.  Not one is better than any other.

Its all the software and garbage that the charging and car companies have encumbered the charging process with.  All the junky ""apps"", the wildly unreliable payment systems, the touch screens, the ""Plug and charge"" ideology, the obsession to use phones for literally everything, the handshaking protocols, and all the trash we've surrounded the basics of charging with have made this whole public charging process a folly.   Its a software debacle, and a shameful display of stupidity by otherwise well intentioned people.

But in nearly all cases, its the inability to enable the  basic charging hardware to move voltage to my cars.  All the crap required to just turn on the charger and start the flow of electricity is what breaks.  And unfortunately, having participated in many standards bodies over the years, those are the last places to solve these problems, as they move at a glacial pace.  And even if some standards bodies weigh in on these non hardware problems, it could take decades before things change....

The moving of electricity is simple, but the EV industry has made it darn near impossible to do it reliably."

Small comparison
I have had the opportunity to drive 3 EVs, the Kia EV6, the Model Y, and the Mach-E (which I own). I have some thoughts, and I thought I would share them in case someone else is trying to make a buying decision and isn’t sure what to buy.

Let’s talk about the Model Y first, especially since it is the best selling car in America right now. I got it as a rental for a few days while running some errands around town, and it is honestly a really good car. It charges fast, the screen provides a ton of information, it is quick, and it handles like a much smaller vehicle. That is where my positivity about this vehicle stops. The build quality that often gets discussed isn’t a big deal, but it feels extremely spartan in the interior. Everything being on the screen means that I am looking farther to my right whenever I need to check the map to see where I am going. That leads to me not paying enough attention to what is in front of me, which, when I was relying on autopilot caused emergency braking to activate on the highway. Autopilot is a substandard system in this day and age, especially with the multiple phantom braking instances I dealt with. Parking with vision only is garbage, you can’t trust it enough to rely on it, so I had to repark a few times (but this could also just be due to me not feeling comfortable).  ~~And for all the hype about the software, not being able to use android auto or apple carplay is stupid, since I would be googling where I am going to type the address into the Tesla Nav (A waste of time)~~ (You can apparently send it to the car through the app. My bad.) . Finally, I had the screen just shut down on me while driving back from the grocery store, which legitimately felt like an unsafe situation since I was driving pretty much blind in regards to my speed.

Next we have the EV6. There’s a lot to love about this car. The steering and pedal feel are fantastic, the interior feels cozy, and I love the buttons for climate control, as well as the clear buttons on the steering wheel. The car charges super duper fast, with 20-80% taking roughly 20 minutes while road tripping. The HDA system works pretty well at keeping the lane even on small roads, and while the “Keep your hands on the wheel” notification is annoying, it is roughly the same as the Tesla. The frunk is useless, but honestly, that would be fine considering that my gas car never had a frunk and I was fine for the longest time. They got sooooooo much right with this car that the next complaints are disappointing because they are so small, but they are such a big deal in terms of living with the car. I had some trouble with the brake because I was trying to let the one pedal driving slow me down, The ***BIG*** Achilles heel of this car is everything going on with the navigation. For those of you that don’t know, you can’t use wireless android auto/carplay, and the wired has to be through USB-A. From what I have seen on a Kia Niro EV (Absolute shit. DO NOT BUY THIS CAR, don’t want to talk about it), which has the same system, the wired connection is unreliable. That brings me to the in-built Nav. I was renting this car for a long drive, and the destination was just a bit further than the range of the car. This was something I was aware of, and I had planned to stop. I tossed my destination into the nav, and it said “Insufficient charge to reach destination, find a charger” but when I clicked on find a charger, it offered L2 chargers near by with a few fast chargers. That is a half baked solution in a $60k car. (***EDIT: This has apparently been fixed in an update, and the car I was driving did not have it)*** It was fine for me because I use ABRP and Plugshare religiously, but if you don’t know about those, this car will probably leave you stranded. I also know that if you use Android Auto/Carplay it won’t give you turn by turn nav in the dashboard.

Finally, the Mach-E. Clearly I love this car because I bought one. It rides well, it is on par with the EV6 in comfort, but more comfortable than the Model Y. It has certain buttons that are Tactile so you don’t need to take your eyes off the road while driving, such as starting bluecruise, the windshield wipers, the gear selector, and the volume/speed. This is quite similar to the Model Y, which they stole a lot from. (Copy the homework, but change it up a little). The little screen in front of you while driving is nice because it gives you the speed, turn by turn nav (including Android Auto) and the amount of Charge. It also sending notifications about Bluecruise, with the hands on the wheel in different colors gets your attention easily. You will know when you need to do something and what that is after a while based off the color. Bluecruise being truly hands free opens up your hands to grab some water, or if you are snacking, using both hands to do that. Of course, you do need to be ready to take over if something chaotic happens, so use good judgement here. The car also has wireless Android Auto which has been nice when I am just going around town, since my music autostarts with the map whenever I start the car. One of the downsides about the interior is that Ford used a lot of parts from cheaper cars, making some of the plastics such as the buttons on the steering wheel, the stalks and the Frunk latch feel extremely cheap. Although it doesn’t have the range of the Tesla, or the fast charging of the EV6, it is sufficient of most days, and not painful when you road trip. The nav will auto route you to DC Fast chargers, and often comes up with the same or similar solution to ABRP, but slightly less conservative. If you choose to use Android Auto, you can plug in the route a bit faster just using your phone with ABRP. The trunk space is quite small, maybe bigger than the EV6, but smaller than the Tesla. Using Android Auto also doesn’t allow for battery preconditioning, which is a bummer cause I like those maps more than the Ford Maps.

Out of these three cars, if I had to pick one to live with, it would be the Ford hands down. The integration with Android Auto and Carplay, allows me to pick a destination before I get in the car, get in the car and just send it. I also find it much more normal for the day to day use compared to the Tesla where I would be fiddling with the screen to put in maps or figuring out how to use Spotify if I don’t want to log into Spotify. I think the EV6 is great if you know where you are going every time, but bad if you use Android Auto/Carplay for maps + nav, which is huge for me. Additionally, if I am level 2 charging at home most days, the access to superchargers or the speed at which the car chargers are irrelevant. 90% of the time, I am travelling less than 200 miles in a day, and if I know I am going to exceed that, then I will charge the car close to 100% or find an L2 charger or two in plugshare while running my errands. The speed of charging, and the range past that won’t matter as much as you think if you look for an L2 charger while stopped. As a result of this, I think it is quite funny when reviewers dismiss the Mach E as junk, when in terms of daily usability, I find it much nicer than the alternatives that they offer. I hope that someday soon, I will get the chance to drive an ID4 or BMW/Mercedes so I can add it to this comparison.

&#x200B;

EDIT: I will call out that for the Model Y, I didn't have app access, so I wasn't able to push the routing to the Tesla map, and that it is unfair for me to bash that since I didn't get to try it.

Let me know if y’all have any questions."

Tesla Offers $1,000 To Cybertruck Reservation Holders To Get A Different Tesla
>It’s still clear that there’s a lengthy wait for a Cybertruck. The rear-wheel drive version of Tesla’s pickup won’t be hitting the road until at least 2025, according to the automaker. The RWD Cybertruck is also the most affordable trim, starting at $60,990, and likely has the most reservations.

>It makes financial sense from Tesla’s viewpoint to push tried and true products to the automaker’s most zealous supporters. Those holding reservations might not care about numbers on spreadsheets and the company’s bottom line. Tesla fans could grow frustrated by being encouraged to spend even more money while waiting for the transformational electric pickup they were promised."

2013 Chevy volt ignoring home charger completely. Won’t charge.
Hello, I got a 2013 Chevy volt from Carvana and it was not charged. Guy said he didn’t know it was a plug in. I was able to get the car to charge a little at a public place but was only getting 3 kilowatts so I decided to try at home. I was able to charge a little more using “mountain” mode. I found an outlet outside my house. I plugged the charger in and the green light glows. I plug it into my Chevy and it says “plug in to charge” like the cord isn’t even there. It lets me start the car and potentially drive off and everything. I make sure it clicked and jiggled it some, blew it out with can air duster. Nothing. I contacted Carvana and they said to set up an appointment with one of their partners. I chose Firestone. All I need is a new charger I think. Hope Firestone doesn’t try replacing the whole port or something because I’ve been in a rental for almost a month, almost the whole time the other guy’s insurances gave me. Anyone have issues with a home charger like this?

Edit: Firestone said they won’t even look at my car. So I chatted Carvana giving them a peice of mind, threatening to call BBB and they are gonna cut me a new check for a charger


Edit 2:new charger worked! Eff Carvana! Lol"

F150 Lightning - Thanksgiving Trip Report: Austin to Omaha
**Pre-trip:**

After a successful Texas to [Colorado EV road trip](https://www.reddit.com/r/F150Lightning/comments/15wpuez/2500_mile_trip_report_in_my_lariat_er/) this summer, my wife and I decided to forgo our PHEV Volvo and take the Lightning up to Omaha for Thanksgiving. Although I was a little concerned with the lower temperatures up north, after creating a route in ABRP I was confident the truck would be able to make the trip. With our dog and an 8-month-old along for the ride, the goal of this trip was not to min-max charging and stop time but to simply arrive with all passengers happy and not stranded on the side of the road. We made more stops than if we didn’t have the baby with us and I typically charged the truck to at least 80% instead of leaving once I had the minimum charge needed to reach the next charger. Even with the extra charging time, the truck was usually ready to go before we were. This will probably change once our son is older, but the baby helps mask the Lightning’s longer charging time to 80%. In an ICE, the trip to Omaha from Austin is a 12-hour drive on paper without stops and about 13.5 hours with stops and traffic. In the Lightning, ABRP predicted 16 hours. We opted to break the trip into two days with a stop overnight in Oklahoma City each way.

I purchased a month of EA Pass+ for the discount pricing. It saved me a significant amount of money on my Colorado trip, and I highly recommend you sign up before any road trip you take. Although EA has a reputation of being unreliable/slow, that was not my experience on the last road trip, but I didn’t keep great records of each stop. I felt my experience was too subjective. This time around I kept very detailed records of each charge to better quantify the quality of the DCFC sessions.

**The truck:**

* 2022 Lariat ER
* Cold tire pressure set to 47 psi
* Approximately 500 lbs. of humans, dogs, and cargo
* Tonneau coverage installed over the bed to secure the luggage
* 80% of the frunk was taken up by a stroller which we only used once
* HVAC set to 65F and auto setting 1 the entire trip
* Charged up to 100% with a departure time set for the initial leg of the trip
* I capped my speed at 75 mph but would bump up to 77 mph if I needed a little extra speed to pass. For highways with a speed limit of less than 75 mph, I would drive 2-3 mph over the speed limit.
* I used the Ford Navigation system between DCFCs in order to take advantage of in route pre-conditioning

**Trip summary:**

* 1,928.6 miles travelled (including miles around town in Omaha)
* 1.7 mi/kWh average – Best: 2.3 (Dallas to Denton, TX) – Worst: 1.2 (Blackwell , OK to Wichita, KS)
* 14 DCFC stops during travel, 3 DCFC stops in town, and 2 AC charges in town
* $311.05 spent at EA for 1,064kWh (Average of $0.29/kWh)
* $98.87 saved with a pass+ membership
* $5.99 spent at Chargepoint DCFC for 57kWh (Average of $0.11/kWh)
* $0.62 spent at Chargepoint AC chargers for 14kWh (One session was free – Average of $0.04/kWh)
* $317.66 spent in total for 1,135kWh (Average of $0.28/kWh)
* 5 nights of 120v charging for 64kWh (Nothing is free, but it was free)
* Total time charging during travel: 7 hours and 56 minutes – 213 miles per hour of charging
* Average DCFC time: 34 minutes – Longest: 57 minutes – Shortest: 13 minutes
* Average miles driven between DCFC: 116 – Longest: 160 – Shortest: 65
* Average kWh used: 62 – Max: 100 – Min:41
* Average kWh added: 61 – Max: 105 – Min: 24

Before I move on to the trip report, just for fun, let’s say I drove a Power boost F150 with a 24mpg average and an average fuel price of $2.87

* 1,928.6mi / 24mpg = 80.36 gallons
* 80.36 \* $2.87 = $230.63 fuel cost
* $87.03 more to drive my lightning. This is not surprising with how affordable gas is in Texas, Oklahoma, Kansas, and Nebraska. I didn’t buy this truck to save money on an occasional road trip so no big deal. The savings in fuel are realized when I charge at home. And if we want to get real about “saving”, don’t buy an $80K truck. That’s a different conversation though.

The Trip: I’ll start out with a text narrative of the trip and will follow up with a technical breakdown of each charging stop for those who enjoy that level of detail.

**Austin to Omaha:**

**Day 1:**

We left Austin with a 100% charge and a warm, toasty cabin. The outside temperature was about 50F. Efficiency was great all through Texas, about 2 mi/kWh. We had two charging stops in Texas, Waco (Bellmead) and Denton. The only charging mishap for the day was a mild one. In Denton the charger derated from 160 to 80kW five minutes into the charge. I switched cables on the cabinet and the rest of the session was great maxing at 172kW. We hung around in Denton longer than we normally would to walk over to get some lunch at Chick-Fil-A. This did allow us to charge all the way up to 91%. Once we crossed into Oklahoma, efficiency took a nosedive due to a 15-mph head wind, averaging 1.6 mi/kWh. Despite the low efficiency and because of the high SoC upon departure, we made it all the way up to Oklahoma City where we ended the day with one more charge in Moore before heading to our AirBnB for the night. A few charging observations from the first day: All cabinets were fully operational at all three stations. I had no connection issues. Except for the one temporary derating in Denton, I was getting good speeds. The charging stations were not busy at all, and all chargers were operational, with no indication of reduced speeds.

**Day 2:**

There was a 120v outlet available to use so I was able to charge an additional 10% SoC overnight, leaving with 86% in the morning. After a quick stop at Starbucks, we turned north towards our destination. It was a chilly day starting off in the low 30s and only warmed to about 40F in the afternoon. The headwind woes continued and would gradually get stronger through the remainder of the trip, starting at 14mph in the morning and peaking at 18mph in the afternoon. We averaged a whooping 1.35 mi/kWh! Despite the cold weather and strong winds, we never got into an uncomfortably low SoC situation, but I did get a bit of range anxiety during one of the segments as the GoM and arrival distance were edging towards each other quite quickly. Maybe one day, and I won’t hold my breath, Ford will implement wind speed into its range estimations like Tesla does. We had a total of 4 charging stops this day with one of them being a lower powered 62.5kW ChargePoint unit. We stopped at this site, not because we needed the charge, but because the baby was extremely fussy and needed a 30-minute break. It was also on this day that I started getting the air dam fault message for the first time ever. Not sure if that means the air dam wasn’t working the entire time but it could have contributed towards the lower efficiency. Charging wise, it was a boring day. No connection issues, the chargers were not busy, and I was getting good speeds. In terms of site availability, out of the three EA sites we stopped at, one site had one charger at reduced capacity, and another had one charger out of order. We arrived in Omaha with 22% SoC remaining with a total trip efficiency of 1.5 mi/kWh.

As mentioned in the pre-trip section, ABRP estimated 16 hours of total travel time. The actual total travel time was 17 hours and 15 minutes. Despite the wind and cold, charging speed and efficiency was not the major limiting factor here. I believe we would have been much closer to the estimated 16 hours if it wasn’t for the chick-fil-a side trip in Denton and the unplanned baby meltdown on day two. (We’ve asked him to schedule his meltdowns going forward) ABRP estimated 3 hour and 29 mins of charging. The actual time spent charging was 4 hour and 14 mins.

**Omaha to Austin:**

**Day 1:**

Burr…it was a chilly morning at 27F and it barely got above freezing by the end of the first day. We left our AirBnB where I had been L1 charging during our stay with 81% SoC but stopped at the Council Bluffs, IA EA station on our way out of town just to top up and warm the battery for the 160 mile stretch to Topeka, KS. Efficiency was decent for how cold it was, 1.6 mi/kWh. We made it to Topeka, starting with 84% and ending with 8%. 76% is by far the largest SoC discharge I’ve experienced. I had a slight amount of range anxiety about halfway through but as we got closer it was clear to see the truck was going to make it. South of Topeka the weather took a turn for the worst. At first there was a light snow. Over the next 30 minutes it started snowing much harder and quickly turned into a slush fest on the salty roads. At its worst, visibility got down to about 100m which in all wasn’t that bad. The slippery conditions were what concerned me as the stock AS tires clearly didn’t excel in winter conditions. Every time I switched lanes, I could feel them slightly loosing traction over the line of slush. Early on, BlueCruise continued to work great even when the snow got heavier. Unfortunately, all my sensors were eventually covered in ice, disabling adaptive cruise control. Pretty soon after, conditions got too icy for cruise control, so it didn’t matter anyways, and I opted to drive manually. While I am just a humble, fair weathered Texan, I have been driving up to Omaha for many years and this was far from my first time driving in adverse winter conditions. This was my first time taking an EV though and I made the huge mistake of leaving 1PD driving on. The feeling of letting off the throttle and skidding forward with no traction was not pleasant. 60 miles later and after passing 6 different accidents, we made it to the Wichita EA. The rest of the trip was smooth sailing. The snow quickly turned into rain and my sensors started working again. We made it to our AirBnB in Oklahoma City safe and sound. Charging on day 1 was rather uneventful. We made 4 charging stops, only one site had a broken charger, and I was getting good speeds. I was nervous about it due to being a post-holiday travel day, but I never had to wait to charge. With that said, the Topeka site did fill up with one ID.4 waiting while I was there but the Ionic 5 next to me left soon after allowing them to take the spot.

**Day 2:**

Our AirBnB for the night had a garage but naturally it was about 6” short of being able to fit my truck. Due to this, I was unable to charge the truck overnight, leaving us with an ice-cold battery the next morning. The day started off in the high 20s but eventually warmed up to about 50F as we drove further south. The plan was to charge at the Moore EA station on the way out of town which was a 20-minute drive from the AirBnB. Starting off, the battery temp gauge was slightly to the left of the center line. By the time we arrived, there was just a sliver of space between the bar and the center line. Preconditioning in route seemed to have some effect because the charging speed immediately jumped up to 133kW. Charging wise, this trip was very boring. As with the entire trip, all the EA sites were working beautifully. What was not boring was the heavy traffic. South of Dallas we hit a few patches of slow going, bumper to bumper traffic. BlueCruise worked beautifully here. I set the distance to three bars and let the truck do its thing, keeping me in the lane and maintaining a large gap between us and the car in front. We had a total of three charging stops on this trip. The first two we were able to pull right in and charge. The third and final charge in Waco was a different story. We pull up and every charger was occupied along with 4 EVs already there waiting. There were a group of people standing outside so I went and spoke with them to confirm the line order. Everyone was friendly and despite even more EVs rolling in as we waited, no one tried to cut the line as far as I could tell. We ended up waiting about 20 minutes until it was our turn. We only charged for 15 minutes to create a small buffer and got the heck out of dodge. Another 2 hours of heavy traffic and we were finally home.

ABRP’s estimate of the return trip was 16 hours and 15 minutes. Our actual trip time was 18 hours and 15 minutes. As with the trip to Omaha, charging wasn’t the issue. It was wholly due to the bad weather on day one and heavy traffic on day 2. ABRP estimated 3 hours and 33 minutes of charging time. Our actual charging time was 3 hours and 42 minutes.

**Charging Report:** Below is a detailed charging report for each segment of the trip for those who are into that kind of thing.

**Opinions and Observations:**

* Hands-free BlueCruise is amazing on the open interstate and no other EV outside of the Mach-E provides a true hands-free driving experience. Having to hold, wiggle, or in any way interact with the steering wheel on some regular cadence is not hands-free and I feel like some people don’t appreciate this distinction. Yes, AutoPilot may be more mature and competent, but no, it is not hands-free. I will die on this hill.
* The Lightning may be inefficient, but it has a big enough battery to easily reach the next charger. It has more cargo space than I know what to do with and is unrivaled when it comes to cabin space.
* The Lightning may also not be the fastest charging vehicle available, but I bought it not for the 5% of the year I spend traveling, but for the 95% of the year I’m at home.
* At many charging stops, I repeatedly noticed people struggle to initiate a charge. What this tells me is that the non-Tesla networks are too complicated for the average driver. A universal plug and charge experience is needed before mass adoption can occur.
* I’ve continued to not have issues with EA in my travels, either with charger uptime or speed. Much of my long-distance driving is along the I-35 corridor, so I am fortunate that the EA sites I use have been reliable. I do recognize that not everyone has this experience and it may be geographically dependent.

The electric future is a long, long way off
I don’t think I realized what a big lift it is to switch to electric until I went through the process myself. My house had 150 amp service, and I had to upgrade to 200 amp service to fit in an extra breaker for a wall charger. Then, because of all the weird routing the electricians had to do, the bill to do this upgrade was $8,000. My house was built in the 80s which is probably pretty middle of the road as far as home age goes.

All that to say, this is not affordable for the average American. That $8,000 didn’t even include the cost of the wall charger and related installation. There’s no getting around the fact that most homes will need upgraded service and/or breaker and/or wiring. I’d guess anywhere between $5,000 to $10,000 all in for most homes.

I have no doubt that new construction will start to take this into consideration and build garages with either Nema outlets or chargers. But that’s a tiny fraction of homes in the United States. Not to mention condos and apartments with garages or parking lots. On those properties, you’re at the mercy of your condo association or apartment complex owners.

Maybe some people are comfortable with no home, charging, only charging at public chargers. What do you think? Are the residential upgrades as big barrier as they seem? It seems to me that this is an enormous barrier people on the fence won’t be willing to spend 5 to 10 grand. Even people seriously considering going electric will be put off by it.

I definitely believe that the future is electric and ultimately internal combustion cars will go extinct, at least for new car sales. It’s just that after going through this upgrade, it made me seriously think about how few people will be willing to do it."

I (Bolt owner) rented a Tesla MY for short road trip
I’ve been driving a Chevy Bolt for the past 10 months and have done a couple short road trips (700 miles round trip) and charged at Electrify America on those trips. 

For a recent overnight road trip (300 mi each way), I rented a MY to experience the supercharger network and the MY in general. Below are some observations.

Charging experience - really is flawless. Plug and charge is so great. 

Charging curve - I was a little disappointed in overall charging curve of the Y. I didn’t track it or record it, but a couple of our charging stops ""seemed"" like they were 40+ minutes, but I don't have the exact charging records to confirm. (see ""edit"" portion below for additional context here). 

Efficiency - again, I didn’t track this exactly, but we definitely had to stop for charging more than I thought we would. 

Build quality - I guess I was expecting worse, but it was fine. Ditto with road/wind/cabin noise. Not exactly excessive but you won’t think you’re in a luxury vehicle by any means. 

Acceleration/Torque - very nice and confidence inspiring. 80-95 mph is still effortless when needed. 

Interior - again. It was fine. The spartan interior does feel spartan. Not cheap, per se, but not super premium either. 

Controls - as my first time driving a Tesla, it was always a bit of an adventure trying to navigate the screen. I’m sure once you acclimate, it’s a non-issue. 

Other - the lack of an illuminated cockpit behind the steering wheel was very jarring at night. You end up with this big screen with a very cool color temperature among the void/blackness of the night. It’s not super comforting. I think some additional interior lighting, subtle, could help the interior feel more inviting and comforting at night and perhaps adopting some sort of “true-tone” technology for the screen to warm it up at night. 

In short, the charging experience and network is far superior to the bolt/EA experience, and the car accelerates and handles much better than the bolt, and of course is larger, but I didn’t finish the weekend thinking I need to sell the bolt and buy a MY. Of course it’s what I’m used to, but I think Chevy did a great job with the user experience - some buttons, but not too many, and a great interior for the price.

Edit (updated): for all the replies questioning my charging times, I generally used ABRP to plan my stops and charging times but entered the next supercharger destination into onboard nav so that for most stops (maybe all? I can’t recall), it was pre-conditioned. I did not rent this car to fully “test” the charging capability of the car nor did I track every charging stop with a stopwatch or record start and stop SoC so I may not be recalling all of the charging times accurately. I’m sure others have this very well documented, so if that is your primary interest, I suggest doing additional research. Take my singular experience, as you would any other singular experience, with a grain of salt. All I can say is that it I spent more time waiting in the car for a charge to be finished than I anticipated or expected. Yes, it was way way better than the Bolt, and I may have had unrealistic expectations about what a real DC fast charge should feel like. 

Lastly, I forgot to mention in the original review, the turning radius of the Y isn’t great. The Bolt is better but not great either for its size in my opinion. My 06 Sienna seems to have them both beat.

Edit x 2: In hindsight, I feel really dumb about not trying to search for and enable dark mode on the screen, LOL. In my defense, I only drove in the dark the last hour of my complete road trip. But yeah, that would've made a positive difference."

Tourist charging rental EV in Portugal
Not sure if I just had bad luck or maybe I was poorly prepared ..
Note I’m a 5 year EV driver in US. 
Rented an MG ZS EV with Drivalia. You don’t really know exactly what model they give you until you show up.  They gave me car at 85% charged which seemed fine but.. we shall see this wasn’t. 

Anyway. A2 & A22 traffic was flying, let’s say 80-90mph for a while. Realized the MG range estimator was overly ambitious and my speed had burned a lot of range so I pulled into an IONITY charger at a rest stop with 15% remaining. Was the last rest stop on way on A22 to Algarve. 

Download ionity app. Download miio app. Charger won’t activate. “this charger is not allowing to start charge sessions remotely.”

Spend an hour on ionity phone line across two phone reps. They reboot various chargers. I move car 5 times. They attempt to activate free charge several times until finally works. 

By this point I’m blocking multiple chargers so I could easily try multiple without moving again. Local Portuguese guy pulls up and thinks I’m an idiot. Turns out he can’t charge on first stall he tries either even with his RFID card. I point him to the last charger the reps rebooted for me and that one works. 

Any tips or best practices so I can make it back to Lisbon on the weekend?  Obviously going to have hotel charge me to 100%, drive slower and try chargers earlier on route so I am not at risk of stranding.  Route is only 160mi so disappointing I have to charge at all.

Edit- was actually last rest area on A2, Almodôvar"

In terms of an EV’s center of gravity, will the bulk of its weight still be down low at wheel level when the next generation of battery tech begins replacing lithium ion/iron phosphate?
The potential stats of SSBs are obviously going to be better in terms of energy density, weight and safety, which is great to say the least, but with that I’m left wondering whether or not future EVs with these next-gen batteries will continue to retain of the best highlights they are known for, which is at the start of the title. 

I’m not an EV owner by the way. I’m just a young guy who’s into EV’s who probably won’t be able to afford one in the near future. 😂"

Hertz EV Rental Experience (C40)
As a 1.5 year BEV driver, I needed a rental car in North Carolina and wanted to try an EV rental.

I reserved with Hertz as a Manager’s Special EV rate. There were two levels of MS rates and I took the higher one. The reservation system said they had Bolts, Teslas, Polestars, and EV6s. I was hoping the higher rate would at least keep me out of a Bolt.

As a Hertz Gold member I went right to pickup to get my car. Walking to the assigned space I found – a model that was not even in the online inventory: a Volvo C40.

The car looked close to new. The floor mats, L2charger, and first aid kit were still in the factory plastic in the rear cargo area. There was no cargo cover (I later found it stowed under the cargo tray.)

Inside there was a key fob. There was a hangtag with a QR code explaining how to find chargers and a card with another code for EV guides. The second link only had guides for Tesla and Polestar, so I was on my own. It was not hard to figure out how to start, so no big deal.

The first thing I usually do in a rental is plug in a USB drive with MP3s. When I plugged my drive in the C40 it gave me a “format not supported” error. The drive tested fine in my MME both before and after. Bluetooth connect worked fine so that solved my music source issue. I dug into the menus adjust and sound coming out of the speakers and found out that it only supported a few set patterns of front/back levels.

Back to the center screen, Android Automotive started up with a menu of available options and apps. It was pretty sparse, with only 10 or so options and no charger apps. I got a message asking to connect my Google account and made multiple attempts over the next day, all unsuccessful. I got multiple emails from Google saying they were blocking suspicious access attempts. When I got home I found multiple access requests on my backup phone – none ever came to the main one I was using.

So I was stuck using the stock AAutomotive. I started Maps and put in my destination and it came up with a route. Starting with a 70% charge, it had me stop about 2/3 of the way at a L3 charger. The Google Maps display showed the estimated charge level at my stop and at my final destination.

Pulling out of the space I noticed that the car was in OPD mode. I’m not a fan but it was not hard to find the setting to turn it off. I don’t want to think how an inexperienced EV driver would have reacted.

Checking out I asked about “Charge Purchase Option.” It’d like buying the gas in the tank for an ICE rental, only the Hertz site didn’t have any explanation. Essentially how it works is you get three options: bring the car back with at least a 70% charge, bring it back lower and pay a $35 charge fee, or just pay the $35 up front if you know you’re going to use it. The last one is the Charge Purchase Option. Also, there would have been another $25 fee if I returned it with a charge under 10%.

On the road now I could start to get the feel of the car. It was very responsive and comfortable. I also liked the size. I think a lot of EVs are unnecessarily large (including the EV6 and MME I own/ed.) I did not like the restricted rear view due to the narrowing at the back.

On the open highway I turned on the adaptive cruise. Two things annoyed me. First, the ACC display icons were clustered at the bottom center of the driver display, making it hard to see them around the steering wheel. Second, after the speed is set, pressing +/- moves the set speed by a multiple of 5 mph. So if you’re initially set to 62 and plus up, it will go to 65, then 70. The only way to set it to 68 was to be at that speed and reset. 

One other issue was the lack of brake hold. I found out later it's only available with OPD.

Looking back at AAutomotive, I was unable to find a way to get Maps to display anything less than full screen. No tiled areas with music info like the last two versions of AAuto. Also, it stayed locked at a resolution that showed the current location and destination. It did not zoom in closer when approaching intersections, which meant I had to pay close attention to street signs or quickly learn how to estimate 600 feet.

I made it easily to the designated L3 charger. It was a Shell Recharge location, but its stickers still said Greenlots and the QR code went to a dead link. After loading the app and adding a prepaid balance (GRR). Starting out at around 35% charge, the driver display showed the charge rate quickly jump to around 240 kWh. It slowed down after, resulting in an average charge rate of about 80 kWh (25.45 kWh delivered over a little less than 20 minutes.)

I got to my hotel and plugged in for the evening. The center charge display had options to preset the charge level. I set it to 90 and was told it would be done by 11:00. Of course, without access to an app I had no way to check on progress aside from going back top the car, so I just left it there for the night.

The next morning I went out to move the car off the charger. I did that and went hunting through the options to see if there were any driving or charging logs, but didn’t find any (they could only work with linked accounts.) I also got a message that the car wanted to install an update that would take 1.5 hours to complete. I wasn’t using the car the rest of the day but didn’t want to take the chance of having an issue and needing help from the Hertz two hours away.

I used it for a few short trips over three days and everything went smoothly. The evening before returning I put it up to charge again and set the level to 100%. When I took it off, the GOM estimated the range at 220 miles. When I put in the airport destination the next morning AAutomotive said I should arrive without charging with a level of 38%. I did a bit better than that and pulled in to the return lot with 42% left.

Bottom lines:

C40: Not bad but more minuses than plusses. I’d rent one again in a pinch but wouldn’t buy one.

AAutomotive: I’m sure there are things I missed either because of not being able to link or settings being locked down for a rental. Even so, if I have a choice I won’t be trading the real time charge info in maps to get a less useful experience on the display.

Overall rental experience was positive, but I honestly don’t want to think how an ICE driver who was given this car unexpectedly would have fared."

EA PUT ME IN DANGER & WONT LET ME CHARGE BC I HAVE LESS THAN $10 IN MY ACCOUNT
I’m at the charging station. I have $5 in my account and cannot get where I’m going. I was informed to find a ride if I break down on the side of the road bc she is “not allowed” to start a charge if the account has LESS THAN $10 inside. Last I checked I put that money in to that account. Not them. So I should be able to use every penny I have in that account. 

So basically they are stealing our money and will not let us use what we have. I have a 2017 Kia Soul. It takes maybe $5 for a full charge. And I can’t charge my car bc I have $4.64 in my EA account? Thank you Electrify America for putting me at risk of being kidnapped, having heat stroke, etc. 
I will NEVER touch an EA charger again. Electrify America, I’m blasting you EVERYWHERE!!!

I want my $4.64 in a check since you won’t let me use it on my car and I’m currently drowsing in the heat scared for my life bc of your company."

I get why people say to buy Tesla for the charging network now
I have a MYLR. This weekend we took a short trip up to the mountains (Salida, CO) for kicks.

We were in downtown Salida and needed a charge before heading up the road to Buena Vista, and the one supercharger up there is a bit inconveniently placed ands is only 150kw, so I thought we’d stop at the chargepoint DCFC station on the other side of town. I thought PlugShare had it at 250kw.  

We get there and one stall is down, we got lucky that no one else was there. So I grab my trusty CCS combo adaptor, and tap my Apple Pay on the tap logo. 

Oh, gotta download the app and make an account. Ok. I do all that. It offers Apple Pay as the payment method in the app. All set. Activate the charger (which is only 150kw), plug in, and…. I’m getting 14kw. No bueno. Maybe something isn’t seated correctly. Stop the charge and try again, only this time the charger won’t start again. Eventually I give up and drive to the super charger. 

While charging, I got an email from chargepoint that my charging was suspended due to no payment method, and I owe them $.20. No wonder things errored out after I stopped the first charge. Apple Pay won’t work in the app to pay my balance. I give up. 

Now, I’ve tested my adaptors at stations close to my home, and my CCS adaptor got 250kw at an EA station which worked after a bit of fiddling. 

I can’t believe how fiddly and annoying charging can be outside of the supercharger network now that I’ve lived it. How does anyone deal with this? I trust my car on road trips; not sure I’d be able to trust a different make. These things need to improve NOW."

Scammy charger companies
To preface this- 99% of the time we charge at home. The handful of times I’ve charged on a trip I’ve used EA with plug and charge and it’s always worked fine. No fuss. 

This trip I used two other brand chargers and the way they run their app and charges pisses me off. First one is the hotel we stayed at had two SemaConnect L2 chargers. No credit card readers so you have to use their app to activate the charging session. It was fairly straight forward to get charging started but instead of just charging me for what I use they automatically load $20 at a time into my “account” so now I have extra money sitting in this app that I likely won’t use again. It’s borderline scammy business practice. 

The second charger I used was a L3 ChargePoint that was in a parking lot of a restaurant we ate at so I figured why not. Same thing where I had to use the app to activate it. Charging starts fine but once again I find that they load $10 at a time into my “account” and I’m left with a credit that I probably won’t ever use again, or at least won’t use for a long time. 

Why is this a thing and why do these companies think this is a good business practice? Going forward I’m avoiding these chargers unless I absolutely need to use them."

One-pedal should be sold as a major ease of driving advantage
Bolt one-pedal driving UI is sadly apologetic. First was called “L” as a copy of low gear. Required two shift lever pulls, so olds won’t use it. Asking olds to double-pull the shifter is like asking them right-click.

The update got a baffling icon which shows one-pedal as regen / efficiency. But it should just be the default drive mode, which should just be a “go” icon, a car with a forward arrow.

It is at least on a single-press button, and stays on across starts. 

If Apple did one-pedal, it would be on by default, they’d sell it like the major simplicity fix it is, and they’d have a user mandate. Not this Mickey Mouse stuff.

EV marketing should pitch one-pedal as simplicity / ease, then extended range.

Bolt actually does it well vs., e.g., VW. Make “the simplest driving, the best range” a major selling point.

Transport methods
I actually live in an urban environment and close enough to my job where I should be able to use something other than my gasoline car which has been expensive. I’d like to keep miles off it and enjoy a different way of commuting. However, I’m having a hard time trying to do so. 

Public transport doesn’t run during the hours I commute, and even if it did, it would take like an hour to get to my destination 5 miles to my job. Until conventional electric cars start trickling into the used car market and can prove to be reliable enough when that old, buying brand new isn’t an option right now. 

Next, electric bikes are in a gray area since the municipal considers them a motorized vehicle like a scooter or motorcycle, you can’t use them in bike paths or sidewalks, but the dmv won’t let you register them for road use either. 

Lastly I’ve been looking into low speed vehicles which aren’t legal to operate on the roads I’d need to take to get to work since the speed limit on some of them are over 35mph, and those electric microcars from alibaba aren’t legal to operate on public roads anyway. At least around me

So…besides walking and analog bicycle, what’s left? America wants to get us using alternate forms of transport, yet make it impossible to do so."

Previously I posted about needing a PHEV for road trips, but I was seduced by the appearance of the Ioniq 5. After taking multiple road trips in my SE RWD, here are 10 things I think everyone should consider before switching to a BEV for road trips.
Background info

My wife and I were looking to replace her 2016 Nissan Sentra with an SUV as she wanted more space for our frequent road trips from San Antonio to Louisiana. Since her vehicle would be the long distance one, we were looking into PHEVs that way I could get a BEV in 5 years when it’s time to replace my car, and hopefully in 10 years when it’s time to replace her car, we would go full BEV when the technology caught up. I made [this post](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/u9hhxo/has_anyone_had_recent_success_getting_a_new_phev/) asking about MSRP dealers for PHEVs and got inundated with comments saying to just buy a BEV. After hours arguing with people about it, u/weldae left [this](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/u9hhxo/comment/i5rxmpa/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3) comment that caught my attention as it seemed to indicate the Ioniq 5 would make the trip faster than a Tesla Model 3. That didn’t seem right to me, so I looked it up and saw the car for the first time. It was more than what we wanted to spend, but holy cow was it gorgeous. My wife, who always said it’s stupid to care about what your car looks like since you’ll be sitting inside it, immediately declared that she wanted it without knowing anything about it. After a week of researching, comparing it to the EV6 and other EVs, we went ahead and bought an SE RWD. To be clear, if there was a PHEV version of the I5, we would have gotten that instead. But regardless, after over a month and over 3,000 miles, here are 10 things to consider before buying a BEV for road trips.

#1. My actual road trip range is less than half of the listed 300 miles

The EPA estimated range of the Ioniq 5 RWD is 303 miles, but this drops significantly on the highway. Driving around 80mph, my efficiency is around 2.4mi/kWh (u/Willman3755 did a fantastic [roll-down test](https://www.reddit.com/r/electricvehicles/comments/u8enlo/i\_did\_rolldown\_testing\_on\_the\_ioniq\_5\_to\_create/?utm\_source=share&utm\_medium=ios\_app&utm\_name=iossmf) with an Ioniq 5 AWD and my real-world experience in my RWD has matched his results extremely closely.) On a 77.4kWh battery, that’s only around 186 miles. And that’s from 100% to 0. On a road trip, you’re typically limited to using about 70% of your battery (the 10-80%) as your charging speed drops significantly past 80%. So that 186 miles is really about 130 miles between stops. And that’s assuming there’s a charger at that distance. My route has chargers spaced roughly 60 miles apart. Despite the 300 mile listed range, my car can’t really make it to a charger 180 miles away, so I’m stuck stopping every 120 miles or so. At 80 mph, that’s a stop every hour and a half. Keep in mind, this is in the south, where temperatures have been warm, so I’m not losing any range for the cold. Just a bit for the A/C.

It’s about 480 miles from Baton Rouge, LA to our house in San Antonio, TX and we make this drive pretty frequently. A person brand new to BEVs might look at the I5’s 300 mile range and expect to be able to make the trip with just one stop about the halfway point. But this is what my most recent trip was actually like.

55 miles to first stop in Lafayette to charge from 14%-74% (there are no DCFCs in BR so we started with about 40% SoC): 19 minutes total (16 minutes charging, plus 3 minutes to switch chargers as the first was only giving 100kw. 

120 miles to 2nd stop in Vidor to charge from 7%-66% (Every stop this trip, the speed dropped to 30kw after adding about 59% to the battery): 14 minutes total

12 miles to 3rd stop for Fuzzy’s Tacos: 3 minutes total

75 miles to 4th stop in Houston to charge from 13%-72%: Total time 16 minutes

40 miles to 5th stop in Katy to charge from 54%-83% (This was the last known working EA station on our route home, so we needed to stop here in case the one in Columbus was out): 14 minutes as we only got 100kw speeds

45 miles to 6th stop in Columbus to charge from 58%-81%: Total time 20 minutes. Only two stations of the 4 were working, so we wasted time trying the two broken ones, and a Kona was using the 350kw, so we were stuck with 150kw. Mainly happy that it worked at all.

140 miles to home and arrived with 3% battery after dropping speeds for the last 70 miles.

A trip that normally takes about 6.5 hours including gas, food, and restroom stops took us about 8 hours despite the good charging speeds. And that still beat the ABRP estimate. Keep in mind the charging stop times do not include time to actually get to the chargers which are further off the road than typical gas stations.

#2. Highway efficiency is as important as range and charging speeds for road trips. Knowing your car’s miles/minute charge rate is more important than its kw rate.

Let’s say you routinely take 1200 mile road trips and you’re looking at two BEVs.

Car A: 200 mile highway range using 70% of the battery. Average charging speed 200kw. 70% battery capacity 125kWH

Car B: 150 mile highway range (at 70%). Avg charging speed 150kw. 70% battery capacity 50kWH.

On the surface, Car A looks like the clear winner. Longer range, faster charging speed, bigger battery. But Car B has the significant advantage of highway efficiency, getting 3mi/kWh vs Car A’s 1.6mi/kWh. This means that Car A only charges at a rate of 5.33 miles/min while Car B charges at 7.5 miles/min. Car A would need to stop 5 times to charge for 37.5 minutes each for a total of 187.5 minutes while Car B would need to stop 7 times to charge for 20 minutes each for a total of 140 minutes. Even if we add 10 minutes extra for each stop, Car B would make the trip faster by about half an hour. Make sure to verify your car’s highway efficiency numbers when looking for a road trip BEV.

A car like the 2020 Ioniq isn’t seen as a great road tripper due to the 170 mile range and 50kw charging speed. But with a tested highway efficiency of 4.5mi/kWh, its highway range doesn’t fall off a cliff like many cars and it has the added bonus of being able to maintain its miles/minute charge rate using any DCFC 50kw and up. You can regain about 120 miles of range in 30 minutes. The upcoming Silverado EV claims 400 mile range with a 200kWh battery. If its highway efficiency is actually 1.5mi/kWh (very possible considering the enormous battery size), then it’s actual highway range at 70% would be 210 miles. If you get stuck on a 150kw charger (see number 7), and you’re only charging at a rate of 160kw, it would take you about 30 minutes to recoup 120 miles of range, about the same as the Ioniq. That’s not to say that the Ioniq is as good of a road tripper as the Silverado, but the real-world difference might not be as much as you think. Especially considering the Ioniq’s mile/min charge rate would be triple the Silverado’s if they’re both at a 50kw.

#3. EV charge stations are pretty terrible compared to gas stations

Most aren’t covered, so you get soaked in the rain and baked in the sun. They aren’t pull-through like gas stations so it’s often pretty awkward getting your car oriented to charge. Not only do I have to back in (which is not that simple with some Walmart parking lots being one-ways with the parking spots meant to be driven in forward), I have to hope that the charger is on my passenger side for the stations that aren’t right behind you. For [my first ever charge](https://imgur.com/a/OJluUg1) I had to park in a spot that wasn’t even technically for EVs just to get the charger to reach. Or just [look at how this car had to park](https://imgur.com/a/AujnY7s) to access this station. Now imagine if there were other cars parked in the other stations already. Since the cables are often pretty short, you’re basically out of luck. I have no idea how people with trailers are supposed to charge at most of these stations. Plus, I’ve never needed a Shell or Exxon app to refuel my car, but I now have to have apps for all of the different charge stations that I use. I’ve seen several new owners on the phone with others trying to get help with getting the station to work. And that’s not even mentioning how often a station is randomly down or has slow speeds with no warning. Additionally, I feel significantly less safe at EV stations than at gas stations. If I pull up to a gas station at night and there’s sketchy characters around, I can just drive to another nearby. If I pull up to a EV station in the dark corner of a Walmart parking lot at night, I don’t have much choice but to plug in and hope for the best. Not only am I stuck there for significantly longer than a gas station, I also don’t have the option of just driving away if someone is approaching who looks like they have bad intentions. If the car is plugged in, it literally cannot start. And there is no Ejecto Chargo button to try and get away. You’re a sitting duck. And since EVs are still pretty expensive, this may become an obvious target for people looking to make an easy score. Unlike most gas stations which tend to be open 24 hours, most Walmarts are closed overnights, so that 2am charge becomes even less comfortable. 

#4. Road tripping an EV can be more expensive than gas

This greatly depends on your car and where you’re road tripping, but in general, DC fast charging isn’t much cheaper than gas. Electrify America charges $0.43/kWh. At 2.4mi/kWh, it costs about $0.18 per mile to road trip an Ioniq 5. My Ford Fusion Hybrid gets 40mpg at 80mph. Gas prices in my area are around $4.40, meaning the Fusion costs about $0.11 per mile. The Ioniq 5 is about 60% more expensive. There’s a $4 a month subscription to bring the price down a bit, but I’d need to drive about 1000 miles a year to break even, and then after the discount I’m still paying $0.13 per mile. Obviously, this depends heavily on several factors, including the car’s efficiency, gas prices in the area, charging prices in the area (Texas and Louisiana charge by the minute, so the Ioniq 5 is actually significantly cheaper on my route), and any possibly incentives like the free charging for 2 years that we got with the purchase. But it’s an important consideration when calculating the cost savings of an EV. If you’re comparing a BEV with a hybrid or PHEV, your gas savings may not be as much as you expect if a significant portion of your miles come from road trips. 

#5. Even if charging an EV was as fast as filling a gas car, many EV road trips would still take longer

There are DCFCs along most major interstates, but the fastest routes aren’t always along those interstates. For example, when visiting Baton Rouge from San Antonio, we typically stop off in Opelousas to visit some family. It is significantly faster to take 190 after Lake Charles and then stay on 190 into Baton Rouge. Instead, we now have to go out of our way to Lafayette to charge before going to Opelousas, and then back to Lafayette after leaving Opelousas to charge again because Baton Rouge does not have a single DCFC. This problem is exacerbated when travelling from Dallas to Opelousas as the fastest route through Shreveport is impossible with the current charging infrastructure. This means we have to take a route 2 hours slower just to not be stranded.  Combine this with the previous detour and we’re easily adding 5 hours to a round trip without even factoring in charging time. I know a lot of people in this sub think the real road trip isn’t the destination but is actually the Walmarts you meet along the way, but for frequent, repetitive road trips that don’t have good scenery, this is a lot of extra time in the car. 

When comparing travel times, always make sure to put in a round trip to ABRP with the start and end destination at your house and a waypoint at your actual destination. This ensures that you’re factoring in time to charge for the way home as well. Also make sure to check the travel time vs Google Maps. A round trip from San Antonio to Denver is around 27 hours in Google Maps, but 34 hours with ABRP. Only 3.5 of the 7 hour difference is charge time. The other 3.5 hours is due to the slow driving needed just to make it to the chargers. You need more than just time spent charging to calculate the true time loss of road tripping a BEV.

#6. There are some places that you may not be able to go

Charging infrastructure is improving, but there’s still a long way to go. My wife was considering taking our niece to South Padre Island, so she plugged in a round trip from San Antonio into ABRP. No valid routes. We looked at Plugshare and confirmed that it simply wasn’t realistic to try and make it there and back in her car without putting ourselves in some sketchy situations. In your area this may be a non-issue, but there are still many rural places that an EV can’t get you just yet.

#7. Assume you’ll be charging at 150kw, even if your car can take more. You’re more likely to be “ICEd” by an EV.

Every EA station on my route has 4-6 stations with only a maximum of 2 being 350kw. And you can almost guarantee that if people are there, they’re going to be using the 350s. I’ve already had many instances of being stuck on 150kw charger become some Bolt or ID.4 was taking the 350kw charger for no apparent reason. I’ve seen a Polestar roll up to a site with 5 empty stations and still plug in to the one with a Chademo because forget Leaf owners I guess. And I’ve already seen multiple instances of L2 chargers being blocked by Teslas that aren’t even plugged in. There’s a good chance that if a charger you need is being blocked, it will be another EV doing it. With gas, if someone is blocking a station, you just pull into one of the other 16 at that gas station, or just go to another if they’re all full. Personally, I would like to see an additional fee get added to 350kw stations. Maybe $0.05 per minute. That way cars that can’t benefit from the extra speed of the 350s have an incentive not to use them. 

#8. Be prepared for the possibility of long lines at charging stations during an upcoming holiday season

Obviously nobody can predict the future, but as many in this sub point out, EV adoption is picking up extremely quickly. Currently there are only 3 CCS DCFC sites with 150kw units in the entire state of Louisiana. EA currently doesn’t show any plans to add additional chargers in Louisiana on I-10, so those 3 sites will need to serve all of the traffic passing through Louisiana for the foreseeable future. 2 of the 3 sites only have 4 stations. Let’s assume the average car takes 30 minutes to charge (some are faster, but some are slower and since it may be cold during Christmas, 30 minutes is actually being generous). This means a site with 4 stations can only charge 8 cars per hour. With the increased non-Tesla EV sales, the reduced range and increased charge times during the winter, and the increase in traffic during the holiday seasons, it’s entirely possible that sites could face a bottleneck where the rate of cars needing to charge surpasses the capacity of the site. Especially considering these sites have to serve traffic travelling in both directions and you can’t exactly just go to another if the site is full. If over a 10 hour period, a 4 station site gets 10 cars per hour, you’re looking at a 2.5 hour backlog. I’m already seeing photos spread around this sub of full charging stations. Will this be an issue this year? Maybe not. But it could pose serious problems in 2023 or even 2024. Many MV electrical distribution equipment have 18-24 month lead times, so if adding more sites to a route isn’t already in EA’s plan, there’s a good chance it won’t happen until 2025 at the earliest. I’m an electrical engineer currently working on a project that involves installing [battery electric locomotives](https://www.up.com/media/releases/battery-electric-locomotive-nr-220128.htm) for a rail company and we’re targeting an end of 2024 completion date partially due to long equipment lead times. If the utility needs to make substation improvements, it could be even longer. EA may have deals in place that allow them to acquire the necessary equipment more quickly, but if adding more sites in a particular area isn’t already in the works, I wouldn’t expect to see it happen for quite awhile.

#9. Your car’s needs now have to be factored into your plans

I’m sure there were a few people who read the paragraph about needing 6 stops and wondered why I didn’t just get food during one of the stops or pick out a hotel that had EV charging so we didn’t have to leave at 40% SoC. The simple answer is that we have already established hotels and food places that we like for this trip. Many EV owners just take it as a given that they’re going to choose whatever hotel in the area has charging or that they can just eat whatever is close while the car is charging. But I don’t want my car’s needs dictating where I stay or what I eat. It already dictates where I stop. In all my years of travelling this stretch I would never voluntarily stop in Vidor, TX for example, but the car doesn’t give you many options. Not a huge deal, but something to consider. 

#10. Extra passengers impact range and efficiency

I realize initial reactions to this may be “well duh” but impacting range and efficiency is a bigger deal in an EV than a gas car. I can drive about 540 miles on a tank in my Fusion Hybrid, so losing 10% for adding a passenger doesn’t change much. I’m still stopping for gas only once during the 480 mile trip. We averaged 2.4mi/kWh on our recent trip to Baton Rouge, but only 2.1mi/kWh on the trip back despite driving around the same speeds. Certainly, the wind or battery temperature could have had an impact, but I believe the major difference was that we added my niece as well as her luggage. When looking at range and 70mph tests, keep in mind they’re usually done with one driver and no luggage. If you’re road tripping with a family and a bunch of gear, you may see some significant drop-offs in efficiency. I don’t know the exact effects, but I would love to see some studies on it. 

#Bonus for Ioniq 5 shoppers: AWD and RWD get essentially the same range

You may have figured this out after number 1, but there is essentially no difference between the road trip range of a RWD and AWD I5 despite the 50 mile gap in the EPA range. My real-world experience has lined up with previous AWD tests including the InsideEvs and Out of Spec 70mph range tests. An AWD that’s driving in Eco is only using RWD, so you get almost the same range. The only difference is the slight weight difference of the front motor which is the rough equivalent of having an extra passenger. The large difference in the EPA range is due to the testing using Normal mode which utilizes AWD. So if you want an AWD, don’t worry about the range difference as long as you drive in Eco on the highway. You can still enjoy the benefits of AWD in the city. 

#Would I still buy this car if I could do it over?

Honestly, I absolute would. It’s possible that I’m still simply infatuated with the Ioniq 5 and my opinion will change in time. But as of now, I’d still much rather do an 8 hour road trip in the I5 than a 6.5 hour trip in an ICE. The quiet, comfortable, roomy ride, plus the instant torque and the ability to silently pass people before they can speed up to block you make it worth the extra time for me. I pointed out the frequent stops before, but it really helps to break up the drive so you’re not sitting in a car for hours and hours on end. Instead of one long trip, it feels more like 5 short trips. No sore butt, no back pain, no avoiding drinking so you don’t have to use the restroom. Yes, I could switch back to a gas car and just start taking breaks, but it’s a huge mental hurdle as it then feels like I’m wasting time when I could be driving. With the EV, you’re not fighting the urge to just keep pushing to get it over with. Speeding along from charger to charger is honestly fun and I have no idea when that’s going to stop being the case. Not to mention the I5 has regen paddles that let you control the regen levels, which make driving much more fun. If I’m going 100 and I see traffic ahead going 70, I can take my foot off the gas to start coasting down to the 90s. If I’m still too fast I go to Level 1 regen, still too fast and I click again to go to Level 2. It’s a constant game of how far can I go while not having to touch the gas or brake pedal. It’s honestly pretty difficult to go back to driving my Fusion after driving the I5, but the current plan is still to keep it for another 5 years…unless I stumble across a good deal for a 2017 Ioniq Electric. The point of the post isn’t to discourage anyone from getting an EV, but just to provide some additional perspective that a lot of BEVangelicals in this sub often leave out."

Trip planning help
Hi all - thanks in advance. Having major range anxiety for my first long road trip in an EV and would appreciate advice.

I’m driving from Denver, CO to the Gorge amphitheater in July. I’ve used ABRP and basically plotted each of four legs of the trip using two different settings for how frequent to stop (the “medium” and the second to “most frequent”).

Basically I’m trying to avoid getting too low on the battery for certain runs between charges. I also am staying at a hotel that has a slow L2 charger so won’t be able to get there with 10% and charge to 90% overnight, so I’ve manually modified the next starting SOC to reflect that.

Given some runs I’m more confident about, I’m planning to paste all of the (8 total) routes planned into Excel then pick and choose chargers that seem to fit my comfort level.

Then I’m going to use plugshare/aeon charge and make sure the relevant chargers are operational before embarking.

Just curious if there is any easier way to do this. This seems super cumbersome and is taking forever. Or is this just the nature of the current state of EV road trip planning?

For reference: I have a Rivian R1T and the on board navigation does not give me enough confidence to do the trip using just that.

Thanks again"

Any advice?
I recently put a deposit down to order an Ioniq 5, but like many others, found out I likely won’t receive it for quite some time.  I have an opportunity to buy a used 2021 Mach-E California Route 1 with around 20,000km’s on it, but it’ll cost about $7-8000 more than we were planning on paying. The dealership says that we can sell it back to them when our Ioniq 5 order comes in.   This would be our first EV purchase, so I’m eager to buy now instead of just waiting another year or two to start driving one.  But will we be losing much money in the end if we sell the Mach-e back and take on the Ioniq 5? I will likely put on approx 25,000 km’s over a year. 
Our estimate for the Ioniq 5 was going to cost approx $60k total CAD. The Mach-E will cost closer to $68k CAD after taxes. 
What would you do?

Electric Vehicle PSA
The general public lacks some important information on how electric vehicles behave on the road. Here are some basics. 

1. Most EVs have a varying degree of regenerative breaking when not engaging ‘gas’ pedal. This means that you can go from accelerating to breaking in an instant. This can come as a surprise to the car following as this abrupt breaking behavior is not typical in gas powered cars. Most new EVs have break lights engage when a level of regenerative breaking is applied. Use caution when closely following an EV for instance in city driving. 

2. This should be #1 but everyone needs to be aware that Electric cars can be insanely fast. And they’re silent. A powerful EV has all torque available all the time so these cars can launch from a stop like a Porsche in launch mode. I’m horrified that kids and bad drivers will have this sort of speed available. And again you won’t hear a Tesla that’s as fast as Ferrari, we’re accustomed to hearing a car accelerating hard and we had that audible warning, there won’t even be much tire spin noise since they’re mostly 4wd. 

3. Yet again, these cars are silent my friends. That means you won’t hear them turn on or move in a parking lot, the cars just start to move. I live in a big city and an EV will pull out of an alleyway and I was always surprised because I didn’t hear it coming just feet away. So, in general you need to trust your ears less and rely on your eyes more. I think we need a louder reverse beeping noise on all EVs."

Is the 2016 Kia Soul EV+ a good option?
I found a used Kia Soul EV+ with 38,000 miles. Dealer wants about $17,000 firm. The interior looks just as new so I’m assuming the previous owner took good care of it. One owner and no accidents reported. I drive about 60-65 miles a day so it would be perfect for me since it’s only driving around town. However, I am a little skeptical about the battery capacity and degradation since it’s 6 years old. Is it a good choice? Has anyone owned the same model? Will the car last at least 100,000 miles before the battery starts losing capacity? The dealer won’t check the battery capacity using an OBD. They showed the screen and it says 100% capacity with 93 miles remaining. I have until tomorrow morning to sign the contract. Am I going to regret this decision?"

Need help, pls read!
Hi! I have a Fiat 500e and somethings off…
In October the battery got damaged bc the car was in a flood and reportedly had a hole in the battery, and the water entered the battery. We ordered a new one and changed it and the car was OK. 
Last night, my brother was driving it and it was raining, there wasn’t any major flooding, just raining, arrived home, plugged in the car and everything was fine. This morning the car won’t start and we don’t understand why. The first time it happened the car was still starting but not driving, now it won’t start + it had a brand new battery and we did nothing wrong, like we can’t find any reason why this happened. Does someone have any idea ??

**update: the car turned one and it’s charging. Now it has some problems with the AC, and the car guide"

Tried (unsuccessfully)to buy an ioniq5 :(
I’ve been looking to replace my 2019 leaf with something that has longer range and had been anticipating the ioniq 5 because it looks so cool!

I was pretty excited when the dealers around me (Southern California) started getting them, but I went to try to buy one today and found them marked up $8500 :( 

Prob the biggest selling point in the ioniq5 vs model y debate for me was the price, but with the markup they’re basically the same price…

Just my rant. I think the dealers have outlived their usefulness

Edit: since some people were wondering, the dealer was Norm Reeves in Cerritos. Since talking to them they’ve been texting me to come in and “work with them” when I said that I don’t want to pay over msrp they told me I won’t find one not marked up for over a year, so they hope I’m prepared to wait.

ID.4 test drive, terrible dealer experience
Figured I would share my terrible dealer experience test driving an ID.4 recently: 

I go to the VW dealer after already having set up an ID.4 test drive days in advance. Salesmen and myself both get in the car to start drive and first thing I do is try to turn on A/C as its a little hot out. Entire climate control screen won’t work and says something like “system unavailable” on screen. Salesmen says that it will work once “the cars warms up.” I go along with it even though I know that doesn’t makes sense. 

Halfway through the test drive I start talking about the Electrify America charging network as one of my concerns versus Tesla’s supercharger network for road trips. The salesmen responds that he isn’t really sold on EVs for road tripping yet himself and wouldn’t want to deal with chargers for road trips...

As we finish the drive of course the climate control is still broken. By this time it had gotten noticeably warm in the car. As I park the vehicle, I ask salesmen if the ID.4 has a frunk (I already know it doesn’t) and he responds “yeah it has some storage up there, let me open it for you” He then opens the hood and is surprised to see nothing. 

Salesmen finally has me come into his office to continue “talking” even though entire ID.4 ordering process is done by the individual online like any EV these days. I mention how I’m considering Model Y as my top choice right now and salesmen immediately goes on a rant how Volkswagen quality is better than Tesla. I guess he forgot that a major component of the ID.4 we had just driven didn't work at all. 

It continues to blow my mind how out of touch regular dealers & salesmen are with EV’s. I’ve done multiple Tesla and even Polestar test drives for comparison and their sales advisors have been very knowledgeable and entire drive experience amazing in comparison. 

How any legacy auto maker selling in the U.S. expects to catch Tesla with sales models like what I experienced with VW is beyond me. End rant ."

Prospects for BBB?
Does anyone have any insight into the likelihood of the new EV tax credit actually going into effect next year? I ask because I think I am about to be offered a job with about a 140-mile round-trip commute, and I won’t be able to afford to drive my 2011 Sedona that much.

Our impressions (and decisions) after test driving the ID4, Ioniq 5, and the Tesla Model Y
Update 25/9/22; We received the Model Y LR on 16/9/22. I've put some updates in through the text based on my experiences so far.

TL;DR: Tried the ID4, Ioniq 5 2WD, and Model Y LR. Settled on the Model Y because it:

* offered the most usable space distribution & format of the three
* had the most range and efficiency of the three (and included a heat pump, which really should be standard in all EVs in that price class)
* felt the nicest to drive despite the bumpy suspension; the one-pedal driving was notably smoother (especially compared to the rather jerky Ioniq 5)
* had a much better software experience (compared to the almost unusable system in the ID4 & the rather cluttered UI of the Ioniq) albeit with some notable frustrations \[UPDATE: Tesla was on the final iteration of the v10 UI at the time of this writing - v11 as a first impression, based on what I have read and seen so far, might have left just as bad as an impression as the other two cars\],
* benefits from the supercharger network for which we don’t need membership cards or any such nonsense; we can simply plug and go.

We are in the market for an EV. We will use the car that we buy so long as it can be used, and we have a specific set of priorities. We test drove three cars over the past month. I’m posting my impressions not just in the hope that it might help someone else out (like reading so many of your posts has helped me out), but also to consolidate my thoughts and perhaps even get some additional perspectives/opinions/insights. I may edit this to add / clarify things as I go along. This is an extremely long, potentially rambly post; you have been warned.

# Budget:

We are in Austria; our budget is capped at €60,000 including:

* The car plus any addons/
* Incentives (€5,000 from the country, €2,000 from the state we are in)
* Registration costs & related overheads (estimating these at €1,500ish)
* A home charging station (assuming this to be €1,000ish)
* One year of comprehensive insurance (estimating this at €2,000ish; it’s essential for financing)

# Priorities:

The most important requirement is space & practicality. Our bare minimum expectation is that the car must comfortably fit two to three adults, one (yet to come) medium sized dog (25 – 35 kg) with its crate, and luggage for a week-long trip. Ideally, we would like the car to up to fit four adults, up to two dogs, and luggage (which may or may not include ski-gear; we will get a roof rack, naturally). This car will be used for hauling stuff, people, pets, and any combination thereof.

Range, efficiency & charging possibilities are next. I don’t necessarily have “range anxiety” and I certainly don’t intend to drive 600 km in one stretch on the regular; I usually take a break every 200 to 300 km and stopping periodically will be normal once we start travelling with a dog anyway. That said, I have read that EVs take a significant range hit in the winter and range isn’t something I want to have on my mind if we go on a ski-trip. Having an efficient car with a good HVAC (and a heat pump) should theoretically help ease any winter range trouble.

I have also read horror stories about the charging infrastructure here. I don’t want to find myself in a situation where I need to charge and either nothing works because the provider doesn’t give a shit, or I can’t use the charger because I don’t have a specific membership card. This is especially worrisome when I think about driving internationally. Despite Austria having a relatively well-developed infrastructure, things are the way they are, and there still are parts of the country that are devoid of chargers; from what I’ve read, many other countries are farther behind. Sure, the situation will only get better with time, but I can only gauge based on what I see today.

Which leads perfectly into my third requirement – good, smooth, well-functioning, well-built, reliable software that doesn’t feel like it’s straight out of the early 2000s. The only car I have driven with an “infotainment” system was my SO’s dad’s Merc B180 (which is also the most “advanced” car I have used); I absolutely loathed its software. The only other cars I have driven are my 2010 Hyundai i10 and my SO’s mom’s Kia Rio – neither of which have more than a radio (and at most, Bluetooth). Unless proven otherwise, I don’t want to trust brands when they talk about OTAs and “coming soons”. I want the software to be decent from the day I buy the car. If it gets better with time, well and good, but if it is bad today, then that’s a deal-breaker.

# Non-Concerns:

These features will not factor into our decision-making process. They’re nice to haves, are not deal-breakers, and we won’t spend extra to get them.

Any kind of zoom-zoom performance-metrics. We really could not care less about 0-100 numbers, top speed, and any of that jazz. My SO gets car sick, so I won’t be flooring it. I imagine that a dog would not appreciate being jerked around either. The car will likely only ever be used in “Eco” mode and the more buttery and gradual the accelerator response is, the better. If I can get up to speed while merging on the highway or overtake a particularly irritating truck faster than I can with the Kia Rio that I currently drive most often, that’s a win.

Any kind of autonomous driving whatever is completely inconsequential. Leaving out our scepticism about Level 4-5 autonomy being achievable (without first having some form of General AI / Sentience), and/or that regulators here allowing such systems to be deployed within the lifetime of our next car, I genuinely enjoy driving; I don’t want to spend a boatload of money on having the car (try to) drive itself (only to have to be constantly supervised). That said, If the car has a cruise control system that will hold whatever speed I tell it to hold, that’s all I need. If any of those lane-keep things are available and aren’t annoying, I might use them.

We also do not care about styling, colours, or literally anything aesthetic. It’s a car, not a fashion statement. It needs to get us from point A to point B, it needs to be able to haul stuff. It needs to be not annoying. I don’t need it to win a design contest.

# The Shortlist

I have been lurking on the EV sub for over a year. I’ve been subbed to several EV channels and have tried to stay as much in the loop as I can. Based on everything I had read and seen so far, I shortlisted the ID4, Ioniq 5, and the Model Y.

Some cars from Nio and BYD were interesting, but I couldn’t find dealers for any of them in Austria. I had already had a chance to check out the MG Marvel and the Skoda Enyaq and neither cut it on the first priority so they didn’t make it to the list (I didn’t know that the ID4 was slightly smaller than the Enyaq at the time of making my shortlist). I looked up some Volvos and Mercs but they didn’t fit in the budget once we added a things we considered essential (like a heat pump).

Now to the impressions. The observations here are obviously based on a sample size of 1 per model – they could be chalked up to the specific units we tested behaving a certain way in the timeframe that we used them. These impressions could differ for a different unit of the same model / trim, or OTA updates may change certain things *(cough****V11****cough)*. We could decide only based on what we saw and opted to not trust any “promises” made by any of these brands. While I have tried to structure this writeup, the order of information follows my train of thought, and ideas might not appear in the same sequence for each car.

# VW ID.4

We test drove this one for an hour at the end of May on a nice, pleasant, sunny morning. I am unsure if it was a 2WD or AWD and I cannot remember the trim. VW had disabled all cruise control features (including the very basic ""just hold this damn speed"" CC) for some reason so I couldn’t test them.

## Plush & comfy interiors, but very little cargo space.

We both loved the high seating position; not only do we hate sitting down low (one of the reasons why the Model 3 was an instant “no” when we test-drove it last year), but a higher seating position would be a lot more comfortable for the older folks that we will drive with from time to time. The interiors were nice, the seats felt comfy, and we didn’t notice any glaring quality issues. We liked that the seats had a lot of fabric. Neither of us are fans of leather (real or otherwise); I get quite sweaty when it’s warm and absolutely detest anything that isn’t as breathable as good ol’ cloth. We liked the very sensible inclusion of a retractable cover for the glass roof.

We found the trunk space on the ID4 quite lacklustre. I imagine we would have been able to fit dogs in there, but there would likely be little to no space left for luggage. Coupled with the lack of a frunk and any usable under-trunk space, it seems certain that travelling with even just one dog, three humans, and some of bags for a multi-day trip might necessitate a roof rack.

## Ridiculously manoeuvrable, very nice driving feel, but with a few (minor?) annoyances.

I was blown away by how bloody agile the ID4 is. The turning radius on the thing was insane. It felt like a go kart! I could do a 180 in a tiny-ass service-road that wasn’t even 1½ lanes wide. VW have done a spectacular job with the manoeuvrability, making a car this size as slick as a Kia Rio or a Hyundai i10 that’s half the size. Doing cheeky turns in tight, big-city spaces would likely not be a problem with this car, and the excellent all-round visibility it offers will likely just make it even easier. I had absolutely no complaints about the acceleration, handling, or any of the myriad of performance numbers that people like to talk about. Merging on to the autobahn was just fine and the car was plenty fast when overtaking a rather irritating truck on the motorway.

It wasn’t an unusually windy day by any means, but the car was very quiet at 130 kmph. It felt extremely stable around those never-ending curves that we have on the motorway around our area (some of them are 270° turns). I felt very confident taking those turns at 50 to 60 kmph (which is the speed limit); I usually need to drop to 30 to 40 kmph in the Kia because it feels “wobbly” (for lack of a better word). Once we got off the highway, I had a chance to take the car out on some bad rural roads (including a small section that wasn’t asphalted yet). We were blown away by how little we felt. The suspension is crazy smooth; the car was very comfortable even when we were “off road”.

I really regret not having access to any of the cruise control functions; we drove through the city, on the highway, on country roads, and on an “off road” path, and it would have been the perfect opportunity to test them out in a variety of situations. Throughout the drive, I found that I really didn’t care about the HUD. I rarely looked at it and when I did, I found it to be distracting, if anything; it felt like a gimmick. I did not enjoy the shifter being this twisty-knob thingy on the steering wheel. The only automatics I have driven so far have been the Merc B180 and the Tesla 3 that I tested out – both have a shifting-stalk which feels a lot nicer to use. The capacitive buttons bothered me way less than I though they would. The button panels had some contours which made it easy to figure out which button I was on without looking at the wheel (I had to check what that button did, of course, since it wasn’t possible to memorise all of them in 60 minutes; I imagine that in time, that would not be a problem at all) and the haptic feedback made it very clear when the button had received an input. Lastly, the lack of one-pedal driving (henceforth abbreviated as OPD) was a big bummer. Maybe I didn’t look deep enough or perhaps I’m just stupid, but I couldn’t find a way to turn off creep in the system. Which leads nicely into my next point

## Straight up unusable software

The infotainment system in the ID4 that we test-drove was an absolute steaming pile of garbage. I am not exaggerating when I say that the system was unusable; the system took between 1½ seconds at best and 5 seconds at worst to respond to touches. My mom’s beat up Samsung Galaxy S2 from back in the day is zippier. Had the lack of space not been a dealbreaker, this would most certainly have been it.

The navigation system was appalling – it took so long to find a location that we had keyed in that I decided to give up and tried to drop a pin manually. Dragging the map around was an even worse experience than I expected it to be. It was lagging hard and almost felt like frames were being dropped. I gave up on VW’s maps and decided to use Android Auto. It may have been because I used wireless AA, but as unbelievable as it may sound, the experience was worse. Launching apps wasn’t slower than VW’s own system, but once Google Maps was up and I clicked the search bar, the keyboard took a solid 5-ish seconds to show up and each keypress took about 3 to 4 seconds to respond.

At this point, it was clear enough to us that the ID4 was not going to cut it and we stopped playing with the system for the rest of the drive.

*EDIT 23/2/22: It seems that others have had wildly different experiences with the software - definitely ask around, look at more reviews / impressions and test it out yourself before you take a call!*

# Hyundai Ioniq 5

We test drove this one towards the end of October for an hour on a much colder, windier day. We were given a 2WD trim without the glass roof. I am not sure of the specifics as we weren’t told, and I didn’t ask. We took it on almost the exact same loop as the ID4. Having owned a Hyundai and having read and seen a lot of good things about the Ioniq 5, I was really looking forward to testing this car out. In my mind, it felt like a solid competitor to both, the ID4 and the Model Y.

## Decent interiors, but disappointing cargo space

The seating position was markedly lower than that in the ID4 (not low enough to be uncomfortable) but the seats themselves were quite all right. There was plenty of fabric so no complaints there. My SO mentioned that the interiors (especially the plastics) looked and felt “cheaper” than those in the ID4. I have no idea if they really were, but in some areas, the plastics felt worse than the Kia Rio; it felt a bit strange when comparing a 50k+ brand new EV with a relatively ancient car that cost a fifth of the price – we weren’t exactly thrilled.

The interior was quite spacious and comparable to the ID4. Since the two drives were separated by several months, neither of us could make a direct comparison. The cargo space, however, was an absolute dealbreaker. The boot looked a lot smaller and was markedly not as tall as the ID4. Like the ID4, there was no usable under-trunk storage. The 2WD version we tried had a frunk, but even my camera backpack wouldn’t fit in it. It didn’t look big enough for more than a handbag or two.

## Mediocre driving feel, not very manoeuvrable, and a bunch of annoyances

After having my mind blown by the ID4’s agility, I started off by comparing the turning radius. I was thoroughly unimpressed. I switched direction four times when trying to do a 180 on a two-lane road. For comparison, I switched only thrice on the ID4 when doing a 180 on a much narrower service-road and even then, I had space to spare. It was during this process that I noticed some major annoyances.

While I was glad that unlike the ID4, the Ioniq 5 could do OPD, I found it insane that there was no way to set it up permanently. For those unaware, if you want OPD, you need to hold down the brake and press the “Auto hold” button that’s in button cluster on the left of the steering wheel, all the way in the corner. Once activated, this setting stays on till you put the car into park, after which, the car forgets it. Whoever thought this was a good idea is clearly out of the loop. I noticed some uncomfortable accelerator behaviour with OPD turned on and regen set to level 2. I found regen level 2 to be the sweet spot between harsh, jerky braking, and not being sure if the car is even slowing down. The Ioniq 5 also has an “i-Pedal” mode which is supposed to be some adaptive-smart-whatever, but it made the accelerator response feel significantly worse: mushy, jerky, and outright unpredictable.

*EDIT 23/2/22: That said, I am glad that the Ioniq offers a way to adjust regen on the fly. Now that I think about it, I will probably miss this feature on the Model Y.*

Anyway, to get the car moving from “Hold”, I had to press the accelerator in what felt like around 5%-ish. This created an unfortunate situation – once I hit that 5+% threshold, the car would get out of “Hold”, but the accelerator was already pushed in 5+%, which meant that it gave you 5+% acceleration; this felt like a sudden jerk every time I moved from a standstill. The feeling was especially jarring when trying to do a 180. Every time I switched gears, paused, and started, the car would jerk forward or backwards ever so slightly. Even though I was in Eco mode for the duration of the test drive (except for trying out “Normal” mode in the last 5 minutes on the way back to the dealership), an EV is still an EV and an EV can be quite the zoom-machine – this made me very uncomfortable when doing the 180 as well as when parking the car at the dealership. I was extremely anxious of the car jerking hard and hitting something. I would not want to be in a position where I need to parallel park this thing in a big city.

The backup camera (and the front camera) should have helped with gauging distance and should have made me feel a bit more comfortable when testing this. However, the backup camera in the Ioniq 5 we tested was neither super-sharp nor was it very smooth. It felt like there was a tiny bit of lag as well as some stuttering in the video feed. This was later confirmed on the highway – the feeds had a noticeable amount of “jitter” and frames were certainly being dropped. I didn’t feel very confident making decisions based on that camera’s feed. Unfortunately, I can’t draw a direct comparison with the ID4 since that experience was several months old by then, but I remember being neither blown away by, nor being particularly annoyed at the ID4’s camera. The visibility out of the middle mirror wasn’t great compared to the ID4, but the side mirrors were okay.

*EDIT 23/2/22: A ""good"" center-mirror will eventually not be a factor for me anyway. Once a dog-cage is in the boot, there will likely be no visibility at all.*

If the gear-shift knob-thing on the ID4 was annoying, the one on the Ioniq 5 was infuriating. I found the position to be very awkward and the size to be uncomfortably small (I don’t have mittens, but my hands are on the slightly larger side). It was always slightly out of view for me and was extremely fiddly when I was doing a 180. The Ioniq 5 has push-style buttons on the wheel instead of the capacitive style buttons that the ID4 has. However, I found the Ioniq’s buttons to be much more annoying to use. The button clusters are flat surfaces, each with a tiny nub or two to help you orientate. These nubs were not enough for me to figure out where my thumb was, and I kept having to look down at the wheel to figure out what I needed to press to adjust the volume, change tracks, activate cruise, etc.

The “dumb cruise control” part was completely fine. The car did have lane-keep, so I decided to test it out; it was quite irritating to use. Even on a completely straight road where the lane-keep literally just needed to lock the steering wheel in position, it kept making micro-adjustments with each micro-adjustment being an over-correction for the previous micro-adjustment. The result was a very jerky ride and a very twitchy steering wheel. I tried the lane-keep in several situations – the highway, in the city, and on country roads, but the behaviour was very consistent. The constant twitching eventually made my SO uncomfortable, so I stopped trying to use lane-keep.

On the highway, we also noticed that the car was significantly louder and “wooshier” at 100 kmph than the ID4 was at 130 kmph. This could have been down to it being a windier day, so I won’t draw too many conclusions here. The Ioniq 5 was just as stable and felt just as nice to drive on the highway as the ID4. Merging felt great even in Eco mode, overtaking folks doing 100 kmph was ezpz, and the car felt plenty responsive when it was up to speed. Taking those 270° curves was never an issue and I felt confident doing them at 60 kmph; it never, for a second, felt like the car would slide around. The car also felt perfectly fine in the city, on the same patches of beat-up country road and unpaved paths. We had no complaints with the suspension; the ride felt smooth, but once again, I can’t compare with the ID4 directly because of the time-gap.

## Perfectly usable software, albeit a tad cluttered

In a very stark contrast to the ID4, the Ioniq 5 had a very responsive, very usable, quite intuitive infotainment system. Based on some of the menu structures, icons, and layout, it made us think it was based on Android. It never lagged, it never stuttered, and it never made us wait after any input. The map was a bit slower than what I would have liked it to be, but it was still perfectly usable. However, speed limit data was wrong quite often and speed limit sign recognition was horrendously delayed. We had some other nit-picks about the software experience as well:

My SO found the interface to be rather cluttered. There was a lot of information being presented in a rather small area and the middle screen was quite busy. Many menus were very long vertical lists which would have been fine if the display was portrait but the “short”, landscape format made them a bit tiresome. Additionally, Hyundai seemed to have let their marketing team handle naming several menus and features. Plenty of functions had very “interesting” titles that didn’t describe what the function did (I cannot recall a specific example right now, sorry, but we did roll our eyes quite a lot that day). Fortunately, there was always some subtext and sometimes, even a graphic that told us what the function was about. The system didn’t seem to support wireless AA, which was a bummer.

# Tesla Model Y LR AWD

We drove this one two days after the Ioniq 5, albeit only for 35 minutes (Tesla Vienna was apparently overbooked and couldn’t offer longer test drives). The weather conditions were almost the same, but it was significantly windier. Because of the very short test-drive duration, we could not take the car on to the highway (the shortest possible loop was around 20 minutes without traffic, and it was quite busy that day). We also tested the car in a completely different city and hence, could not do the same loop that we did with the ID4 and Ioniq 5. Having test driven the Model 3, I had a vague idea of what to expect from the software, but having really disliked the Model 3, I was a bit sceptical about the Y.

## Ridiculous amounts of space, but some questionable interior decisions.

Before sitting in the car, we popped open the trunk & frunk. The car mostly won us over right then. It looked like there would be enough space for two dogs, four people, and at least some, if not all our luggage. Of the three, the Model Y clearly had the most amount of usable space with its gracious frunk and two under-trunk spaces; it fit our first requirement way better than the other two cars. The seating position was markedly higher than the Ioniq 5, but I am unsure how it compared to the ID4. The back seats felt a more spacious than the Ioniq 5 and much more spacious than the ID4 (this could simply have been the glass roof giving the illusion of more space). Though it had been a while, I remembered sitting behind the driver’s seat (set to my driving position) in the ID4 and thinking that I had relatively little room for my knees, but being quite surprised at how much knee-room I had in the Y.

The seats felt comfortable, but the lack of fabric was very disappointing. I find Tesla’s decision to install unventilated plastic seats to be very questionable. I don’t look forward to my clothes being plastered to my body during the warmer months (which happens regardless of AC). I will likely end up buying fabric seat covers (ones that work with airbags, of course, or if I can't find ones that do, I might just get whatever fabric covers I find, slit open the airbag-region, and fold the fabric in to prevent fraying). Another decision I find questionable is not having cover for the glass roof. We love what the roof looks like but are concerned about what it will mean for cabin temperatures during the warmer months, and aren’t happy about the prospect of needing to pump the AC up; I will probably buy a sunshade right off the bat. We weren’t thrilled at not having a physical release for the glove box, but we can get used to it. The space utilisation was quite nice otherwise – lots of little cubbies and compartments to stow things away.

*EDIT 23/2/22: After spending much time on the German Tesla forums, it seems that the glass roof isn't really a problem even on the hottest of days for most people on there. We shall see how things go once the car is actually with us.*

## Lovely, buttery smooth driving feel, but with a very bumpy suspension

Before starting off, I decided to go through the car’s settings and noticed that the one they had given me had FSD and related functions activated. The first order of business was to turn all of those off. I intend to buy neither EAP nor FSD and didn’t want it influencing my decisions. Once I had activated Joe Mode, Chill Mode, and set the steering and regen to Standard, we finally pushed off. The response was instant, smooth, and matched precisely what I my foot was doing. The other two cars didn’t even come close in terms of how well the pedal-pressure correlated with the acceleration; it was lovely to use.

The steering wheel was smaller than any other car I have driven and took me a few minutes to get used to; I liked that it wasn’t cluttered with buttons. I won’t comment on how the wheel felt to use other than saying it was a strange experience, mostly because I’ve never used something this small and have no point of reference. The two scroll wheels combined with the shifting-stalk were enough to control everything I needed to control. After the ID4 and (especially) the Ioniq 5, having a shifting-stalk and not a twisty-thingy was a refreshing change. The combination of accelerator-smoothness, the shifting-stalk, and the gorgeous camera-feeds made doing a 180 on a 1½ lane side-street significantly easier than it would have been in the Ioniq. However, I am certain that the ID4 would have needed one less round of forwards-and-backwards, and would have been able to do the 180 much quicker than the Model Y. The Y felt a lot better than the Ioniq in this respect, though.

It was when doing this turn that the lack of rear-view visibility really hit me hard. The middle mirror is useless and it’s almost impossible to see what’s behind you through the back glass. Fortunately, the rear-view camera helped significantly – the video-feed quality was in a completely different class compared to the other cars. There was neither lag, nor stutter. The resolution was much higher, the image much sharper, and the colours much more vibrant. It took me no time to trust the cameras as much as I trusted the side-mirrors.

*EDIT 23/2/22: I have been seeing reports saying that people have stutters, freezes, and other quality issues with the camera feeds after Tesla's V11 update. Definitely test this out for yourself before taking a call!*

I had read a lot of worrisome things about the side-mirrors having poor visibility, but I found them to be more than adequate (perhaps even a tad better than the Ioniq). I am a bit conflicted on them automatically pointing downwards when in reverse, though. While this is useful for not hitting curbs, it made gauging distances a lot harder (mostly because I am not used to setting my mirrors that way). I know the behaviour can be turned off, so I’m not too concerned. I guess the combination of lowered mirrors and the camera feeds should give me all the information I need to reverse safely – it’s just a matter of getting used to the information being presented in that manner.

Regular “dumb” cruise control was just as nice as the Ioniq 5. However, unlike the Ioniq, being able to use the stalk to toggle cruise (and control it with the little wheels) was super convenient – I didn’t need to take my eyes off the road like I needed to in the Ioniq. Also unlike the Ioniq, lane-keep was seriously impressive, even on roads that had bad lane markings. Not once did the car jitter, wiggle, or twitch in the lane. It managed to follow not just straight roads, but also narrow, curvy city streets in the residential areas of Vienna just fine. I genuinely hope that this has nothing to do with the car having the FSD package installed. I was not comfortable trying out the “TA” part of “TACC” and ended up disengaging it manually every time I wanted to slow down or stop. Unlike the Ioniq, stopping and going was buttery smooth and there was no jerkiness of any sort.

*EDIT 23/2/22: I now know that there is no ""dumb"" cruise control in the Model Y - it is ALWAYS traffic-aware and there is no way to turn the ""smarts"" off. I haven't used it yet, but this knowledge is already making me anxious. I had no ""phantom braking"" on my test drive, but I probably just got lucky.*

What wasn’t smooth in the slightest was the suspension. I have never been in a car where I could feel this much of the road. Yes, I am including my 2010 Hyundai i10, (which I had coincidently driven the day before testing the Tesla) in that statement. The ride was quite bumpy; we felt every little level difference between concrete slabs, every tiny pothole, every line of those diagonal yellow road marking things, and going over speed bumps felt extremely harsh. This, rock hard suspension is perhaps another item on the “questionable decisions” list. I would have said that the car felt spectacular around corners and roundabouts because of the suspension, but I since I could not try it out at high speeds, I can’t make a direct comparison with the other cars. In any case, the Model Y did not feel significantly better than the other two cars around sharp turns in the city or in roundabouts, and that makes the situation with the suspension a bit more disappointing.

Speaking of disappointing, the lack of physical wiper controls is not just disappointing and questionable, it is straight up infuriating, perhaps even dangerous. I really don’t care if “pushing the button in once activates a single swipe and brings up with wiper controls on the screen”. I don’t want to look at the screen when there’s a fucking deluge on the highway as soon as I exit a tunnel (which is a VERY real situation to find yourself in out here in Austria). I want to be able to turn my wipers to max with a physical control that I don’t need to look at, without having to rely on a (questionable) neural network (just use a damn rain sensor FFS), or without needing to yell at the car to get the voice commands to work (I have an accent and voice assistants other than Google often completely fail at deciphering what I'm saying). I absolutely do not mind not having buttons and I really like that the controls are on the touchscreen for most other things, but in this case, for something as critical as wipers, it’s an absolute nein danke.

Since I couldn’t take the car out on to the highway, I can’t compare its high-speed cornering and noisiness with the other cars. The day we test drove the Y was significantly windier than the day we drove the Ioniq, though, and noise was a non-issue in the Y at around 60 kmph. It isn’t directly comparable, but it’s something.

## Great software (as of V10), but missing a few crucial features.

The touchscreen, the layout, the responsiveness, and almost everything about the software experience absolutely blew everything else out of the water. There was zero lag, zero stutter, instant response, and everything I needed was extremely intuitive and easy to find. My SO could find her way around it much more easily than in the other two cars.

That said, the lack of Android Auto is very disappointing, and I am extremely sceptical that Tesla will implement it. ~~Navigation not having waypoints in 2021 is straight up ridiculous (yes, I know it’s “in the works”, but I don’t like trusting brands’ promises about future features).~~ Speed limit data was very off on some streets, and speed limit sign recognition wasn’t always on point – it either worked well or it didn’t work at all. I understand that I can connect my phone to the car and send texts via voice commands – however, I cannot use voice commands via the car to send messages via apps such as Telegram which is something I do often when keeping friends / family informed about timeframes. If these elements had been perfect, I might not have missed AA, but as of now, not being able to use AA is a very frustrating.

*EDIT 23/2/22: I have been following the rollout of Tesla's V11 update and boy does it look like a shitshow. One of the first things I did when we got into the Y for a test drive was turn on the seat-heaters and back-glass defogger. I was glad that these controls were right there on the screen - the other cars had specific buttons for these things. If V11 had been my first impression of the car, I would probably have rated the Ioniq 5's experience higher from the perspective of my specific priorities (no I do not give a rat's ass about fart-mode, light shows, or gaming in my car). Crucial features like these not being hyper-visible and being a single touch away is straight up insane. Whoever thought the V11 layout was a good idea and greenlit it needs to be replaced.*

# Conclusions

Ultimately, it was clear to us that none of the three cars were perfect in every way. The ID4 won out in terms of manoeuvrability but had the worst space and software experience of the three. The Ioniq 5 was better than the ID4 in terms of software but ultimately mediocre in most ways, with some frustrating elements to boot. The Model Y had the most space and nicest driving feel but had a rather bumpy ride and was marred by several questionable decisions (some of which I feel are unsafe).

*Edit 23/2/22: Further, Tesla has demonstrated that it is completely possible that a perfectly good software layout will be replaced by a hot mess via OTA.*

However, the Model Y came the closest to meeting all our priorities. It has plenty of room, the most range (and I believe efficiency?) of the three, feels better to operate than the others, ~~has a better software experience despite Tesla’s questionable choices and stubbornness~~, and has the advantage of being “plug-and-play” compatible with the Tesla supercharger network; we don’t have to meticulously research which membership cards to buy and which networks are compatible with which partners in which country under which plan and so on and so forth before going on a trip – as long as there’s a Tesla charger somewhere, we should be good.

If there are any other aspects you think we should consider, please let me know! Otherwise, unless something better comes by between now and when Giga Berlin is live, I believe we will end up ordering the Model Y.

If you are in a similar boat, I hope this was helpful. If you got this far, thanks for reading :)

*Update 23/2/22: Added several edits based on new information I have learned in the past few months. Also, once I have used the Model Y for a while, I will likely post a similarly rambly review at some point.*


*Update 10/7/23: I ordered the MYLR in November 2021 and the order has been on hold since we wanted an MiG version. As the 0% financing offer we have runs out by end of 2022, we took the order off hold. The estimated delivery time frame is 16th to 30th September. No nidra if it'll be a German or Chinese version. Let's see.*"

Thoughts on the Ford Mustang Mach E?
I’m starting to look into EVs and have heard good things about the mustang mach e.

This seems to be a pretty reliable alternative to Tesla. I’ve just heard a lot of bad things about Tesla and their quality control issues, their FSD basically being overblown and having issues as well etc so I thought I should look into alternatives of Tesla. Plus I was thinking it might be better to stick with a more established company that won’t go under right away. 

Also, that 7500 incentive is basically just reducing your tax by 7500 right? So you only get the benefit on the back end correct?"

2016 Kia Soul EV battery warranty
Edit: updates below, with a final update after repair at the bottom and in the comments. AMA, happy to help.


#ORIGINAL POST
Just talked to Kia service dept about my Soul.

They said it’s 93% health and 65% range. The warranty is below 70% capacity, which they are saying refers to health not range. Sounds ridiculous.

They say this loss of range is normal wear on the batteries and won’t be covered under warranty.

Anyone run into something like this? Any suggestions of what to do?

I was getting 95 miles when I got it used last Dec, and it’s been on a gradual decline to about 65 miles now.

Thanks

# UPDATE: 

I got the report from the Kia service dept when I picked up the car. They actually don't even have information about the capacity from what I can see.

* SOC (State of Charge) 93.5% (State of charge is the level of charge of an electric battery relative to its capacity)
* SOH (State of Health) 65.6% (a broad measure that doesn't have any standard it seems)

The car comes with a 27kWh battery, the capacity would be measured in kWh or Ahr. I can see from range that I'm at about 65%, which would match SOH, but neither range nor SOH are actually capacity.

Am I missing something here?

# UPDATE 2: 

I called Kia directly and the lady that answered didn't understand anything. She just looked up the warranty and said it was 70% capacity, but had never heard of SOH and SOC and said I should take it to a dealership. Called another dealership, and they said they don't know much about EVs but would take a look. Maybe that's better actually as I can convince them that they need to look at actual capacity.

# UPDATE 3:
Just in case any traveler comes access this in the future: I took my car to another dealership, who said it sounded like a warranty replacement, but they would have to redo all the tests the first dealership had done, including emailing back and forth with Kia (apparently they can’t call them and can only email back and forth). About 24 hours later they approved the battery replacement and got me a rental car for the 2-3 weeks they said it would take. They wouldn’t say what range I would get after replacement. Warranty says just back over 70%. Will update again.

# FINAL UPDATE:
7 months almost to the day my battery was finally replaced. Just to recap, Kia paid for a rental for me for the entire time, they comminuted regularly, but unfortunately where not very accurate with their estimates (it started with about 2 months). The biggest news is the new battery gets me 120 mile range now (when I purchased the car used a couple years ago I got about 96 mile range. EPA is 93, I don’t drive highway much and am a pretty conservative driver). The 18-19 Soul EV has an EPA range of 111 miles I think, so it’s probably one of that model batteries. Despite a lot of months of frustrating waiting, the 25% bump in range is ultimately pretty great. Hope anyone reading this who faces a similar situation has a shorter wait with the same good results."

Why the BEV Mass Market is really set now: EV Startup Fisker vs. Market Leader Tesla (TSLA) vs. Electric Vehicle Maker Volkswagen
This week has been pivotal in the world of consumer-targeted battery electric vehicles.

Just this week, Big Auto maker Toyota announced a plan to spend a mere $13.6 billion on EV batteries.  Its 2030 sales mix hasn't changed: a maximum of two million vehicles powered by hydrogen fuel cells, or fool cells, and a maximum of six million hybrids.

[In reality, Toyota is paying the price for a policy choice screw-up by the Japanese government.  It is the government that wanted the country's auto players to hydrogen to reduce reliance on China.  The government bet wrong. Hard.]

The 2020s will present a open season opportunity for the most committed EV players to grab serious market share of BEVs, especially in North America.  Toyota's market share is up for grabs.

One of the players is EV startup Fisker:

[Fisker, Foxconn Firm Up Plan For Sub-$30,000 EV, Target U.S. Production In 2023](https://www.forbes.com/sites/alanohnsman/2021/05/13/fisker-foxconn-firm-up-plan-for-sub-30000-ev-target-us-production-by-late-2023/?sh=7abee1c26b1c)

Excerpt:

> The companies signed an agreement for the so-called Project PEAR (an acronym for personal electric automotive revolution) Thursday and said they intend to sell the small, five-passenger vehicle with a starting price below $30,000. The two companies are jointly investing in the project and collaborating to ensure they can deliver a relatively low-cost, easy-to-build vehicle.

And:

> The new vehicle will be smaller than the Ocean and likely be available in a shorter-range version, with a smaller battery pack, to reach the under-$30,000 price level, and a pricier long-range version, Fisker said, without elaborating. The goal is to make more than 250,000 units of the new vehicle at assembly sites in the U.S. and overseas.

This EV startup appears to be the only one that is targeting the under-30K market seriously, as in targeting it for the very near term.

There is, of course, market leader Tesla, with plans to roll out a mass market EV with a $25,000 price tag:

[Tesla May Be Planning EV Under $25,000](https://www.carsdirect.com/automotive-news/green-technology/tesla-may-be-planning-ev-under-25-000)

Excerpt:

> We’re sure Tesla is working on a $25,000 EV, but the whole it’s coming in 2023 and won’t have a steering wheel seem unlikely. Most of the automaker’s deliveries have been pushed back to 2022, as production for its vehicles is struggling to keep up with demand. And because Tesla is Tesla, the electric cars that the automaker can deliver before 2022 are its most expensive ones. The highly anticipated Cybertruck has been pushed back to 2022 as Tesla focuses on increasing the production of the Model Y, too.

> Theoretically, a small, $25,000 EV would slot in under the Model 3 as the most affordable vehicle in the brand’s lineup. It would certainly make Tesla an even more popular brand.

Just this, week, however, none other than electric vehicle maker Volkswagen previewed a concept of its first mass market EV to come with a price tag of less than $25,000:

[VW unveils new ID concept that previews its upcoming ~$24,000 electric car](https://electrek.co/2021/09/06/vw-id-concept-previews-cheap-electric-car/)

> As for VW, the German automaker apparently greenlit a new “small BEV” vehicle program that would start at a price of $24,000-$30,000.

> Today, it looks like we are seeing the first glimpse of this new vehicle through the unveiled of the ID. LIFE concept.

This is part of the electric vehicle maker's push to become the next market leader in consumer-targeted battery EVs, and demonstrate that only it can be the Next Tesla: Volkswagen, Das Auto.

Anyways, all three players give credibility to the notion that much of Toyota's 2030 market share, especially in North America, will be up for grabs."

Does anyone know about the Enel X Veefil L3 chargers?
There’s only one spot with two free L3 chargers in Tucson. They are offline veefil chargers that usually plug in and start going. Tonight I had an issue where I couldn’t get it going because it was stuck at the scan NFC step which usually gets skipped… any type of cards I scan including my CC it rejects and won’t charge. I’m frustratingly sitting at a L2 charger now past midnight having to stay much longer so I figured I would post this.

I also learned that the app is total doodoo and I couldn’t make an NFC card anywhere, even though the app FAQ says my android could."

VW ID. 4 - Pro (base model) or Pro S?
Most likely going to lease one or the other. I cant decide if I want to go with lower payments on the base model or get the extra features for 5k more. 

The only real differences in the Pro S model are cosmetic - really nice cosmetics though. The panoramic sunroof, bigger screen, and massage chairs are really tempting. But is it worth it? 

I’m thinking that if this vehicles tech becomes outdated in 3 years, I won’t have put as much money into it and can trade it back in for a newer EV. This is also my first electric car, so starting cheaper makes sense to me."

Should I get an EV? Yeah, it’s that type of question...
I currently drive a 2019 Civic “Sport” and for awhile now, I’ve been looking into owning an EV for several reasons. 

1. Gas, of course.
2. Acceleration or lack thereof in my current car
3. Branching off into something different instead of the traditional vehicle.
4. Maintenance cost.

Just to name a few. I actually test drove a Tesla and I really enjoyed it, but now more and more companies are starting to follow suit and I’m just wondering should I make that leap or just wait it out. One thing that would somewhat bother me is the mileage because I live outside of a major city of where something like a Tesla supercharger would be or any other EV charging station would be and although I could set up a station at my house, I would love to not run up my energy bill since it’s been at a good spot. It is just me, my wife, and our 4 month old girl, so a sedan would do or even a SUV would seem more ideal.

I’m not done paying off my car yet, but since I have no negativity equity on it, I could really sell it without any major hits towards me. I also WFH and will remain there indefinitely, so commuting won’t be much except to stores or occasional drives that’s an hour away and back to see family on the weekends.

Again, I know there’s other EVs out there, but I’m just wondering if it would be something to consider or stick with a traditional car and just get an SUV?

Any advice is much appreciated!"

Why I Sold My Model Y SR... for $11,000 more than I paid for it.
I'm just bored and thought I'd share a Tesla trade story.

Let me start by saying I absolutely loved my Model Y and it was the best vehicle I've owned so far. I will be sad to drive an ICE vehicle for the next year, but it's worth it for the amount I'm going to save.

**Model Y:** I bought a Standard Range Model Y in February '21 for $39,990 + taxes and fees. This was always meant to be a temporary vehicle as I have a Rivian R1S on order that will be delivered spring-summer of 2022. 

**Vehicle Plan:** My original plan was to drive the Model Y for a year, then trade it in for the Rivian. I was always estimating to get about $31,500 on trade after a little over a year of driving and 15,000+ miles (21.1% loss of value in the first year). The max amount I was hoping for on trade would've been $39k or a 2% loss, but I doubt this would've been realistic for reasons below.

I decided to take advantage of the current used vehicle market and how hot the Model Y is right now, but I still needed a vehicle to drive until the Rivian arrives in 10-14 months est.

Why Rivian? My wife and I have wanted a three-row EV before starting our family in the next couple years. The Tesla Model Y's third row is an absolute joke and we want something that can actually seat six adults. We also wanted an off-roader since we love to camp, go on trails, and explore around the PNW. Most ICE vehicles have AWD, but very few are real off-roaders like the Land Rover Defender, Toyota Land Cruiser, and few other choices. The Rivian is the only EV to be announced so far to check all those boxes. 

**Tesla Replacement Choice:** I ended up buying a new Subaru Outback Limited XT for MSRP. No discounts, no markups. One dealer started at $35k trade in for my Y and moved up to $45. Multiple other dealers offered $50k. The one I went with gave me $51,000. This is crazy since MSRP on my model was $39,990. White exterior with zero additional options.

I chose the Subaru because it loses about 12% of it's value (average over the past decade) in the first year. Because the market is very hot right now, a used 2019 Outback with same features and trims, was actually only $2-3k less than a brand new one so it made more sense to just buy new. 

**Savings:** When I run the numbers for both the Tesla in a year and the Subaru in a year, **the Subaru will save me $9,597** including the cost of gas, insurance, maintenance, repairs, resell value, equity, interest, and sales tax saved on the Rivian. 

**Gamble:** The savings above are only if the Tesla is worth $31,500 next year. If it's worth $39k in a year, then the Subaru will only save me $800 at the end of the day. *BUT* this is where the gamble comes in. Do I take advantage of a sure market now and trade my vehicle? Or do I gamble to wait and see what the Tesla is worth in a year? The used car market is at an all-time high and I feel much more comfortable savings $800 worst case driving the Subaru than risking $9,500 to drive the Tesla for another year. 

**Tesla Re-releasing a Standard Range Y:** If Tesla re-releases a Standard Range Model Y using the new batteries at the Texas plant, this will drastically make all previous SR models drop in value since new buyers will now have another cheap choice again, with most likely better range. 

**New EV Credits:** If the government releases a new EV incentive, then used values will also drop since new buyers will qualify for a EV credit, while used potentially won't. This is where I might have a double win. I sold my vehicle for $51k, at the top of the market, netting me $9,500 in savings over the next year. If a new EV credit comes out that includes all EV's sold in 2021 (since the law could pass in this tax year), then I will also receive this at tax time since I was the original owner. If a new EV credit is released that doesn't apply to all vehicles purchased in '21 and only on new vehicles after the law change, then I already made out with $9,500 and would've lost thousands trying to sell my SR in a year when new vehicles get a credit. 

I really hope the $10k EV incentive passes to include Tesla and all 2021 EV's, because then I will make $19,500 by selling my Model Y. Worst case, I'm coming out even with the Tesla, but the best case is massive. 

Here's to hoping!"

My first interaction with Ford Mach-e was not good.
EDIT: 8 months in and all this has improved. Apps and connectivity issues are working as intended. It took a while to sort and it should have been easy! 

I’m 51, and have driven EV for 80,000 mi, in Ford Focus Electric and Kia Soul EV. Hands on with Tesla Model S, X and 3. Tech savvy and car guy. Audi S4 Avant V8, Jeep Wrangler, etc....

My Friend called, said his wife wants electric car, American made, and I say Tesla or Ford. She likes the Ford. We find local dealer with a red Premium, grey interior, and buys car for cash. I see them over this weekend, 180mi on the car, beautiful. I drove it to the Electrify America charger with the owner, and gave it its first CCS charge.

My friend is not a tech guy, at all, 79 yrs, and brave soul for embarking on EV life after decades of Chrysler Minivans......the wife is the one with computer skill, smart phone etc.... Her phone was not with us at EA charger, so Plug and Charge from FordPass wouldn’t work, or so I assumed, and we used my EA account to pump electrons into the Mach-e. 49% to 80% from 100kwh to \~50kwh, then at 80% it dropped to 7.7kwh, as in the speed of smell. 240V 32amp level of charging at 80+%. Not impressive. This is the 230mi pack, capable of up to 115kwh. I know it only does this at 5% etc... but 7.7kwh at 80%+......not impressive. We leave.

The following Monday, 2 days later, I get call, we’re at chargepoint and the car won’t charge. The Ford Pass Charging app sees the charger but there’s no where to tell it to start charging. My friend is 6 mi from my house, I jump in my Kia Soul and head over to see what’s up. 8:30pm, getting dark.

I’m not new at this. For the life of me, I can’t find a way to activate the chargepoint charger. It clearly shows our charger in app, and “in-network” but no start button. 15min of fiddling, nothing, I use my iPhone, my app, and active chargepoint ccs to get his car charging. 100mi, 47kwh, boost it to 169mi. While waiting we call Ford. The automated attendant is awful. Wants my cell, wants to text me, then wants to use my cell to get a location and no human in sight. Hit zero, zero, zero, zero, zero and finally 1 human. They say Ford charging app people can be reach 8-5pm mon-Friday...... it’s 9pm EST, my friends $50k 221mi, Mustang Mach-e is essentially a paper weight, unable to charge with the tools Ford has provided.

After 3 disconnects and call backs, we finally get a nice Ford rep to work on this. She says she’s not familiar with the app, no training, and needs to look at FAQ, knowledge database..., and says the Ford Pass Charging app Plug and Charge feature needs to be activated. This is something my friend did on the phone with Ford.com over the weekend. They tell her it was all set, approved, connected, credit card on file etc....after a very painful process. Apparently this was not the case on Monday Night at 9pm trying to charge this new car.....

A none Ford App,on a not connected to this car phone saved my friend so he could get home. Ford customer service could not get my friend charging. The software in the car was not able to help. The app on the phone was useless. Extremely disappointed in the quality of the app, the priorities of getting you a charge vs all the other crap in the app. The lack of integration of the fordpass app with the car....then the very nice but useless Ford customer service people. I could write an entire message on trying to speak with human at Ford support....wow.

I’m not anti-EV. I recommended this car to my friend. If Ford wants to win, Mr Jim Farley needs to hire better software people, train his people, and get his people to actually use the product. There is a problem somewhere between the poorly trained Dealer personnel who failed to set up the app For the customer, or for Ford to make it difficult to set up Ford pass by the customer, making it impossible to Charge the car. Very disappointed in the experience. Beautiful car. Drives great. Software setup needs a lot of work."

I bought an $4500 mini electric tractor off of Alibaba. Here’s how it went!
(Cross posted to /r/alibaba)

Hey everyone,

I finally received my mini electric loader, and I will say: The experience of buying a 1,900 pound piece of farm equipment from China was an interesting one. I’ll summarize my thoughts in two parts. First, a step-by-step breakdown of everything I had to do to buy it, and second, a review of the loader itself.

(Apologies for the long post, but I think this could be useful to others.)

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/cdraraj5kfb61.png?width=750&format=png&auto=webp&s=62a12b9bed164c436a424f099f01ac49b55973e0

**BUYING THE LOADER**

Once I knew I was going to buy this large, heavy, relatively expensive item, I began the process by doing a crap-ton of research. This included reading dozens of blogposts about Alibaba and lurking in this very subreddit. I got up to speed on my shipping terminology, and even asked a few shipping companies about their services with regard to Alibaba.com.

The machine I wanted was listed about eight or nine times. However, it was always pretty much the same listing, same photos, same videos, but with different company names. Each time I inquired, the representatives almost invariably responded with the wrong information. They didn’t seem to read the Order Inquiry, or if they did, they were confused as to what I was looking for. I ended up getting pretty good at patiently describing the product I was interested in— repeating myself if necessary, and always asking for a quote for a *door-to-door shipment*.

I received several quotes, all of which were within about \~20% of one another. After about three days of back-and-forth with ten or so different representatives, I went with the one who offered the lowest quote. He was also the person who I felt communicated with the most speed and clarity. Many of the representatives I chatted with just disappeared, others never seemed to read what I typed. The guy I used was always on top of his game. Thanks buddy.

(At this point I have to reiterate how bad most of these folks are at actually selling product— It’s almost as if you have to grab them by the virtual shoulders and start yelling.)

Once I agreed to the final price (about $3100 including delivery fees), we discussed customs fees. It was pretty clear that it was going to be about $500 additional (payable once the machine made it to US soil),

At this point I felt comfortable with making the transaction, so I agreed to sign on the dotted line. He sent me an invoice, which included an upfront cost and a final payment. The upfront cost was about 30% of the purchase price and was payable by credit card. This allowed him to prep the order for shipping. The final payment was the remaining balance, and I paid via wire transfer. My bank had some questions, but ultimately It was no big deal.

This initiated the process of, well, a whole bunch of waiting. The updates were few and far between. It took over two weeks before the order was finally marked as shipped. Once it was shipped, there were no tracking numbers or anything of the sort. One day (about 30 days after my payment) it just sort of materialized in an industrial park in Kent, Washington. I discovered this when I got an email from Vanguard Logistics about my delivery… which included invoice for $1300.

$1300! What!?

I still don’t really know why this ended up being so expensive— The invoice alluded to bond fees, documentation fees, origin charges… It didn’t seem that I had any room for negotiation at this point, so I just sucked it up and paid the bill.

Once the bill was paid, the machine was promptly sent to a warehouse near where I live in Medford, Oregon. Here it was to be prepared for its last-mile journey. I received an automated email from Estes asking to set up a delivery appointment, which I did.

This actually proved to be the most difficult step, as the pallets that the loader shipped with had broken. The boys at Estes couldn’t figure out how to unload it once it got to my house. So, in the warehouse it sat for four additional days, until they finally got the courage to send it out to me with the idea that we’d just roll it onto the lift gate. Yeah, not so easy. Long story short, we had to manhandle all 1900 pounds onto the lift gate, lower it, then manhandle it off.

But— Hell yeah! After nearly two months, the item I had paid for was finally here! I tipped the delivery driver well and sent him on his way.

&#x200B;

**USING THE LOADER**

Initial impressions are, WOW, this this was cheaply built. It’s thin sheet metal covered with a tiny layer of lime green paint. But the chassis itself seems solid. Plus it's electric, and unlike anything you could legally buy here in the USA.

It came absolutely plastered in giant Chinese stickers. Google translate informed me that they were warning against doing things like putting your hand underneath the boom, or charging the batteries without switching the power off. Pretty much exactly what you’d expect. And while they lend a cool cyberpunk look to the machine, but I think I’m going to take them off eventually.

I had to fix a few things before I could get it moving. As I removed the sheet metal panels that cover the innards, I noticed that one of the heavy lead acid batteries had managed to dislodge completely. This tore out one of the wires used to connect them in series. I suspect the entire unit was dropped at one point during shipping, because I’m not sure how else that could have happened. I wasn’t able to re-crimp the broken connector, so I soldered it back together.

Speaking of batteries, these things are massive, unsealed, 12V, absolute units. The charger came in a separate box, and it is correspondingly huge. Of course, it’s wired for 220v, so I won’t be able to use it without a transformer. Bummer.

If I had it to do over again, I might request that they ship it without batteries. That way, I could just plug in my own batteries and rig up a charger based on the J1772 standard. That way, I could use a regular electric car charger.

Anyway— at this point, I switched on the machine and was able to drive it around my driveway. Sweet! The accelerator pedal is insanely sensitive, and it's a challenge to drive it smoothly to say the least.

~~Unfortunately, I haven't gotten the bucket to work yet-- it doesn't go up or down. I’m still not sure what the deal is, but I suspect that hydraulic fluid isn't making it to the cylinders. The hydraulic fluid reservoir was about halfway full when it arrived, but I have no idea how full it’s supposed to be. Once I get it working, I’ll update this post with my thoughts about the overall performance.~~

Edit:  I got the hydraulics working!  I've been having a blast moving dirt, gravel, and wood chips around.  Here's a video of me learning how to use it: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoLTmN8nvWs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GoLTmN8nvWs)

Unsurprisingly, it feels a little underpowered.  You can really notice the power drop whenever you activate the hydraulics.  On the other hand, it's got enough oomph to move a full bucket of gravel, and is pretty spritely driving up a small hill with it.

My main complaint is how jerky the acceleration is, especially in forward gear.  You can see it in the video I linked.  There's a 'ca-chunk' whenever you try to inch it forward, which makes precision work a drag.  (It reminds me a bit of my BBSHD-based ebike, actually.  Maybe a firmware update could fix this?)

I'll save the finer details for a future review, but I'll end with this:  My five-year-old self would be very pleased the performance.

**CONCLUSION**

In conclusion, A+++ would buy again. But now that I know how the whole process works, I’d probably arrange to pick it up at the shipping hub myself with a utility trailer. Better yet, I might even try to pick it up at the port and sidestep the need for a freight forwarding company altogether.

I’d also request that they ship it without batteries to save on weight and hopefully overall cost. Unfortunately, it can be hard to know what you’re getting, so it can be hard to ask for specific modifications without the benefit of hindsight.

My advice to others is to make sure you find a good representative, have tons of patience, and expect that your final bill will be higher than you were quoted. If you can do that, you can buy large items off of Alibaba.com."

Will EVs affect used car market?
I can only speak for Europe markets.

Currently for small cars like VW polo, Peugeot 208, Renault Clio. EVs are a few thousand pounds/ euros away from price parity. They also have under 200 miles real world range.

EVs are under 10% of sales in most countries in Europe with Norway being a notable exception.

What I was wondering, is will EVs start to affect the used car market. As in, petrol / diesel losing their value as in 5 years, people won’t want to buy petrol as they won’t be able to sell them on after using them?

I know the used car market will later than the new car market.

Does anyone else worry about this? Should I even think about this. 

Say you buy a brand new VW polo today. In 6-7 years, will it’s price to be affected by the EVs flooding the market? Or will they still be an expensive alternative?"

Looking for recommendations for my first PHEV
My current 11 year old “conventional” vehicle is starting to have issues here and there (AC, power windows, etc) so I’m looking for another car and have been thinking electric (office has free charging stations),  however, I live in an apartment and won’t be able to charge at home and as I do road trips here and there to areas that are not yet electric vehicles - friendly, I think a PHEV is my best choice. Would like a hatchback type with backseats that lay flat when folded and my budget is $20k for a used one, what do you suggest? I enjoy driving my current stick shift but I believe that will be out of the question with this transition. I’m also researching about buying vs leasing but that might be for another sub. Thank you in advance for chiming in.

Edit: budget rather flexible between $20k-$30k."

This may be UK specific, but feel free to chime in with any help/ideas. OVO smart charger help.
Does anyone have the OVO smart charger at home and has it been ok.

I had one installed end of January.  Worked absolutely fine at first but a couple of weeks ago I plugged my car in (ipace) & it wouldn’t move beyond initialising.

No worries, moved my car to where I use normal mains to charge (58 hours!!).

Plugged into the mains and charging fine so I know it’s not some Jag software glitch affecting charging.

Took my car to a local public charge point to try & charged fine, so I know it’s not my charge cable for public chargers and the OVO charger.

Flicked the switch and powered off the OVO & back on again, let it cycle through start up and yay, worked.

Come to today and again it won’t get past initialising. Powered off the charge point again, but this time not successful.

I will be calling them on Monday as they close over the weekend and I am mains charging for now so I’m not desperate for anything but any thoughts, ideas or anything would be good, either about the charge point or if other Jag owners have had issues.

Thanks"

Used Toyota Prius 1.5 HSD 2004-2009 review after 913k km (570k miles) - Sharing my family's experience on owning four Gen2s
**Used Toyota Prius 2004-2009 Review**

People might be bored reading about the Prius but a review on four Priuses (2004, 2005, two 2006s) that my family owns that ran a total of 913k kms (570k miles) should be interesting right? And how does a family end up with four Priuses to start with?

[Doesn't look like a 16 year old car. When we first got it home, the neighbor asked if it was new.](https://preview.redd.it/lp63q23b4ah41.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=73bc562c8ab2a0c1ccd6897c1446de9b06d8e458)

Used Priuses, especially the Generation 2 that were made from 2004 to 2009 are becoming a bargain to buy, especially for the MPG and features you get in return.

**How did it all start?**

We need to go back to November 2017, to the start of the ‘Prius Revolution’ in the family. Due to a sudden company relocation, my wife had no other choice but to drive to her office. It was time to buy our first car. I knew I wanted something for her that was cheap to maintain, had a reliable automatic transmission, came with cruise control, AC. This criteria only left the Prius in play. It was interesting that there was no other options for the budget we had to work with (\~$6,000).

I started to read up on the Prius and started looking at cars to buy in a week’s time, so the paperwork would be ready for my wife to use the car from the following week.

I found a a 2004 with 247k km ( 154k miles) on the clock. When I spoke with the owner on the phone to schedule the test drive, he mentioned he had time until 5 PM after which he had to attend his birthday party on the day of the test drive. On the way there, I made a pit stop at a gas station to buy a bottle of champagne as a gift, hoping to start out a conversation with a stranger on the right foot. I was nervous as this was the first time that I was buying a car, so the experience was new to me.

The meet could not have gone better with such an ice-breaker. He was surprised! The drive went well, there were some minor things the car needed but it had a full service history and when I asked for a 500 dollar lower asking price than list price, the seller accepted. I guess the champagne worked.

Fast forward 5 months, my brother and sister-in-law also had their eye on the Prius. They knew about hybrids and after a couple of times riding in our Prius, they decided to pull the trigger on two 2006s with 180k kms (112k miles).

The fourth one, a 2005 I bought for myself last year with 222k kms (128k miles) with a full service history.

The 2004 has now 293k kms (183k miles), the 2005 242k kms (151k miles) and the two 2006s around 200k kms (125k miles) each.

**What is it like to drive a hybrid who has never driven one before?**

It is actually a quite fun car to drive. Especially in the city. Smooth, silent, tram-like acceleration. Seamless gear changes - well of course as it has a gear-less transmission. Having enough electric charge to last a 5-15 minute in silence in a traffic jam. Awesome, relaxing car to drive. We only drove ’normal’ ICE (Internal Combustion Engine) cars before but those gave me a feeling of always being in a hurry. The Prius is a zen place to be in. It was considered to be futuristic when it came out but it is sort of still is after 16 years. The cockpit feels like a space shuttle but in reality a truly practical space.

[Futuristic cabin that gives it an airy feel.](https://preview.redd.it/2t1ljkdl4ah41.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=98b78ea2a554952e326a1cd28a9ed7decbcc090f)

I’ve never seen climate controls in any other car that were placed on the steering wheel for easy control. Very practical.

&#x200B;

The cabin has lots of cubbyholes and is very spacious. The car doesn’t look as big as it really is.

&#x200B;

[Probably the only angle showing how really big the car is. It generally looks much smaller.](https://preview.redd.it/g4mvh9mr4ah41.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=2205cca692147f844872a8b94765f59a39a08fb6)

Huge leg space in front and back, just like in a Ford Mondeo or VW Passat.

&#x200B;

[Big leg room in the back](https://preview.redd.it/o9x2bpcu4ah41.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=7448241a93227fe974786a4b9f31255c1e54f224)

It has a smaller boot space of course than the other two. It is half way between a sedan and an estate, making it capable of IKEA runs.

[Ideal for IKEA runs.](https://preview.redd.it/qhj21low4ah41.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=72569125d816788298bb72d47492461f99c9f934)

The official fuel consumption is 5 l /100 km (47 mpg) and that is bang on for us as well. In our commute, that consists of 60% highway, 40% city, we get around 4.6 l/100 km (51 mpg) in the summer, and 5.3 l/100 km (44 mpg) in winter. On the highway at around 130 km/h (80 mph) , we get by with about 5.3 l /100 km (44 mpg), a figure that some diesel cars might be jealous of.

[16.1 cubic feet - 408 litres. The cargo cover has a designated space under the trunk floor if we need to put it away.](https://preview.redd.it/n779tdyy4ah41.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=a68552327c52fc826d0f12452d8d8c613951d501)

There is no need for a starter motor nor clutch in Toyota’s hybrid system. That’s two costly things less to service. Power steering is electric and as a result we don’t need to check the power steering oil level as there isn’t any. It’s transmission is sort of a CVT, on which a gear is always engaged so there is no shifting. During reversing, the Prius is powered only by the electric motor. The gasoline engine only runs in reversing to power the batteries. There are two additional components in the hybrid Prius, an inverter that translates electricity from the battery to the motor. The other is the hybrid battery (nickel-metal in the Gen2), responsible for the charge and supplying the cabin with electricity, including the climate control. Yes, the climate control is also electric, making it also working when the 1.5 petrol engine is not running. That is why we can enjoy cool air during the summer in a traffic jam when the engine is not running while the typical cars with stop-start technology can’t, because they have the conventional climate compressor that is only running if the engine is on.

&#x200B;

**How reliable is it after 16 years?**

The inverter for the second generation Prius is very reliable. None of our Priuses had an issue with it. They had some inverter issues in the 3rd Generation Prius in which the hybrid technology changed, but Toyota issued a recall for that. The hybrid battery pack will need servicing but it depends on a bunch of factors. Weather, how regularly the car is driven and for how long. How regularly the EV button is used to maximise electric range. Battery life all depends on these circumstances. A general rule of thumb is that batteries will last a long time if they are driven in normal weather conditions, when it is not too cold nor hot and driven regularly, 14,000 km + (\~9k miles +) on a yearly basis.

But don’t worry if your hybrid battery needs servicing. There are alternatives to the expensive dealership fix. You can use an independent hybrid shop to fix your pack for a much cheaper price. You can have the pack changed to a refurbished one. The cost of that usually starting just below $1000 or changing the faulty modules (28 modules in a pack) individually that is much cheaper. There are also videos on Youtube where people change the pack the DIY way or the individual modules, but be aware to only buy individual modules from a trusted source. Your pack won’t last long if you change out the faulty modules to ones that barely meet the voltage criteria. If your Prius’ battery goes before it’s 10 years old, check with a Toyota dealership first before changing the battery. Toyota has a 10 year program to change all hybrid battery packs if they need servicing. That 10 years now only applicable for the Generation 3 made from 2010-2015, but at least there are options. One of our 2006 Prius’ pack needed servicing and it only cost a few hundred dollars to fix 7 modules and change the bus bars connecting the modules by a hybrid shop. The price of fixing the battery can be substantial in terms of the value of the car but it could be even costing less than changing a clutch, a turbo or doing a major service to an engine on a normal car. I would say that is not a bad statistics from the four Priuses that covered a total of 913k kms (570k miles). [Matt from Rhode Island](https://www.priuspodcast.com/podcast/episode/2750ffcf/a-2008-prius-with-347k-miles-and-no-issues-or-prius-talk-with-matt) reported no faults with the hybrid battery in his 2007 Prius that he bought new, now clocking 555k kms (347k miles).

There is a 12 volt battery in the trunk of the car responsible for supplying electricity for the car to start. It is harder to pick up signs of it loosing charge as we won’t hear an engine trying to turn over in a regular car. There is an onboard diagnostics program on the Prius in which we can check the charge of the 12 volt battery when starting up. If the charge dips below 10.5-11 volts, we can look for a new battery. It will be more expensive than regular batteries as these are AGM specific, but at least they will last for 8-10 years.

The Atkinson cycle petrol engine was made for regular stop-starts and is very reliable. It needs the regular service but we won’t need to worry about any expensive part braking. But there is one thing in hybrids we need to keep in mind. Priuses can burn oil. Even though it is normal (for all cars), hybrids can develop a thirst for oil after a few hundred thousand kilometres, miles. Two out of our four Priuses burn oil. My 2005 burns about 0.3-0.4 l (0.3-0.4 quarts) of oil every 11k kms (\~7k miles). The car has 242k kms (151k miles). That is normal. Basically I don't need to top up between oil changes. My wife's 2004 burns about 1 litre (1.05 quarts) of oil every oil change cycle. That car has 293k kms (183k miles). I top up the 2004 once between oil changes just to be on the safe side, but that oil consumption is also acceptable. I know Gen II Priuses however that burn 1l (1.05 quarts) of oil every 3k kms (\~1800 miles)! That is not acceptable and in this case the engine needs a major service to fix it. That service can be costly. Before buying a Prius, ask an independent shop that specialises on Priuses or hybrids in your area for how much would they fix such a problem. It is always good to know what to expect if you would buy a Prius.

Some models (2006 models for some reason) can have timing chain issues irrelevant of their mileage. The symptoms start with a check engine light (CEL) that sometimes comes on. Code P0016. The more time passes, the more often the CEL will come on and eventually stay on permanently until it is changed. One of our 2006s' needed it changed but this fault is not usual.

Sometimes the engine water pump might leak. It is something very cheap to fix and to inspect. It had to be changed in two of our Priuses. The first sign of a leaking water pump is the absence of hot air when heating the cabin in cold temperature. We will find the coolant level close to the minimum in the coolant reservoir under the hood. If we see small flakes around the inside assembly of the water pump, we can also suspect the pump to be leaking.

Even though these are old cars, they don't tend to rust. There can be surface rust but nothing significant in general. Even though the urban legend says aluminium can’t corrode, the edge of the bonnet made from aluminium is a place where spots of corrosion can pop up.

There is one strange fault with the Gen2 Priuses, and that is water finding its way inside the trunk area, leaking into the two side pockets and the spare wheel. The cause of it can be fixed in a few minutes and few dollars. Water can leak through tiny hairline cracks on the top side of the trunk - hinge area where the black plastic cover ends on top of the car. We used silicone to seal it on ours' and the cabin is 100% water tight ever since.

&#x200B;

[The tiny hairline cracks sealed up](https://preview.redd.it/yhu6c7qc5ah41.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=da1cb8964c59aa8e4016f5138d7daca110d8d06d)

&#x200B;

[The tiny hairline cracks sealed up around the hinge as well](https://preview.redd.it/8oiqkd2e5ah41.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=0e864dd78b10deb8430646443f5edda8828651e6)

One really easy thing to see if it needs changing or not is the front strut boots. If we take a look at the suspension without taking anything apart, we will see a rubber boot on top of the struts. The car does not need to be lifted. Check if those are not torn. If yes, they need changing, because debris that finds its way inside the strut can make it worn out more quickly. It was changed on our 2004 and one of the 2006's. We replaced the strut boots only. There is no need to replace the strut itself. Even if it means taking out the strut to change the rubber boot, it costs less this way then to change the struts.

&#x200B;

[Easy to inspect the front strut boots for tear.](https://preview.redd.it/vq1t23cg5ah41.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d52ac80e89d01fd679dd289dfc0c2cac9a2c41f7)

If we find the buttons in the bottom right hand side of the steering not working properly, the clock spring needs changing inside the steering wheel, a quick and easy service.

Check for missing plastic hooks in the driver's footwell. There should be two, keeping the rubber mat in place. If those are missing, the mat could shift towards the accelerator pedal and making it stuck in the mat, causing a quite stressful situation. It happened to my wife but luckily the pedal disengaged shortly after. If anything like this happens, try to remain calm and shift to neutral and brake.

&#x200B;

[Important to keep the tire pressures in mind. Usually the tire shops inflate the tires to a lower pressure.](https://preview.redd.it/os9bhfii5ah41.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=21c402037ebc17648814e469f35dbdb38740c148)

There was a recall for the inverter coolant pump. The way to diagnose a faulty pump is to take off the inverter coolant reservoir cap while the engine is running and we should see the fluid inside moving around. If it is not moving, the pump needs replacement. [Pablo](https://www.priuspodcast.com/podcast/episode/dca4ff17/what-problems-can-a-2007-prius-with-330000-miles-528000-km-have) reported no inverter coolant problems on his 2007 with 528k km (330k miles) that he is the first owner of.

If the brake fluid is not changed regularly, we might have an ABS actuator failure. It needed changing in my 2005 but that is applicable to any car with ABS, not only for Prius. This is also something very uncommon though. [Jesse](https://www.priuspodcast.com/podcast/episode/fb172143/prius-talk-with-jesse-who-has-put-865k-miles-thats-more-than-13-million-kms-on-the-clock-of-four-priuses) who has put \~1.4 million kms (865k miles) on his Priuses, never had an issue with the ABS actuator.

&#x200B;

[Leave this uncovered for the hybrid cooling fan to do its work if necessary.](https://preview.redd.it/13bjk2gk5ah41.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19bc56ecc1dce48a28c13d0a4d3402f802390ce7)

There is the bulletproof transmission that in order to keep bulletproof, the transmission fluid needs changing every 90k kms (56k miles). This is only written in the Japanese service manuals for some reason. Even though it is not written in other service manuals, it can be recommended to change it.

Rarely the dash can go dark all of a sudden. A capacitor needs to be soldered in the back of the speedometer and there sources on the internet on how to do it.

Sometimes the MFD, central screen, can go dark in US models but there is again third party solutions for it to fix with warranty.

Catalytic converter thefts is something owners need to know about, especially if located in California where only OEM cat converter is the option to be fitted due to regulations. I had a discussion with [Peter](https://www.priuspodcast.com/podcast/episode/1eeb5082/catalytic-converter-epidemic-or-prius-talk-with-peter-the-hybrid-guy) on the topic who has been working together with a company developing a protective shield that can be installed in the Prius.

The odometer can stop at 299,999 on 2004 and 2005 models, that a dealership can reset of the owner prefers. Our 2004 is approaching that figure. I'm not sure yet if we would have it reset or keep track of oil changes using the Trip A or B option. Will see. I guess the engineers did not really think these cars will be driven a lot.

&#x200B;

[The 2004 and 2005 models had the grayed out brake light compared to the 2006-2009 models.](https://preview.redd.it/n9nm186m5ah41.jpg?width=3264&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=d52626e147429f8b1adbb991f8629272893116ed)

The brake light LED can wear out on the 2004, 2005 models. The only way to fix it is buying the tail light assembly. One LED from the six (on each side) might not light up, affecting the brightness of the other five and from a distance, it will seem that they are not lighting up at all but in reality their light is just very low. The LEDs are inside the assembly and they are not changeable like a bulb. This is also something that can come up on a car with 16 years of age. We had to buy an aftermarket assembly for the left side of our 2004 costing $100, so no biggie.

&#x200B;

[out of the 6 brake light LEDs, if one goes, the brightness of the others will drop, causing the assembly to be changed](https://preview.redd.it/xxmj554o5ah41.jpg?width=2448&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=64532afb021d280cb4dfa56cdeca5ecdf4cedaa8)

**Are they worth it?**

Even though we were not looking to buy a hybrid in the first place a little over two years ago, now we cannot imagine driving a normal ICE car anymore. ICEs are just boring and inefficient in the sense of wasting energy. We can only think of driving a plugin or a fully electric car as the next one if one of the Priuses has to go. It won't be easy to find an alternative one as the Gen2 Prius has no real competitors. Toyota well got a lead on the market with this one.

There is always risk in buying used cars. Even though the above problems can seem to be a lot of things going wrong on a Prius, in reality, they never all occur in one car as the examples show. Maybe one or two things need servicing but on 16 year old cars with the mentioned mileages, that's remarkable, especially for the MPG and features we get in return.

Hope this review helps people looking to get a used Prius in this sub."

Looking to buy. I drive LV to CA often
Hi everyone,

My wife and I are in the market for a new car. We are settling down in Las Vegas with stable jobs and our family lives in Southern California. We are wanting to get an electric car because of the rising gas prices and the hope of less mechanic work which could happen with a traditional car and long drives often. 

I know it would be unrealistic right now to find an electric car that could do the whole drive in one shot. But are there models that won’t leave us stranded in the desert? 

We have started looking at the Chevy bolt and the Hyundai Kona. Both claim to be able to get roughly 250 miles per charge. Which would in theory mean we’d need one charge to get us where we need to be in California. 

We aren’t in a time crunch so we can wait a year or two. But what is the likelihood of getting affordable vehicles that can do 300+ on a charge? Are we still years away from that? 

Sorry about all the questions but I’m very new to the electric car industry but I really want to replace both my cars eventually with electric vehicles."

Open Letter to Nissan RE: 2011 LEAF
Dear Nissan, 

3 years and two months ago I purchased a 2011 Nissan LEAF.  This purchase makes me a pioneer of your technology. For the last 3 years I have driven your LEAF and enthusiastically explained to those who would ask (and people ask everywhere I go) how satisfied I was with the car.  I encouraged those I thought it would fit well with the car to take the risk with me.  Sure the car was the most expensive car I have ever purchased but it only cost about $20 a week in electricity for my 300 mile weekly commute, so I thought it was worth it.

As you well know, purchasing this car was an extreme RISK and came with adversity.  The technology was new, charging stations were not yet as readily available and people were scared of it.  In my drive time with the LEAF I explained to others that it took some getting used to and that I had to plan my days more tightly now in order to allow myself enough range to get to work, run errands, and go home.  

Range anxiety is a real thing and a really stressful thing.  The sales people don’t warn you about it.  They don’t warn you that although your miles may show you have 80 left, that the real number of miles, if you are driving at typical freeway speeds, is more like 40-50 miles.   Not knowing if you’ll be able to make it to your destination is terrifying.  Realizing that you didn’t drive as cautiously as you had planned and now were stuck at your destination with less than enough power to get home is terrifying.  Having to use the maps of electric charging stations built into the car in order to find someplace near you to charge when it’s 10pm at night because you don’t have enough battery left to make it home even though you did when you started driving, is terrifying. The maps aren’t really that helpful.  They don’t actually show you where the charging station is or tell you what you’re looking for to find it.  So after failing to find one of the 3 charging stations it shows are somewhere in your vicinity and burning precious power to do so, you give up, risk it and try to get home only to have the entire car die a block from home.   Eventually, you figure out how to avoid these situations, you find an outlet to plug into, you make an unplanned stop at a mall where there’s a free charging station, and you work through it.  Once you get used to it, it’s wonderful not knowing the price of gas.

But then the battery started to degrade.  You knew this could happen but you didn’t think it would happen so fast.  Now the 60 mile round trip to work is getting stressful again and you don’t know if you have enough power to get to the grocery store, pick up your kid, and still get home.  Oh wait it’s cold? You want to use the heater?  Or it’s so hot you’re sweating onto the steering wheel. You want to use the air conditioning? Sorry there’s not enough power for that.  You might be able to use them in quick bursts for relief, but not for any extended period of time if you actually want to make it those 60 miles home.

It starts there but it gets worse.  Soon you can’t do a 60 mile round trip drive.  You can make it the 30 miles to work okay enough but there’s no way you can make it home.  So, you find an outlet to plug into at work and get around that.  Then it’s so bad that you are not even sure if you can make it the 30 miles home without driving 40miles an hour the whole way on the freeway.  

But surely that must have taken a long time to get to that point? No.  It’s been 3 years, 2 months and 65,400 miles.  The battery has a warranty, though, doesn’t it?  Oh yes, it does.  When I was under 60,000 miles and concerned about my range, I took it to the Nissan in Corona.  They checked it out, called Nissan Corporate and reported back that the battery wasn’t bad enough yet to qualify for replacement.  

So, I continued to drive the car that I spent $27,000 on (after the federal rebate and 3 months of lease payments) only 3 years ago and I would hope and pray that the battery gauge would drop one more bar so it could be replaced under the 60,000 mile warranty.
At 65,400 miles the last piece of battery bar that needed to drop, dropped. 

I brought it into Corona Nissan and they said they thought it would be covered but needed to get the okay from Corporate.  We dropped the car off on a Thursday and, the following Tuesday, we were told no. It’s not covered under warranty and furthermore it will cost me $125.00 for being denied a new battery.  Classy Nissan, real classy.

I called corporate on Wednesday and spoke to a man named Ryan.  I asked him to transfer me to someone who could make an exception and approve the battery being replaced out of warranty for free. He said he had the ability but would NOT approve it.  He did not seem to care that his decision would mean that I would be talking to my friends who had called me for an opinion on whether they should buy a LEAF and telling them no, run the other way, it’s an awful idea.  He didn’t care that I took a monetary risk and compromised my life, by not going where I pleased, when I pleased for the last 3 years in order to drive this car.  Customer service or protection of the company image was definitely not his strong suit.  

“Nissan has projected that LEAF batteries will generally have 80 percent of their capacity under normal use after 5 years and 70 percent after 10 years.    …. Together, we are confident that by collaborating with our LEAF community…we will ensure that owners experience many years of enjoyable driving as EV pioneers.”  -Carla Bailo, Senior Vice President of Research and Development

Here, with this letter, I am asking you, Nissan, to stand by your Senior VP of R&D and reward your pioneers of technology with “many” years of enjoyable driving and not leaving me stuck with only “several” years of enjoyable driving.  Those who have gone out there and shown the world that electric vehicles can be trusted and are reliable are your most valuable asset.   When I bought my LEAF, I didn’t see any other LEAFs out on the road; within a few months I started seeing a handful here or there and now I see multiple LEAFs on the road with me.  Those of us who took the leap and went out first to be a champion of the technology should not be punished.  Show this LEAF owner, who has stood up to others when they questioned this car and championed your product, that they are not a sucker for doing so.

$6,000 for a new battery may not seem like an awful lot to fight for; however, it is not only the additional funds but the principle of the matter.  Nissan, stand by your product. Show me I was not a fool for trusting in your car.

If you would rather not, then Helpful Honda?, Mitsubishi?, Ford?, Toyota?, BMW?, Volvo?, Mercedes?, Audi?, Chevrolet?, Chrysler?, Mazda?, Tesla?, Volkswagen?, will one of you step up and save me from the error of my LEAF purchase?  Will one of you value me as a customer?   It is clear that my faith was misguided in this purchase.  I was foolish to think that by allowing Nissan to gather data from of my car every time I turned it on and purchase a car most of the world is still too afraid to purchase, that it might mean something to them when this car turned into a paperweight on me after 3 years.

Make it right Nissan. If you won’t, someone else will.  

Thank you for your attention to this concern. 


UPDATE: So in a last ditch attempt to get someone from Nissan to listen, I googled the entire Nissan Executive team, and their emails and lo and behold at least one of those emails made it to the right person. It took nearly an entire month to get it done. But out of goodwill Nissan replaced my battery at no charge!
A couple of the things they said influenced their opinion were that I brought the car in while it was still under warranty complaining about the range, and also being an early adopter.
Thank you for all the support. And for those with concerns about the battery...make sure you take it in before the warranty goes up so at least that's on record.
Shoot me a message if you end up needing those email addresses, I'd be happy to share."

TuSimple: FAQ for Getting Payment on the $189M Investor Settlement
Hey guys, I posted about this settlement before, but since they’re still accepting late claims, I decided to share it again with a little FAQ.



If you don’t remember, in October 2022, WSJ reported TuSimple was under FBI, SEC, and CFIUS probes for issues with Chinese startup Hydron. Things escalated with potential espionage charges, CEO Hou’s resignation, and a whistleblower’s video exposing safety problems from a truck crash. Following this news, $TSPH significantly fell, and TuSimple faced a lawsuit from investors.



The good news is that Tusimple settled $189M with shareholders, and they’re still accepting late claims.



So here is a little FAQ for this settlement:     



Q. Who can claim this settlement?



A. All persons who purchased or otherwise acquired TuSimple securities between April 15, 2021, and December 20, 2022, inclusive.



Q. Do I need to sell/lose my shares to get this settlement?



A. No, if you have purchased $TSPH during the class period, you are eligible to participate.



Q. How much money do I get per share?



A. The final payout amount depends on your specific trades and the number of investors participating in the settlement.



If 100% of investors file their claims - the average payout will be $0.62 per share. Although typically only 25% of investors file claims, in this case, the average recovery will be $2.48 per share.



Q. How long does the payout process take?



A. It typically takes 4 to 9 months after the claim deadline for payouts to be processed, depending on the court and settlement administration.

Governments withholding inconvenient study results.
English article [here](https://electrek.co/2025/06/19/switzerland-killed-study-proving-upgrading-to-an-electric-car-good-environment/), original German article [here](https://www.republik.ch/2025/06/11/amtliche-selbstzensur).

The TL;DR version is this: Swiss government issues an independent study (paid with tax payer money) to evaluate the environmental impact of replacing ICE cars with BEVs. The study finds that under almost all circumstances BEVs are better for the environment and even the long held believe of ""drive your ICE car until it dies"" isn't actually valid (anymore). The government decides to quietly burry the results. To my knowledge, no big Swiss newspaper reported about this, I've only read about it on electrec. "

Why Electric Cars Are More Than Just a Trend
Electric cars have made traveling so much easier. They are silent and are paving the way to new means of mobility all throughout the world.

Limited Maintenance Costs

A car powered on electricity has fewer parts that are subject to wear and tear than a traditional car. Result? You will hardly ever have to make repairs, saving you tons of money in the long run. No servicing, no need to go to the garage to fix an issue, and braking less harshly result in the electric car making the best deal for the average man.

Quieter Towns & Roads

No sound! The electric vehicle… we won’t hear it coming. And probably won’t be as exposed to the noise pollution it is freeing us from. Having quieter cities will improve your quality of life and the quality of life of the wildlife. It will also prevent you from getting sick. Did you know that noise pollution has resulted in hospitals being busier because it has been directly linked with diseases such as obesity, heart attacks, and headaches?

At Home I Can Charge. How Practical!

No need to leave your house to go fill up your car every other week! The electric car can be recharged in your own garage. An adapter in the wall it only needs down time overnight to be good to go by morning. If you refuse to settle for any less than your favorite espresso coffee, your best start of the day or you can do without the danger of fainting when collided with a stranger driving towards you, bear in mind that convenience starts at home.

Conclusion

An electric car not only provides clean energy but gives you also more peace, and more money.

Lordstown Motors Collapse: Fraud, Failure, and the SEC Investigation — Could It Have Been Avoided?
Hey guys, any $NRDE investors here? As you might know, Lordstown Motors went public in October 2020 promising to revolutionize the EV market, raising over $675M from investors through its merger with DiamondPeak.

But by early 2021, it was revealed that most of Lordstown’s 100,000 pre-orders for its Endurance truck were either fake or came from entities without the means to purchase. At the same time, Lordstown was accused of hiding info about its financial health and production capabilities. As this wasn’t enough, in June 2023, the company filed for bankruptcy, blaming a failed partnership with Foxconn.

These issues, combined with the resignation of key execs and financial troubles, eroded investor confidence (tbh, not a surprise). The SEC eventually charged Lordstown for misleading investors, and lawsuits followed, accusing the company of fraud and deception.

Fast forward to today, Lordstown, now rebranded as Nu Ride, has agreed to a $10M settlement to resolve all these claims. So if you bought shares back then, you might be eligible to [file a claim](https://11th.com/cases/lordstown-investor-settlement) and recover some of your losses.

Anyways, what do you think about Lordstown’s future? And for those who invested in $RIDE back then, how much did you lose?"

CARVANA Vehicle Delivery Experience
I have decided to share my personal experience. This is the first time in my life I have purchased a vehicle online. I used Carvana platform to get the vehicle I wanted (no, it is not a promotional post, I do not get paid for this). When color model and milage are restrained there is not much offers around or even thought US. So, anyway I opted for Carvana because they had a quite detailed pictures on the site. Purchased the vehicle and set the date for the pickup. Once you get there it is quite nice to see their glass automated storage facility. I used to deal with automated lifts so I could not resist to get a video of the process. So, once you get there you will be seated and you will have to sign some paper work (5 min). Then they will give you the big metal token and from that point enjoy the realtime video I am attaching here. The car was in very good shape but I found one assembly issue on the dashboard that was not covered in the shots but I bet they missed it as it took me a while to figure it out. So far no worries the car is good."

Proterra Finally Agreed to Settle $29M with Investors Over Hiding Financial Issues
Hey guys, any $PTRA investors here? If you missed it, the company agreed to pay investors for the issues they had with its financials in 2023. 



Quick recap: In August 2022, Proterra’s CFO highlighted a strong balance sheet with $523M in cash and said they were solid enough to ride out any rough patches. They also hyped up their new South Carolina factory as a game-changer for production and profits



But by March 2023, Proterra reported a massive Q4 2022 net loss of $81M and a gross loss of $20.3M. They also announced that their annual report would include a “going concern” qualification. They basically admitted they didn’t have enough cash on hand, broke a debt rule, and had to beg for a waiver just to avoid default.



With this news, $PTRA dropped by 53%, and the company faced a lawsuit from investors. 



Now, Proterra has agreed to a $29M settlement to resolve these claims. So if you were holding $PTRA during this period and took a hit, you can [check if you're eligible](https://11th.com/cases/proterra-investor-lawsuit) to file for part of the payout.

Would an EV truck be a good choice?
I live in Texas and have recently gotten a promotion where I will be training technicians for my company that will involve weekly travel between Dallas, San Antonio, Houston, Corpus Christi, and RGV.

I currently drive a 2018 Ram 1500 and was considering trading it in for a EV truck. I will only be doing light towing, need the bed space to transport tools/equipment, and cabin space for occasionally traveling with coworkers/trainees. The 240v/120v power availability is another big plus for supplemental power on job sites that lack power.

I was debating between the additional range of the Chevrolet Silverado LT or Ford Lightning Lariat.
I'm leaning towards buying new (a first for me) as I'd feel better with the warranty and no worries about pre-existing issues. But not averse to arguments for used.

I'm licensed and can easily install the home supercharger in my garage. My boss even told me I can take whatever I need to install it from our parts warehouse."

Any Evs as reliable as a Toyota?
Hey so I really want an Ev,mainly to camp and live in it due to constant climate control. I want a car that has no trouble reaching 300,400k maintenance. I think any car build today should reach at a bare minimum 200,250k trouble free miles or its junk.

I'm also looking at Prius primes (plug ins) . They seem to reach 300,400, even 500k miles with barely any issues whatsoever.Break replacements every 250k miles. carcarenut has a video of a prime with 360k miles and he says its flawless and looks like a car with 20-30k miles. that same person now has around 500k miles and just now needed to do a 1k repair ,first one. 

Buut the prime is just too small for camping with the battery taking up most of the boot. For the same money the Id4 is so much more spacious and nicer.

People mention evs save money on maintenance but that only seems to be true if you compare them to American and European cars which are mostly junk,not when compared to Toyota or Honda.

Its just so frustrating because I've done weeks of research ,spend dozens of hours reading,and for every Ev i read Theres some sort of teething issues. Tesla heat pumps keep failing every winter over and over, $4k repair each time . Also Tesla AC's keep failing which I've never heard of happening in a Toyota and the cost can also be 4,5k just for the AC. 2021 Tesla batteries fail. VW id4 software,battery modules and front drive motors fail. Also water pumps. Which sucks because I really like the id4. Mach e hvbjc fails, sometimes even after replacement. ioniq 5 and ev6 iccu keep failing,bricking the car and causing a $10k repair out of warranty. also even when replaced under recall work, the replacements still fail and the recall only covers the first replacement .

The problem is out of warranty these repairs are massively costly ,like 5k plus up to 20k. no third party shop options.  People say oh don't worry it's all covered by warranty,which is simply not acceptable. especially when I'm looking at used cars that are already almost out of warranty and I plan to put massive miles on. Your average Toyota is extremely unlikely to ever need massive repairs like this. I'm not even mentioning the smaller issues and repairs like door handles or air suspension in used model s's(5k cost) because air suspension is unreliable in any car except Lexus.

Is there any Ev out there that can compete with a Toyota? I'm only looking at Evs due to their camping ability. no home charging so sadly I'd have to pay the equivalent of 25mpg in my state for charging due to cheap gas. But I could try to use free public chargers at night when camping.

I really do want an EV despite trashing them. I think their the future and their very smooth and ideal for camping. But I also really want something I don't have to worry about.

I think deep down I have anxiety and a hard time trusting any car not made by the Japanese. They seem like the only people in the world who know how to properly build a car. I wish so badly that Toyota had competitive EVs. thought id also kill for a Chinese Ev, they seem amazing. BYD might be the new Toyota if their cars hold up."

Better to buy used EV from dealership because of battery warranty?
My partner and I are looking to buy a used EV. We were initially focused on getting one from a dealership for under $25k to take advantage of the tax credit. One of the factors leading us to look at doing this through a dealership is that the battery is the most expensive part to service or replace. We're currently looking at two Nissans, a 2022 Leaf and a 2023 Ariya, both used, with a battery warranty for 5 years and 6 years respectively. The Leaf only has 6k miles on it, and Ariya has 15k miles. Selling prices the dealership quoted us were $16,900 for the Leaf and $24,900 for the Ariya.

When looking at used EVs, it Is it worth it to buy from the dealership for a battery warranty? I know we could get one for cheaper buying directly through a private owner, but where would that leave us in terms of potential battery issues down the line?"

Would you trust a 70k-mile e-tron for 5+ years?
Hi all,

I’m a PhD student with a not-so-amazing stipend, and I’ve been saving up for a few years to buy my first car. My budget is $23,000 max, and I’m planning to pay in cash; no financing or credit, so this is a big decision for me.

I just found a 2019 Audi e-tron listed at $20,000. It has about 70,000 miles, no accidents, and has had 3 owners. I saw it in person and honestly... I loved it. It’s electric, super smooth, and the interior feels incredibly high-end. Just a really cool car for the price.

There is an open recall, but the Audi dealership is already replacing two battery cells and told me that should fully resolve the issue.

Here’s my situation:

- I drive less than 20 miles a day, mostly for school and errands.

- I’m hoping the car will last me 5–6 years without major repairs.

I love that it’s electric and doesn’t need gas, but I’m also very aware that this is a luxury EV and that maintenance/repairs could be expensive, especially since I’m not the kind of person Audi likely had in mind when designing this.

Is this a smart buy for someone on a tight academic budget who plans to own long-term?
Or am I setting myself up for financial stress if something goes wrong?

Would love any insight,  especially from EV or e-tron owners. 

Thanks!

TL;DR: $20k 2019 e-tron, 70k mi, 3 owners. I’m a broke PhD student, love it but scared of repair costs. Worth it?"

Subject: Urgent Safety Concerns at Electrify America Charging Stations
Dear Electrify America,

My husband and I are owners of a VW ID.4, which was sold to us with a three-year Electrify America membership that includes complimentary charging (up to 30 minutes per day). While we appreciate this benefit, I am writing to express serious concerns about the safety and management of your charging stations—particularly the one at King of Prussia Mall, which is our closest location.

Unfortunately, we have encountered safety issues not only in King of Prussia but also at stations in Plymouth Meeting, Philadelphia, and Newark, NJ. Most recently, an extremely alarming incident occurred that has prompted me to write this letter and, if necessary, begin a petition to demand safety improvements at your sites.

This past Saturday afternoon, I arrived at the King of Prussia station, where there were already several cars waiting. The station lacks clear signage or an attendant to organize the charging queue. As usual, cars had self-organized into a perpendicular line to wait for available chargers. I joined the line and eventually moved up to the second position. However, a vehicle drove past the entire line and pulled directly next to a charger. After a brief conversation with a customer who was actively charging, that person abruptly disconnected and drove away, allowing the line-cutter to take the spot.

When I approached the driver to address the situation, he rolled down his window and pointed a gun at me. I immediately fled and hid between nearby vehicles while calling 911. Another customer who had witnessed the incident also yelled that the police were being contacted. I do not know whether the previous customer was threatened or bribed, but their sudden departure suggests something was amiss.

While I understand Electrify America cannot control individual behavior, I believe your company has a responsibility to implement basic safety and organizational measures at your stations. I strongly urge you to:

* Employ attendants to oversee operations at busy stations  
* Install security cameras and post clear signage indicating the area is under surveillance  
* Add visible signage and permanent cones or markings to designate the correct waiting queue  

Customers should not have to risk their safety to access the services your company provides—especially when these stations are located in high-traffic areas without adequate oversight.

I hope you will take this issue seriously and prioritize customer safety by making the necessary changes as soon as possible.

Dicey between EVs and Hybrids?
So I am in the market for my first car, I have to make a choice to either go the EV route or hybrid. Currently leaning towards hybrid. The reason I am preferring the hybrid over EV is, I like to go on trails, treks, casual camping etc (nothing hardcore that I have to buy a offroader). Even though I will have access to **free charging** through my workplace, I will panic due to the range anxiety, which I feel will be a bounding experience, as well as insurance is very expensive on EVs, on top of that I am a new driver.

My budget is also an issue where, I have decided to pay off the car over a 3-4 year period. I can dedicate 7 to 8,000 a year for it, so that gives me a budget of 21,000 to 24,000 considering a 3 year period. Now any decent EV would be far from that budget. I will have to look into the used market. Is this a safe route?"

Updates For TuSimple $189M Investor Settlement Over Autonomous Trucks Scandal
Hey everyone, if you’ve been following the [TuSimple investor settlement](https://11th.com/cases/tusimple-investor-settlement), here’s an important update: they’re accepting late claims even though the original deadline has passed.



If you missed it, in April 2022, TuSimple faced issues with the crash of an autonomous truck that raised safety concerns. There was even a video showing system failures, which indicated that the company rushed its testing.



In October 2022, it was also reported that TuSimple was under investigation by the FBI, SEC, and CFIUS for sharing sensitive information with the Chinese startup Hydron (quite a huge thing, imo). The company later admitted to improper disclosures, leading to the resignation of CEO Hou.



As a result, TuSimple’s stock price plummeted by over 98% from its IPO value. Investors sued them for exaggerating safety measures and failing to disclose risks. 



As you might know, TuSimple has already agreed to a $189M settlement to resolve the whole thing. And the good news is that they’re accepting late claims.   
  


So, if you bought $TSP back then, you might still qualify for payment.



Hope it helps!"

Blink EV Chargers Scandal: 2,000 Operative Stations and a 37% Stock Drop—Can It Recover?
Hey guys, any $BLNK investors here? If you’ve been following $BLNK, you probably remember the scandal after the report that accused the company of “vastly exaggerating” its EV charging network back in 2020 and the 37% stock drop afterward. Here’s a recap of what happened and the latest news on the $3.75M settlement.



In August 2020, [Culper Research claimed ](https://culperresearch.com/research-archive)that only 15% of BLINK’s 15,000 chargers were functional (They even included photos and user interviews, tho).



Soon after, [Mariner Research Group](https://marinerresearchgroup.com/2020/08/19/dont-get-charged-up-on-blnk-questionable-origin-story-management-history-and-product-issues-portend-potential-90-downside/) called Blink ""overvalued"" and criticized the company’s reliance on federal subsidies and CEO Michael Farkas’s $7 million compensation, which they said didn’t align with performance.



The market didn’t take these accusations lightly. Within 48 hours, Blink’s stock dropped 37% and, despite Blink’s efforts to counter these allegations—calling them a “manipulative short-seller campaign”—the damage was done.

https://preview.redd.it/id1hjwup4hre1.png?width=2143&format=png&auto=webp&s=2468e1616e73a5ee865a8fd0f9302d8d3b612818

By late 2020, investors filed a lawsuit, alleging that Blink hid info about its network size, partnerships, and overall growth prospects. 



Now, Blink has already agreed to a $3.75M settlement to resolve these claims, and even if the deadline has passed, they’re accepting late claims. So, if you held $BLNK shares during that time, you might be eligible to [file for compensation](https://11th.com/cases/blink-investor-settlement).



Fast forward to today, Blink is still facing significant challenges. Its stock remains far below its highs, and it announced a 14% workforce reduction to save $9 million annually (which is bad news, tbh). On the brighter side, however, they recently surpassed 100,000 chargers sold, deployed, or contracted globally. So maybe they’ll have better news soon.



Anyways, has anyone here held $BLNK back then? If so, how much were your losses?"

Public EV Charger Density Across the U.S.
I had reached out a couple of days ago to find datasets for public EV chargers in the U.S.—thanks for pointing me to great sources!

I pulled EVSE station data from the U.S. DOE and public road mileage from the U.S. DOT, and after a couple of Python scripts, I put together this map showing EVSE stations per 100 miles of public road lanes in each state as of 2024.

🔴 Less than 1 Charger/100 miles (low coverage)  
🟡 1-5 Chargers/100 miles (moderate)  
🟢 5-10 Chargers/100 miles (good)  
🌳 10+ Chargers/100 miles (high coverage)

The color coding is just my opinion 🙂 Curious to hear your thoughts—does this match your experience driving through these states with your EV?

I’ll go first. I live in New England, and finding a charger has mostly been a non-issue for me on road trips—except in some parts of Vermont, Maine, and NH, where I needed to plan ahead.

Btw, I’m exploring other ways to slice and analyze this data. If you have any suggestions or are curious about something specific, let me know!"

Nikola Finally Agreed To Settle With Investors Over Its Hydrogen-Electric Trucks Scandal
Hey guys, any $NKLA investors here? If you have been following Nikola, you might know about the issues around its truck production they had some time ago. If you missed it, here it’s a quick recap and some updates.



Back in 2020, Nikola went public claiming to have revolutionary technology and billions in pre-orders. However, a few months later, a report accused NKLA of exaggerating the functionality of its vehicles, including the Nikola One ""In Motion"" video, which showed an inoperable truck rolling downhill. 



When all this came out, the company was accused of fraud (among its founder), the stock dropped 76%, and investors filed a lawsuit against Nikola for their losses.



The good news is that [Nikola finally agreed to settle](https://11thestate.com/cases/nikola-invetor-settlement) and pay investors for the whole situation. So if you were damaged by this, it’s worth checking if you’re eligible for payment. 



Anyways, did you know about this fraud situation? And if you invested back then how much were your losses?"

Best Used EV's for commuting?
Used Ev's in my area are fairly cheap right now, seeing Polestar 2, Mach-e, Model 3's, and Ev6/Ioniq 5's all around $20-30k. I don't really care about range that much as I have a Hybrid SUV as well. My commute is 35 miles round trip. Currently leaning towards the Mach-e or Polestar. Model 3's were quoted over $100 a month more for insurance than the Mach-e which is crazy. The EV6/Ioniq5 look great but the ICCU issue makes me worried a bit.

Are there certain year models of these to avoid? Any other issues I should be aware of or other models I should look into?"

Thinking about upgrading
Hi all! I have a 2018 BMW i3 with a REX, now at 60k miles that I got CPO in 2021-- I live in MA and the range isn't cutting it anymore for all the things that I do and I'm concerned about how much more the i3 will degrade in price overtime... 

So, I'm debating whether to upgrade to another used EV, ideally under 25k 'cause of the potential tax credit and the state rebate. I drive  100 miles a day roundtrip at least twice a week, and will probably keep doing that for work. I also want a car I could roadtrip in comfortably... so 250 mile range? I've been fine with RWD with my i3 with these winter conditions (and actually... it's been pretty fun lol). 

Wondering what you all recommend? Should I upgrade, and what to? I was thinking a 2022 Kia Niro EV, Hyundai Kona EV, maybe some of those Polestar 2's that are going around for cheap... I really don't want to get a Tesla out of morality lol

 I really love this i3 and don't want to get rid of it (it's been my favorite car I've ever owned), but I'm debating whether it'll hold up long term especially with more and more people stating the issues they have with their i3s over time."

Updates For TuSimple $189M Investor Settlement Over Autonomous Trucks Scandal
Hey everyone, if you’ve been following the TuSimple investor settlement, here’s an important update: they’re accepting late claims even though the original deadline has passed.



If you missed it, in April 2022, TuSimple faced issues with the crash of an autonomous truck that raised safety concerns. There was even a video showing system failures, which indicated that the company rushed its testing.



In October 2022, it was also reported that TuSimple was under investigation by the FBI, SEC, and CFIUS for sharing sensitive information with the Chinese startup Hydron (quite a huge thing, imo). The company later admitted to improper disclosures, leading to the resignation of CEO Hou.



As a result, TuSimple’s stock price plummeted by over 98% from its IPO value. Investors sued them for exaggerating safety measures and failing to disclose risks. 



As you might know, TuSimple has already agreed to a $189M settlement to resolve the whole thing. And the good news is that they’re accepting late claims.   
  


So, if you bought $TSP back then, you might still qualify for payment. Check out the details and [file your claim here](https://11thestate.com/cases/tusimple-investor-settlement) or through the settlement administrator.



Hope it helps!

Need some help, am i the only one? Citroen EC4
Hey everyone, I'm dealing with a bizarre and dangerous issue with my Citroën ë-C4, and I'm hoping to find others in the same boat or get some advice. Since buying my ë-C4 in July 2024, I've faced recurring issues. The AC randomly shuts off for a split second, and more alarmingly, the gas pedal loses resistance, leaving the car unresponsive. Despite multiple dealer visits and even replacing the electrical motor, the issue persists. To my shock, even a loaner ë-C4X 2023 from Citroën had the same problem. Has anyone else experienced this, or does anyone have advice on how to handle it? I'm pursuing legal help to cancel my purchase, but any shared experiences or tips would be greatly appreciated!

One more thing, I was driving on the highway, cruising at 80 km/h, when suddenly all three of my displays turned off infotainment, speedometer, and the head-up display. I was essentially driving blind for 10-20 seconds. Luckily, I had the speed limiter on, but it was a terrifying experience. Has anyone else faced this or have insights? This happend only once and hasnt happend since."

Alternative to the Bolt? After a Test Drive, I HATE the Headrests. Looking For a Prius-Esque EV Hatchback
I'm looking to buy my first EV, and am trying to figure out which one to choose.

A bit of basic info: I'm in the Midwest in the US. I have a budget of $20-$25K max, (preferably less), for newish car with less that 20-30k miles on it. I'm getting a charger installed.

I've driven priuses since 2005  and am looking for a second car. I want it to be similar in size, and a hatchback. I was previously recommended a bolt on here, but after test driving one, I HATE the headrests. They shove your head forward, and will give me a stiff neck in no time. So now I'm looking at other options.

I work from home and mainly just drive to stores once or twice a week. I live in a metro with a couple of freeways, so it needs to drive well on a freeway. We get some definitely cold days during winter , with normally at least a week or two around 10\* to -5\* F. So I need it to be ok in cold weather. I do drive to and from a city a couple of hours away a few times a year (there and back in the same day). There are are a ton of fast chargers both on the drive there, and at the other city, so I'm not too worried about it. I'm also keeping my prius, and will probably use that for most trips to the other city.

The Hyundai Ioniq 5, Hyundai Kona, Kia Soul, and Kia EV6 were also suggested. All of them are a bit more expensive than the Bolt. While I'm looking into them, I'm also wondering about the Nissan Leaf. Is it good? Is it less recommended just because it has less bells and whistles? Or is it not as dependable, safe, has a worse battery, or some other issue? What car(s) would you guys recommend?

Thanks again!"

Blink EV Chargers Scandal: 2,000 Operative Stations and a 37% Stock Drop—What Went Wrong?
Hey guys, any $BLNK investors here? If you’ve been following $BLNK, you probably remember the scandal after the report that accused the company of “vastly exaggerating” its EV charging network back in 2020 and the 37% stock drop afterward. Here’s a recap of what happened and the latest news on the $3.75M settlement.



In August 2020, [Culper Research claimed](https://culperresearch.com/research-archive) that only 15% of BLINK’s 15,000 chargers were functional (They even included photos and user interviews, tho).

https://preview.redd.it/l5scbkrtucie1.png?width=1546&format=png&auto=webp&s=2d0442844b95856f3866b4e6cc86c848302aeab2

Soon after, [Mariner Research Group called Blink ""overvalued""](https://marinerresearchgroup.com/2020/08/19/dont-get-charged-up-on-blnk-questionable-origin-story-management-history-and-product-issues-portend-potential-90-downside/) and criticized the company’s reliance on federal subsidies and CEO Michael Farkas’s $7 million compensation, which they said didn’t align with performance.

https://preview.redd.it/rnaomm0vucie1.png?width=1338&format=png&auto=webp&s=1f05e3ef0505fe63a90300146c9808879fea8f5a

  


The market didn’t take these accusations lightly. Within 48 hours, Blink’s stock dropped 37% and, despite Blink’s efforts to counter these allegations—calling them a “manipulative short-seller campaign”—the damage was done.

https://preview.redd.it/h7k334ywucie1.png?width=2143&format=png&auto=webp&s=55833cf20c68aac229ba8554965cfb63daab859a

By late 2020, investors filed a lawsuit, alleging that Blink hid info about its network size, partnerships, and overall growth prospects. 



Now, Blink has already agreed to a $3.75M settlement to resolve these claims, and even if the deadline has passed, they’re accepting late claims. So, if you held $BLNK shares during that time, you might be eligible to [file for compensation](https://11thestate.com/cases/blink-investor-settlement).



Fast forward to today, Blink is still facing significant challenges. Its stock remains far below its highs, and it announced a 14% workforce reduction to save $9 million annually (which is bad news, tbh). On the brighter side, however, they recently surpassed 100,000 chargers sold, deployed, or contracted globally. So maybe they’ll have better news soon.



Anyways, has anyone here held $BLNK back then? If so, how much were your losses?

Lordstown Endurance Scandal And What Investors Can Get Now
Hey guys, I just found this article about Lordstown and its Endurance trucks scandal that led them to bankruptcy:

[https://www.benzinga.com/general/24/11/42204940/broken-ev-dreams-lordstowns-bankruptcy-and-10m-investor-settlement](https://www.benzinga.com/general/24/11/42204940/broken-ev-dreams-lordstowns-bankruptcy-and-10m-investor-settlement) 

TL;DR: Lordstown Motors went public in October 2020 promising to revolutionize the EV market, [raising over $675M](https://investor.lordstownmotors.com/news-releases/news-release-details/lordstown-motors-surpasses-100000-pre-orders-lordstown-endurance) from investors through its merger with DiamondPeak Holdings.

https://preview.redd.it/m9zy35jgj9de1.jpg?width=2456&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=87b64f22cb9ffc9c434e0d6a25de03d440e30714

But by early 2021, [it was revealed](https://hindenburgresearch.com/lordstown/) that most of Lordstown’s 100,000 pre-orders for its Endurance truck were either fake or came from entities without the means to purchase.

At the same time, Lordstown was accused of hiding info about its financial health and production capabilities. And the company’s aggressive production targets and claims about securing critical components also proved wildly exaggerated.

https://preview.redd.it/33bqe16ij9de1.jpg?width=616&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=869c7ee145cb7e03e266a97919d882aa122dc66c

As this wasn’t enough, in June 2023, the company filed for bankruptcy, blaming a failed partnership with Foxconn for irreparable harm.

These issues, combined with the resignation of key execs and financial troubles, eroded investor confidence (tbh, not a surprise). The SEC eventually charged Lordstown for misleading investors, and lawsuits followed, accusing the company of fraud and deception.

https://preview.redd.it/mlb5veckj9de1.jpg?width=2154&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=06d1602329573ca7fdbe58124ba9db54ce03417f

Fast forward to today, Lordstown, now rebranded as Nu Ride, has agreed to a $10M settlement to resolve all these claims. So if you bought shares back then, you might be eligible to [file a claim](https://11thestate.com/cases/lordstown-investor-settlement) and recover some of your losses.

Anyways, what do you think about Lordstown’s future? And for those who invested in $RIDE back then, how much did you lose?"

The problem with EVs at chargers not charging
Today I witnessed it first hand why it happened. 

I plugged in at an EA charger at a Fred Meyer right next to a woman fiddling around at the charger with her EV6.

I plugged in, swiped in the app and started charging, no issues. I always use the app and never had issue starting the charge (not counting slow sessions, sessions that the charger didn't accept or stopped right away). So I'm saying, STARTING a session has never been a problem through the app.

I asked the lady if she had problems and she said she always has problems. I cautiously asked if she's using the app because it never gave me any problems. She's like: no, I use my credit card. I told her that the cc readers are not very good. She said, well, I don't even know my login for the app. Then said this is too bothersome, I'm just going to do my shopping running away annoyed. She just left the car in the parking spot.

I wanted to say something but she stormed away so quick I was perplexed.

So, the problem is not the charger, or the app. It's the user that cannot be bothered to actually set up their app correctly and know how to use it. It's not EAs fault. Totally user fault!"

Is an EV right for me? Would love some input!

My daughter will start driving soon and will inherit my current ride, a 2009 Ford Edge with a newly rebuilt transmission. I'm ready for a new ride and having a really hard time figuring out what to get, which has led me here.

My average daily drive is 10 to 40 miles round trip. Road trips or long drives would be done in my husband's hybrid,  so finding somewhere to charge isn'tan issue. I need an SUV as we have our own pottery business and I have to be able to move a lot of product in plastic totes in my car regularly.

Adding a charger at home would be easy as we already have a 220 outlet in our garage for our pottery kiln.

My questions are:
Can I charge outside only? I can't park in the garage due to the above-mentioned pottery.  I live in Fort Worth, TX so it's not like it rains often, but would this be a problem?

What to get? My new car budget is $50k. I'd love a Genesis, but they're out of reach unless I go used. Tesla is not an option. I'm really intrigued by the Volvo EX30 and probably like the look of it more than any of the other options, but didn't see Android Auto or ventilated seats (it gets hot here!) listed as features.

I've read good and bad things about the Hyundai Ioniq 5, but I really don't like the look of them... the Mustang Mach E looks okay? I honestly don't know what to look for and haven't been wowed by any. I wish Tesla wasn't... Tesla, ya know? 

**Edited to add: what about a PHEV?"

Tesla Buy-back process appears to take an extra long time
Okay, after several attempts and 48 days in service, Tesla agreed to buy-back my M3 performance vehicle. The buy back agreement occurred at the Tigard, Oregon location on 10/31.  It is now 52 days later and despite my agreement to their buy-back offer I still don't have paperwork to sign over the car to Tesla. Once the paper work is signed, I will still have wait several more days / weeks before getting an actual check. I have followed up several times and the service manager makes commitments and does not follow through.

Has anyone else had this experience?  Does anyone know how to escalate the issue at Tesla? This issue is costing more money (insurance, interest on the principle amount wrapped up in the car) with each passing day.  "

Updates For Getting Payment On Blink Charging’s $3.75M Investor Settlement
Hey guys, if you missed it, Blink recently announced its Q3 results— Revenue dropped by 42% (year over year), which wasn’t so great. But on the bright side, it managed to reduce its net loss by over 23% and losses per share by 50%. So, maybe they are finally leaving behind the problems they had a few years ago.

For newbies, in 2020, the media and users accused Blink of having severely damaged or non-functioning Blink chargers. The same year, the company was also criticized for its slow revenue growth compared to the EV industry. 

All these issues caused a huge $BLNK drop, and investors filed a suit against them. They have finally agreed to pay a $3M settlement with investors to solve this scandal.

The good news is that even though the filing deadline has passed, it turns out you can still file for it. So, if someone got hit back then, you can check the info and[ file for payment here](https://11thestate.com/cases/blink-investor-settlement).

They’re now showcasing the achievement of 100k contracted chargers, but their financial results weren’t all that impressive. We’ll see if the numbers improve next quarter.

Anyways, what are your bets on it in the near future? And has anyone here been affected by these chargers issues back then? How much were your losses if so?"

EV Tax Credit and it's treatment after the manufacturer buys back the vehicle due to the vehicle being a lemon
I purchased an EV in June.  I assigned the tax credit to the manufacturer (Tesla) at the time of purchase to bring down the initial price. In September the car started having issues.  By the end of October, Tesla agreed to buy the car back. My question is how is the EV tax credit treated once the car is re-purchased?  I found the following verbiage in the IRS FAQ:  

  
[https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/topic-h-frequently-asked-questions-about-transfer-of-new-clean-vehicle-credit-and-previously-owned-clean-vehicles-credit](https://www.irs.gov/newsroom/topic-h-frequently-asked-questions-about-transfer-of-new-clean-vehicle-credit-and-previously-owned-clean-vehicles-credit)

**If the taxpayer made an election to transfer the clean vehicle credit for a vehicle that was subsequently returned, that vehicle transfer election is nullified, and any advance payment made pursuant to the clean vehicle credit transfer rules will be recaptured from the eligible entity (registered dealer) as an excessive payment.**

In this case, I am being told by a Tesla representative that they are ""buying the car back"" and that this is not a ""return"".  I am not clear on the distinction here as I was not aware that anyone can truly ""return"" a vehicle.  I was under the assumption that virtually all vehicle ""returns"" are actually buy backs.  

I am trying to understand who gets the tax credit? Is this just a windfall for Tesla? I have done some research and found that in a situation where the tax credit is not assigned, there is a windfall of $7500 to the buyer since the buyer had no intention of selling the vehicle when they purchased it.  

I am trying to get clarity from the IRS, but there does not appear to be a way to reach a person. 

Has anyone else faced this issue and can they share their experience or resources?"

Nikola Is Betting On Hydrogen And Paying $14.9M Investor Settlement
Hey guys, I guess there are NKLA and old RMO investors here. If you missed it, Nikola managed to beat the predictions on its Q2 results: they got $31.3M in revenue and $256.3M in cash. That’s great news, and a nice pivot after the issues RMO (now part of NKLA) had with its revenue some time ago. 



Long story short, Romeo was accused of having a serious shortage of crucial battery cells for their packs due to supply issues. They only had two suppliers, not four as they claimed, which affected their business badly. And, in 2021, they ran out of cells, impacting revenue growth. 



After this situation, they were hit with a lawsuit from the investors, which they recently resolved with a $14.9M settlement (they´re accepting claims over this even after the deadline). So, if someone's late, you still can [file for it](https://11thestate.com/cases/romeo-power-shareholder-settlement).

Advice for electric Vauxhall corsa
Hello all, I am looking for some advice on a Corsa-e which I bought from a UK dealer in September 2023 (13 months ago).

Some details to note before I describe the situation;
Car is out of manufacturers warranty, bought on PCP but the battery is still in warranty.

So, I began getting issues in December last year, where the car would cut out whilst driving. I quickly contacted the dealership and paid for an investigation, which they said showed no signs of faults. I then lasted a good few months until the issue came back, when it came back this weekend I was doing 60mph on the motorway and the car lost acceleration, started shaking then came to a stop in the middle of the live motorway. I raised it with the dealership again and they said they would charge £180 for another investigation. I have now raised the issue with my finance provider who said they will raise a complaint. 
The error that comes up before cutting out is “electric traction system fault, see owners manual” 

Nothing in the manual looks helpful wrt the above fault and I had a friend look at the diagnostics who said there was only one fault in the history which looked related to a control module.

So my question is, has anyone had a similar issue with electric vauxhall’s, how did you prove the issue? Any general recommendations?

Thanks!"

Nissan Leaf Battery Failure Outside of Warranty
2016 Nissan Leaf SV Original battery failed, replaced under warranty in Oct, 2020. Second battery failed. 

I initially brought the car in early in the year, range dropped from 140 miles to 80 miles. Nissan tested the battery and said the battery was fine despite the issue. 

Battery continued to deplete. I called several times over six months, talking to different people to find out my options. They all said that Nissan will not cover the car and there is nothing they can do. 

I brought it in again a week ago. They confirmed the battery has failed. They will not cover it due to being over warranty by 304 miles and 20 days. Nissan Consumer affairs has reviewed and said that they will not cover the repair. 

I realize and own my mistake here, not bringing it in sooner and my own lack of awareness that the second battery might be covered under the original warranty despite being told it wouldn't be. So please, let's skip all that feedback. I'd like to focus on any creative options on how to address this with Nissan or otherwise. "

From Autonomous Trucks To AI Games: What’s Going On With TuSimple
Hey guys, I think we all know by now what a wild ride TuSimple has been on. They started as a promising company (in fact, they were the first autonomous trucking startup to go public), but then it all went downhill.



In early 2022, they had issues keeping its CEO and CFO, and Mo Chen got 60% of the votes on the board. Then, the failure of an autonomous truck led to increased controls in the safety systems and a lawsuit from investors over rushed testing. They already settled $189M with shareholders over this safety situation, and are [taking claims](https://11thestate.com/cases/tusimple-investor-settlement).



By 2023, the collaboration with Navistar fell, and they fired 500 employees (it was a “mandatory long holiday” that never ended). So in January this year, with this unclear landscape, the company decided to delist from Nasdaq and go private voluntarily.



And, as if that wasn’t unexpected enough, it came out that TuSimple is trying to move their assets to China to switch from trucks to the gaming world and create a video game based on the science fiction novel series ""The Three-Body Problem” (btw, leading to a federal investigation into the company’s ties with China).  
  


So, after all that story, has anyone here had $TSP when this truck crash happened? If so, how much were your losses?

I'm in the market to buy and it seems range is a big issue. 

But it's also clear that expected range and actual range differs a lot on driving habits. Does any website document \*accurately\* the actual range of specific cars under different driving conditions (i.e. highway cruising versus, suburban driving)?

EVs: Why Buc-ee's is picking a fight with Gov. Ron DeSantis
# Florida is one of a dozen states that have yet to issue a single RFP using federal dollars to construct EV charging stations. Gas stations see the chargers as an avenue to compete with local power companies.

What EV for Me: Under $50K, fun to drive, good tech and a bit luxurious
I am highly likely to get an EV and super psyched. But there are lots of options.

This will be our car around the town and short road (under 150 mile) road trips so range isnt an issue. We'll be charging this mostly at home as well.

The criteria I have are:

a) Under $50K preferably close to $40K. We don't qualify for the $7.5K Fed rebate

b) Good tech. Nice dash, nice stereo system, good safety features  
c) Sporty to drive. 0-60 in under 7 for sure.  
d) Some luxury. Leatherette seats, classy looking interior

Of course I will investigate the Iqonic 5/EV6 as Car and Driver rates them so highly. But what else?

To give you an idea of what I \*dont\* want I'll point to an VW ID.4. It's slow off the mark and the tech/dash makes it look East German. I own an VW (Tiguan) and love it, but that ID.4. was awful.

I guess a related question is what is the sweet spot for EV purchases when above it, the returns are diminishing.

Are EVs Vehicles You Can Hold for 10+ Years?
My wife and I typically buy new and hold the vehicles for ten years. Due to the great electricity rate in our area (under $0.10 a kilowatt hour). we are going to get an EV.

For ICE cars that works out fine but is it the same for EV? For example does the battery capacity degenerate like a regular battery in a car? Do the engines/motors hold up for 10+ years.

Any other known issues for EVs if you hold them for 10 years"

Help me pick my 1st!
Looking to buy my 1st electric car.

My requirements are:

* Maximum price €60,000 (but hoping to pay a lot less)
* At least 400km range
* Reasonably fast charging 
* Not very wide (narrow streets)
* Suitable for light off-roading (AWD?)
* Bidirectional charging capability would be a plus but not a must

And of course I want it to last a long long time without any major issues.

Am I asking for too much? Anything else I should look for? 

P.S. I am in Europe. There's no Tesla service point where I live so, no Tesla. "

New to EVs, considering my first one
Hello guys!
My next car is going to be a used EV, i've made up my mind about that already. But I have a few questions.
I commute 62 miles (100km) round trip to work every day, and 95% of that is on the highway at 68 mph (110kmh). I can cut this down to 50 miles (80km) with 30% city 70% highway in the winter if needed. My fuel costs are through the roof (4000 usd on just fuel yearly, oil changes, filters, sensors, fluids, etc) with my current car which is a Volvo S60 2.4t automatic. I will not get another cheaper car, I want to stay comfortable and have power if needed. I want to get an EV to cut down on this and save money in the long run. If I like my EV i might even sell my current ICE after half a year. I have solar at home, so I could do level 2 charging (240v is level 2 right?) at 3.3kw from solar purely, or 6.2kw from solar+grid as my inverter can do power assist. I will very rarely if ever use a quick charger.
Things to consider: 
-I live in central Europe, close to the balkans. The summers here are long (4-6 months) and hot (ambient temperature can be from 86f/30c up to 100f/36c)
- I will have to take out a loan for sure. Can pay about 50% of the car in cash

Now the questions: 
Do I need a liquid cooled battery car for these temperatures? Is it neccesary?
I will need a 50kwh car minimum right?

I was considering 2 cars:
Opel Corsa E, 50kwh, has liquid cooled battery, would fit my needs. Lots of horror stories about electric traction control problems which anything can cause, and after very costly repairs can ranfomly come back. I dont wanna have to deal with a lot of issues if possible.  And I heard Vauxhall customer service is nonexistent.
I could get one used from 2020 with 25k miles (40k km) for 15.5k dollars. SOH 99%.

Nissan leaf tekna e+ 62kwh.
I like this car a lot more because of the bigger battery, size, and power.
However the battery is air cooled. 
I could get one from 2020 also with 43500 miles (70000km) for 16.5k dollars.  SOH 96%. Is this realistic? Are there any common problems?

Which one should I get and why?"

Which EV sedan to get
Looking at getting a new (new to me, low miles) sedan EV. Requirements:

— Can do 500 winter miles (30F and sunny) in under 8-8:15 hours (BMW i4 40 is 8:10 total time, F-150 lightning extended at 8:45)

— Not Tesla or Lucid

— Can handle winter midwestern roads decently

— Comfort more important than sportiness

— Reasonable shot at getting clean title  for under $50K

— Looks are not super important

Reasons for excluding Tesla: I don’t want to have to relearn how to drive the car, closed ecosystem, build quality, Musk

Reasons for not choosing Lucid: post sales support (Ii live 3 hours from the nearest Lucid shop and would have to pay to flatbed it back to them if any issues occurred post warranty)

Thanks in advance!

Looking to buy a used/second-hand EV car
Looking to buy a used/second-hand EV car under 10k EUR and apply for the government premium for EVs.

In Belgium they still offer it in 2024 so it'd be good to act fast.

We're tight on a budget and we're affraid (and cannot afford) the risk to loose all money if the battery or the engine suddenly stop working.

There are stories with EVs whose electric system faulted and the repair was almost the price of the whole car.

With that said, here are some cars we thought about, priced ascending:

Bollore Bluecar (B)attery 29kw | (R)ange 250km | \~4k EUR  
Citroen C0 / Peugeot iON B 16kw | R 130km | \~4k EUR  
Smart ForFour B 16kw | R 130km | \~7k EUR  
Renault Zoe B 22kw | R 150km | \~8k EUR  
Nissan Leaf '17 30kw | R 150km | \~8.5k EUR  
Nissan Leaf '18 41kw | R 230km | \~10k+ EUR  
Seat Mii EV 41kw | R 320km+ (is that even real and has really low consumption?) | \~10k EUR

My wife likes the Zoe but there are many people saying at 70k km the engine breaks fully while many others with electrical issues or water infiltration issues.  
Also the car has a poor NCAP rating and as a family with a daughter we're not sure it's safe.  
But nowadays NCAP is given based on onboard equipment like pedestrian avoidance, etc. rather than actual impact ratings. And the other cars are not much better.  
In any case, the only alternative with good NCAP are the Nissan Leafs but quite expensive for their range(at least the '17 one).  
We saw many models having +100k km so perhaps some survive past that.

Is it happening systematic to all people while some others survive(from where the people with happy stories) or is it a thing like ""only people with problems speak out while the happy ones keep away""?

I had a long time his eyes on the Bollore being the cheapest one and with most range.  
But having read many horror stories with batteries dying out of the ""blue"" or the evident fact that it consumes electricity while parked made us stay away from it. Not sure yet if it was a wise choice, wish there was someone else to help out.  
I now strongly consider the Smart ForFour due to low price and being from a reputable company.  
It's compact like the Bollore and cheap but of course much lower on the range side.  
I think Zoe is similar and a bit better equipped(LCD touch, etc.) but with it's whole range of issues not worth it's price. At least not the 22kw model we can afford.

We both strongly considered the Nissan Leaf range.  
The '18 one, but with our 10k limit it's hard to find one with a low mileage. Only 100k+ km came out in our searches.  
Also the '17 one looks overpriced(8.5k+) for the range it offers and we're concerned about it's dying cells and all battery issues.

But both offer a great interior space and excellent NCAP ratings which made us for a long time turn our heads to these 2 models.  
And due to all the things we read we're sometimes tired of EVs altogether and we're unfortunately considered going back to ICEs.

We so very much would love an EV if it weren't to break. As it would allow much lower prices on electricity compared to gas and being able to use the gov. premium which helps in reducing buying costs as well.

We really hope someone could shed some light if the rumors are real about the Leaf's dying batteries or Zoe's failing engine.And what about Smart ForFour, we're inclined for it due to not hearing many people with problems.

But perhaps because Zoe's or Leaf's community is much bigger is the reason for them being plagued with issue reports.

So is Smart actually the safer bet between all the options? Or would we also have surprises with it as well?

We hope someone could help give some advice to help out as we've been walking in circles for weeks/months already and when we got close to taking a decision, we got led-out by people having problems with those car models.

Thank you so much for helping out!"

EV - math on lease vs buying used
I'm new to the EV market and so far on gas cars I had my issues trusting dealers that 'leasing is my best option', so I always bought used.

These days they say again that 'leasing is my best option' on an EV. So I went testing an ID4 Standard, which would cost me $250 for 36 month (12k) plus $6300 at signing (not a great offer in my opinion). $15k gone in the wind after 3 years.

The 2024 S would be $460 plus 4k at signing (20 k in the wind).

They also have an 2023 ID4 S (so higher trim) with 10k miles for 27k (excluding tax of course), so roughly 30k, b

In 3 years the used one would need to be less than 10k (or 15k for the lower trim) in order to be the less good option in buying used and it would be mine.

Do I do something wrong on my math here, is the used 2023 ID4 a terrible car or is the dealer just being dealer and leasing 'is the best option for him'?

What I'm wanting is most likely a city car to drive the kids around and if we like it it stays as only car. I'd go with an ID3, but they don't sell it here. Used Model 3 is also fine.."

Used EV. Buy now or wait?
I'm currently considering a used Ford Mach-e or Hyundai Ionic 5/Kia EV6. I owned a Mach-e for a while and it was a decent car, but I had the base model Select RWD standard range and it was lacking. I'm seeing used ones go for under $25k now and eligible for the $4k Fed. tax credit and my state also offers another $2500 on top of that. So we are talking about $18k out the door for a 2-3 year old EV. My question is, since the values of these things have plummeted, does it make sense to buy now or wait another 3-6 months when they could be even cheaper? I don't need a car right now so waiting isn't an issue. "

Advice welcomed 
Happy Friday and thanks for reading!

I am in the market to buy a used EV and would love opinions, advice, etc. I have spent the past hour at work looking around and seems like Nissan Leaf or Telsa Model 3, are pretty good value for being affordable options.

My main issue is that there are so many used Leafs for sale; I'm not sure which year model is best/worst/avoid at all costs. There is a lot of information and it is overwhelming to parse through, and would love any assistance to not reinvent the wheel.


I have no preference to brand and am very much a function over form. I value quality over affordability.

My budget is under $35k, so really more like $30k.

Round trip my daily commute is ~40 miles. It is 16 one way, but I have to drop my child off at school on the way to and from work.

I do need room for a car seat/booster seat so no 2 seaters.

My employer provides EV parking/charging. So shorter battery life is not really an issue. Or maybe it is and I'm ignorant of something.

I will have a 2nd gasoline vehicle for any long distance trips.

I'm not committed to a Leaf, but looking for suggestions of best value at my price point. 


Hopefully my preferences help provide enough context to give a decent recommendation."

Tesla guidance
My husband and I refuse to take out auto loans.  We purchase an older higher mileage ICE vehicle, drive it for a few years, my husband does almost all of our repair and maintenance work, we sell, and repeat. 

My husband drives a huge gas guzzler and pulls a heavy trailer for work daily. We need to hand down my current vehicle to our teenagers as quickly as possible (for my sanity), and we'd really like to dip our toes into the Tesla waters specifically. My husband isn't scared of doing any of the mechanical type work to the vehicle (door handles, 12 V replacement, cabin filters, control arms, brakes, etc) the only fear is the gamble of the HV Battery that everyone fears.

We recently found 2 long range 2018 Model 3s with 170k and 180k miles for $10,999, there are a lot of Model S's 2013-2015 for $9k-$13k - but I've heard about more battery issues with these models, and dare I say the word *whisper*salvaged title *whisper*😬 one that is a 2020 with 80,000, they say we can use Keysavvy on it, that supercharging still works and that they have receipts from Teslas 100 point inspection and checking the battery, for $12k.

We wanted to purchase with the same intention of having it for 2-3 years while we save for the next that would be a higher price, newer, and with less mileage. We really aren't concerned about resale value either.

Is this thought process reasonable? Would a newer model 3 with mileage this high be better than a 2014/2015 model S with less miles? Are these decent prices or should we just stick with our typical ICE vehicle routine for the next few years?

No Garage AND Anxiety - Is an Electric Car for Me?
Hello /r/electriccars! I am considering an electric car, but have 2 seperate issues I can't imagine are that uncommon, so I'm wondering if anyone has advice. 

First is logistical - the house I will be moving to shortly does not have a garage, will that be a problem? I guess we would have to install a charging outlet on the side of the house nearest the driveway. Would it need to be protected from rain/snow? Could it short out or anything being exposed to the elements? Will this be a problem?

Second - I have pretty bad anxiety about a lot of stuff. Running out of fuel is a nightmare scenario for me. If my car gets under 1/3 tank of gas I start getting nervous and need to fill up immediately. Where I will be moving to (Boston, USA area) should have plenty of chargers, I assume, but I'm worried I will always be concerned about where is the closest charger, what if it is occupied or not working when I get there, will I end up being late because I have to drive around looking for a charge, etc. A roadtrip feels like an impossibility due to this anxiety, too. Gas is easy, there are stations everywhere. Does anyone else have anxiety about this? Have you found any way to mitigate it? Is it really a non-issue and I'm anxious about nothing(not the first time for that lol!)?

Any thoughts or input much appreciated!

My first and last Tesla
Today I sold my first EV, a 2018 Tesla Model X, and tomorrow I pick up a new BMW iX eDrive50.  When I bought my Tesla, I was excited to experience such  amazing innovation, dramatically reduce my carbon footprint, and drive such a cool looking car.  Then, the quality issues started to emerge for me, and it became apparent that Tesla/Musk has, IMO, a laser focus on self-driving, not necessarily making a better and safer car that happens to run on electricity.  And I found myself unconvinced by Elon’s arguments that Tesla’s self-driving tech is not endangering people. Then, the anti-union stuff started happening.  Then, Musk started using his money and influence to undermine American democracy and spread techno-utopian libertarian BS.  So, with that, I can’t begin to tell you how good feels to have found such a great alternative to Tesla, although it took time.  Yes, I know about the BMW founders’ NAZI ties, and I know about its efforts to avoid unionization in the US.  But, for now, I know I’m buying a car made with union labor and designed by engineers paid to make better cars, not sell me on some Jetsons fantasy about self-driving cars. Yes, we’ll have them someday, but I sure as hell won’t be buying one from Tesla.  I hope those of you out there dying to buy your first EV will give BMW a look.  I test drove them all, and BMW stands out if driving performance and car build quality are a priority for you.  Yes, there are aspects of the Model X I’ll miss. It was my first EV experience and a very cool ride, for a while. But I can’t begin to get behind the wheel of my new BMW iX.  "

A BYD Seagull or Dolphin is our ideal EV - but once a week we drive to a cabin which is 3.5km on dirt road...
This is basically it. We love those small beautiful cars. We would not actually need buying advice...

...were it not for our weekly trip to the cabin. It's 3.5km on a dirt road, which usually is in decent shape, but after some time it gets potholes and irregularities. Every 2 or 3 years a machine drives thru and flattens it anew, and it becomes pretty good again. It's the tropics here.

So...that's the issue. Could a Seagull or Dolphin make it here, or will we drive it down and possibly break it in such conditions?

We know they are actually urban cars.

But then...there isn't much around for that kind of needs. Closest might be the BYD Yuan Plus, at double the price...

We used to have a Suzuki Jimny 1.3l for reference. There's the new Bao Jun Yep which might be the only alternative, but we couldn't find any info about when it will become available (and our country is usually way later, if at all). There's the Vietnamese VinFast VF3, but same, no availability info, plus, not sure what to think about a vietnamese car yet.

Any advice?

Question, EV 12 volt system.
I recently had my 12 volt battery die, my commute is pretty short so it doesn't really get enough time to charge fully I guess, had the same issue with my truck back in the day, took almost 3 years to do it though so that's pretty good I guess. I just had it at the shop, that's where it died actually, and the battery passed their load tests and stuff so its just the charge level I need to worry about atm. I park outdoors so I'm thinking a solar maintainer. Any suggestions that are easy to hook up ? I have a 2020 Kona BEV.

EDIT:

Second question, if I get stranded outside the vehicle, unable to access the hood release, is there a way to jump it in the same vein as a Tesla where you can jump start the electrical system with a 9volt.

EDIT:  
Problem solved for second question. I've been using keyless entry for so long I forgot my doors have a key lock. 😜"

Dacia Spring not charging
Hello! I bought a Dacia Spring a week ago and after two days I tried to charge it at home. The seller assured me it would be possible to charge it anywhere but it could take longer if I had low power at home. In 8h it charged 1% so I tried another power outlet and it didn't charge at all. I tried another one and it charged 5%, stopped charging, charged another 10% and then I turned it off because the cable was getting hot and it was getting late (I needed to leave my front door open in order to plug the cable in this outlet, while the first two are outside in the garage). I also noticed that my cable does not lock when I lock the car. What I mean is, I lock the car and I am still able to pull the cable off, which is not supposed to happen. My seller says I should keep trying to lock the cable and see if it keeps happening but I tried over 10 times and it only locked twice. Do you think it's a cable issue or a power issue?"

New to EV
I’m trying to decide what EV vehicle will be the best option for my family and I’m hoping this community can assist. This will be our first car payment in years. I’m not thrilled about it but with how much we are spending on gas, we might break even or save a few bucks. 

We have a 2011 8 seater SUV that we put less than 10k miles a year (112k). This is our weekend/camping trip vehicle. Our other vehicle is our commuter (2001 Toyota) which we put 60-70 miles daily (work and school). We fuel up 2x week ($50-$55 each fill). The car is starting to give us issues, high mileage (254k), constant AC leakage so we have to recharge it periodically. 

With all that said, which EVs would it be best for our commute. One that will last us a while. I’m worried about battery deterioration with the amount of mileage we drive. "

Model Y a valid option?
Hello everyone.  New to Teslas and looking into them.  Plenty of EV experience though.  Trying to see what the deal is.

Some people seem to love these, and then others say they will break down all the time and kill your family (wheel issue?).

Trying to figure it all out because the Model Y seems like a great price right now.  The range and features are great.  And idk, I can't really find anything comparable that's close enough.

There's also the fact the Musk is, let's say, questionable, as a person, and while I don't normally take stuff like that into account for a purchase like this, he is hard to ignore.

Would love to hear from you all, for or against the car/company.  If you're against it, what did you feel was the better option over the Model Y?

Recommended used electric cars 
We just sold our 2015 Leaf to a local dealer because it had a recurring issue with the ABS we can’t afford to keep fixing. We feel like we just got unlucky with it because I’ve done all kinds of research and can’t find any evidence that it’s something common to electric cars. We want to get a replacement one, my husband LOVES having an electric car but not sure which to go with. We don’t want to go new, and there aren’t many options for used where we live, we are likely going to have to buy one with Carmax or Carvana and have it shipped in. I’m doing research but thought I’d ask, which cars do you all recommend? What years/brands to avoid? I’m hearing bad things about the Bolt, is it as bad as it seems?

First long drive
First long trip with my 2023 ID4 ProS AWD.

Langley (east of Vancouver) BC to Jasper AB.

760km each way.
Snow tires at 44psi.
Mountain highway, winter conditions.
22.9kWhr/100 km there
21.9kWhr/100km back.

Temps from 5 deg C to -23 deg C to Jasper, snow on highway 5 through the snow shed, clear to Blue River, snow and slippery sections from Blue River to Jasper (200km). Speeds from 110km/hr to 30km/hr (20 km section that was high gloss hard pack snow with very limited traction).

Temps from -17 deg C to 8 deg C return trip, snow from Jasper to Blue River then clear the remaining trip. Speeds from 70km/hr to 120km/hr.

Cost to charge to Jasper $18.81.
Cost for return $11.51.
Charging at Jasper, free at very slow station at Forest Park Hotel (there for 5 nights so OK).

Comments:

BC Hydro level 3 stations at Blue River and Valemount are painfully slow (50kW stations maxed at 44kW).
Total time spent charging when not in washroom or eating: trip to Jasper 45min as I charged more than needed due to weather conditions (could have skipped Valemount station). Return 20 minutes at Blue River (first stop after leaving Jasper), next stop was Kamloops when I stopped for lunch, charging was completed prior to finishing sushi lunch (Arigoto Sushi a 2 min walk from the EC station in Kamloops, highly recommend). Next was a quick charge (10 minutes) in hope while I grabbed coffee at Blue Moose less than a block away (another recommended place).

The ID4 preformed flawlessly, only time I had traction issues was on the 20 km section after Valemount, which only studded tires or chains would have been better. Even then the vehicle never left the lane I was travelling in (can’t say the same for many other vehicles, AWD, 4WD, semi-truck or other all off the side of the roads). Forgot to turn on the advanced traction control on the return trip and didn’t even notice. 
Love the plug and charge available at EC stations. Only had issues with 2 stations on the way up and 1 station on the way down. (BC hydro in hope wouldn’t start and 100kW BC hydro station in Valemount was off line. 1 EC station in Kamloops didn’t want to start, other 3 functioning though). Had to wait for an open station at EC in hope for less than 2 minutes.

Will be doing similar trips again without hesitation. Hopefully with the all season tires and better weather though.

If you have a question on this trip, please post and I will answer as accurately as I can."

Which EV should I buy between those three? (living in Belgium)
Hey all,

I am a woman in my early 30s and time has come for me to buy my first ''real'' car, and I want an electric one. I am a freelance doctor so money is not an issue. I can not decide between these three so I want your opinion!

My ''love at first sight'' is the **Renault Megane E-tech (Iconic version).** I am absolutely in love with this car, from the moment I saw it. I absolutely love the design of it, and the interior. I've watched all videos possible about it, experts confirm that it is a good car, very good infotainment system, premium cabin,quiet. It is absolutely the car that catches my eye everywhere I see it. Took it for a test drive, the middle spec one. My impression was that indeed I could tell that it is not a premium car (at least the mid spec trim), but I still liked it. Driving was nice, as an electric drive is, but it's a shame there isn't one pedal drive. The driving modes aren't anything special. It felt very light to drive. The major con is that it doesn't have an extended battery version. If I buy it, I will choose the high spec trim for a more premium feeling, but I am aware it is still a ''general audience'' car. Being a doctor, my surroundings don't really advise it.

My second choice is of course **Tesla Model 3.** I am aware that this one beats all rivals in this price tag. I like the design, it's more luxurious as a sport's car, more eye turner, even though here in Belgium it is getting very very popular and doesn't surprise anyone anymore. My family has this car, so I am already used to it's interior, can't say I am impressed by the all minimal look. It does feel more spacious than compact SUVs, but it feels quite big for me and my needs. Driving was nice, but very firm. The steering wheel has an amazing feeling. Driving position feels a bit low to me, I am a small woman so I would have preferred a SUV like car. Now this car normally would not be my choice, but as all EV aficionados say, it is the best in all categories, it is luxurious and feels like an accomplishment car. I have fantasized about arriving to events in this one, I won't lie, it gives you the status and feeling that only premium berlines do. Also, all comparative videos that I have seen seem to agree that it has the best range and battery capacity and consumption from all. Everybody says I will regret not choosing this one.

My third is choice is the all new **Volvo EX30.** This one feels like a good compromise, it's a compact SUV with premium qualities and minimal looks, loyal to the Scandinavian brand. There is also something trustworthy about Volvo. I am not a big fun of the exterior design, it looks nice but a bit blunt in my opinion. The interior is also ok, it does feel more premium than mid spec Renault, I especially liked the doors and seats, I loved the quality. Driving was absolutely amazing, it was firm but the steering wheel had a light touch, it felt so natural like it becomes one with my body, easily the best drive compare to the two others. It was exceptional. Mid spec trim is fine for this car, price a bit high but it can do.

These were my opinions about the three cars. Normally, I would have opted for the Renault, I am fan of this car since a long time and is definitely the most good looking for me. I think I am not going to regret it if I buy it, I actually feel like betraying myself and all the time I have invested in it if I don't. Volvo has the best driving feeling and it feels the most secure choice, being a premium and loyal brand. As for Tesla, it's a luxurious car, all my colleges have it, everyone is advising it, its hard to just ignore it.

What do you think? "

Did the unknown long-term costs or eventual battery replacement costs make you hesitant to jump to EV?
Serious question. I am in the market for my first EV. I love the Ioniq 5, Kona, and XC40 Recharge. I would buy one tomorrow if I could find a local dealer that actually had one on the lot. I'm looking at spending 35K so I will most likely need to go used, and I can find all of them through Carmax, Carsense, etc... but I am hesitant to purchase used from a third-party dealer. Mainly because I am struggling to understand how the warranty would work when things go wrong.

I was watching the Ioniq Guy youtube channel and he mentioned never purchasing an EV from a third-party used dealer, specifically because EVs are a relatively new technology and should something go wrong down the line you will want that CPO dealer warranty. Obviously I would want to carfax any EV I purchased to make sure its not a dealer buy-back or lemon. 

Has anyone in here purchased a used car from a used dealer like Carmax or CarGuru? What was your experience? Did the dealer warranty transfer with the car?

Also, for those of you who keep your vehicles for a long time, does the cost of an eventual battery replacement concern you? I know costs are coming down, but Ive seen replacement costs be anywhere from $15k - $70k. That's a big red flag for me. Even if my car was paid off at that point, it feels like it would be worth nothing other than the salvage price if the battery died. That's a boatload of cash invested in something that would eventually have next to no worth. I tend to trade cars every 5 years so I dont think its an issue for me, but it would definitely make me feel like the clock was ticking once Ive had it a few years.

Sorry for all the questions. I am really struggling with this decision. I am new to the EV world and still doing a ton of research. I really value the opinions and insights of other EV owners. Thank you!"

MG 5SWEV issues
Hi, our MG 5 SW EV is in for a service because of a few issues. A window seal seems to be misaligned, the headlights appear to be not set correctly and the radio stations keep losing their correct names. Had anybody else had issues similar to this?
How long should this take too fix?"

Toping up/charging the 12v car battery, do you do it and why?
Hello everyone,

I know that all EVs recharge the 12v battery automatically, but do you feel like it's a good idea to top it up using a car battery charger (once a month or so) or does that not make sense or is it even potentially harmful to the lifespan of the 12v battery?

I read that most EVs recharge the 12v battery very often, and that the battery is quite different than the one in regular cars, but my issue is if the car is only driven in the city and for short distances.

Also, some recommend to not connect the negative pole of the charger to the batteries negative pole, rather to the car chassis 

Thank you for the answers."

help please
 

Hi fellow EV enthusiasts,

I'm looking to leap into the electric vehicle world with a second-hand car, and I would love your guidance! Our family's daily commute is around 20 miles, with occasional trips ranging from 50 to 200 miles. We need a reliable EV for motorway driving. I am based in UK.

Our budget is under £10k or £200/month. Charging is not an issue as we have a driveway, but I'm unsure about the costs of the charging pod. Additionally, I'm wondering whether to go for a tethered or non-tethered pod.

Any recommendations on reliable second-hand models, insights into charging pod costs, and thoughts on the tethered vs. non-tethered dilemma would be highly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your valuable advice! 🚗⚡️"

My 4 Years of EV ownership
Hey guys and gals, just discovered this group and thought I'd come share my thoughts after 4 years of EV ownership! My name is Eric, I live on Vancouver Island in British Columbia Canada. I'm a EV certified automotive red seal technician, and my 2015 Kia Soul EV + has to be one of the best cars I've owned.

I bought it almost exactly 4 years ago with about 94,000kms from a Mini dealer in Vancouver when I had been living in the area. I had been driving a 1988 Chevrolet Caprice that I spent a lot of time and money on, fixing and restoring it, and had even put in a 370hp SBC crate engine into it (still wasn’t very fast btw). I was starting to get a little bit tired of constantly having to deal with constant old car things like leaky weather strips and the fuel bill. I realized that potential car payments and insurance would be less than it would be to keep fixing and filling the fuel tank on my Caprice.

I started looking at cheap used EVs, and at the time, the only vehicles that were under $20k were the Nissan Leaf, Smart For2 Electrics, Fiat 500e exported from the states, and the Kia Soul. The Fiat didn’t have a warranty as a result of being a vehicle from the states, and the Smart didn’t have DCFC (The Fiat doesn’t have it either). That left the Leaf and the Soul and my only real options. Looking into it, there was a clearly superior vehicle. The Soul, and while info was a bit limited, it looked pretty good. I liked the larger interior space, they were available with heated and ventilated leather (None of the others had this), and had an generous 8 year/160k km warranty. 

I went out searching and ended up buying cheapest one I could find that was close to me, turned out to be perfect. It had a clean title, had the + package (Luxury for the USA), but it was not equipped with a sunroof. I know a lot of people like sunroofs, but I’ve had to clear way too many sunroof drains and quote too many $8k sunroof frame replacement jobs at my dealer job for my comfort. They are the bane of my existence and I pity people that have to pay to fix them.

The vehicle was far from perfect. The car had come from Vancouver Island, and I have the sneaking suspicion that somebody must have been using it as a parcel delivery vehicle because of 2 reasons. Firstly, the vehicle was a little beat up. It has scratches on the hood from somebody dragging the charging cable across it, dents in the door jams from the driver closing the door on the seat belt buckle, and has some broken interior panels. The second reason is that unbeknownst to me at the time (I had very limited EV experience at the time) the high voltage battery was effectively cooked when I got it from the dealer and only had 90km of range. I was okay with all of this given the price of the vehicle.

I had been living in Vancouver at the time, so me and a buddy went on a short trip to Squamish to celebrate my new purchase. Going there wasn’t an issue and we charged there, but heading back we unexpectedly had a 30km range drop, and had to limp to the nearest level 2 charger as there were no level 3 stations within range. We charged it enough to get us to the next level 3 and got home after. 

I took it to the Kia dealer and I had the high voltage battery replaced under warranty for free. However sadly I got the same 27.5 kWh put back in (Oh well, it was free) instead of the 30 kWh packs that some other owners reported getting put in theirs, but I was back in business with 165km range. I was super excited about the range I had just gained, so in addition to using the vehicle exclusively for commuting, but I started slowly pushing the limits of the vehicle and it’s range. I’ve been really good about keeping the battery between 20-80% SOC, but I haven’t exactly been shy of straying and charging to 100% once a week or so. I started using the Torque app combined with imported data PIDS courtesy of APRP on my phone that I connected to the vehicle using an OBD2 dongle I had on hand already and started monitor vehicle status. Battery read 110% SOH at this point in the vehicle’s life.

I ended up having to move to Vancouver Island during the pandemic for a job opportunity, and I’ve been doing a 66km round trip commute 5 days a week for a little over 3 years now, I end up putting about 25,000kms a year on the vehicle (It currently has about 191,000kms), and it’s been pretty good reliability wise. I had to replace the onboard charger (OBC) out of warranty for about $2000 CDN at about 170,000km, but even with a failed on board charger, I was still able to charge the vehicle at a level 3 station as it bypasses the OBC.

The vehicle had aftermarket 16” rims and new tires on it when I bought it, but I ended up damaging the tire on a pothole. The other tires were getting down to about 40%, so I opted to buy a new set of 18” rims and high performance Continental tires for it, and I installed a good set of winter tires on the old rims for winter use later that year. The 18” rims ended up cutting my range by about 25kms, but the range sacrifice was worth it in my opinion.

Not only do I love the looks of them, but the handling of the vehicle is significantly improved. Before I replaced the rims I had taken the vehicle to Vancouver Island Motorsport Circuit through the company I was working for at the time and took it around the track for the afternoon, the biggest limiting factor going around corners turned out to be the tires folding under themselves when going around corners hard. It was honestly really frustrating because I could tell the car had more to give. It had a good amount of body roll, but less than you may expect given then battery placement. But ultimately it was just limited by the tires. That being said, I was actually able to pass a couple Mk7 Golf GTI’s that were running the circuit with me when we got to the corners. And yes I was very nauseous after haha

I ended up driving it from Nanaimo to Prince George late spring last year to see family along a 1,588km round trip, staying in Kamloops overnight to visit other family. I’ve always known the car is more of a city commuter, not a road trip king, but I did the trip just to prove that it could do it. And it did! It however definitely struggled. The new 145km summer range meant I had to stop at 24 total DCFC stations on my entire trip, and we all know if there’s one thing EV batteries don’t like it’s constant fast charging and the heat that comes with it. I ended up learning a bunch of stuff about battery cooling on the vehicle.

I learned that there’s an air intake under both of the front seats that is sucked in my a fan located in the cargo area where the spare would normally be. That air is sucked in and is directed in between the pouch style battery cells (Didn’t know the Soul used this style of battery, all other EVs I know of use laptop style cells) to cool the battery. Cooling the battery this way was Kia’s biggest mistake. Air cooling is not sufficient to cool a battery for multiple DCFC sessions. The first couple charges aren’t too big of a deal, but by the end of the 3rd charge the battery was already above 40°c. It’s at this temperature that the vehicle turns the cooling fan to max and starts dialing back the charge rate, but temps continue to climb with the charge rate being turned down and down as to not damage the EV battery.

So I came up with a partial “Fix”, and that term really does belong in quotations. I turned the A/C to max, directed the air flow to the feet, took a couple old Glosette boxes and modified it so that the rear passenger foot vent air was directed into the battery cooling intakes. But did it work? In a word, sorta. It only was able to bring battery temps down by a couple extra degrees by the next charging station (I needed more like 10°c), but it was able to keep the battery temp from rising as fast compared to before, but ultimately the same result occurred. Was it worth it and would I recommend other Soul EV owners do the same? Absolutely not. It was more of an experiment than anything to see if I could make the journey any easier. What ended up helping the most was reducing the speed at which I drove at on the freeway as to put less of a strain on the EV battery. Despite all of this, I’m glad it had the air cooling. I would imagine the same trip with similar range Leaf and it’s non-cooled battery would  probably have failed to make the trip. But that’s pure speculation.

Fast forward to today on the opposite side of things, we just experienced a cold snap and got temps as cold as -10°c . While not super cold compared for much of Canada, it’s still pretty cold for us here on the island. My battery was reading as low as 0° (My apartment has an underground so it only spend 9 hours outside that day while it was parked at work) and range dipped to about 120km. It’s during this time of year that I get to use one of my favourite features, climate scheduling. I plug in at home and at work, set the timer for when I need to leave, and get into a warm and cozy car. Obviously not as fancy as those of you on here with app connected vehicles, but it’s fine given the age of the vehicle and the fact it doesn’t require a subscription leaves me quite happy.

Now at 190,000kms, it's still managed to maintain 110% SOH. I honestly have no idea how it’s gone almost 100,000kms and it's not only still above the rated comp city, it's maintained it. I’m thrilled honestly. I keep drooling at some of these new EVs, the Polestar 2 really catches my attention. But I keep driving this little Kia trouble free kilometer after trouble free kilometer and it makes me kinda love it and makes me wanna keep it. Even my partner has warmed up to it. He absolutely hated it when he first set his eyes upon it saying he hated the styling, but once he started to drive it and learn why I chose it he started to realize it was a pretty good car. Overall, I’m glad I took the risk. If I had to do it again, I definitely would. 10/10 ownership experience"

Getting my first EV in a few weeks
Im getting a VW ID4 in a few weeks. The two main reasons being that every time I've had car issues it's been engine related (the latest being my cam timing chain snapping, and almost writing off my entire engine, been hit with a £9000 bill for a full engine replacement. Thankfully an extended warranty that I took out will cover it) and I get free charging at work. 

One question I have (for now), can I charge it at home without a wall charger? I'm in the UK, so it's 230v 13a mains. I'm not planning on getting a charger installed yet as I live in a rented house until much later on in the year, so I don't really want to splash out £1000+ on a charger I can't take with me."

Hi all,

My husband and I found a deal on a Polestar 2 2022 with 101K miles on it. Are there any worrying consequences on an electric car that has been driven 50K+ miles per year? How would it affect battery life and are there any other issues we should be aware of?

Making Electric Charging Stations More Useful
Hi all, 

I am not a big reddit user (as you can tell), but I wanted to get some market data for a business I am in the process of starting. 

I am a proud owner of an EV (BMW i4, beautiful car) and live in the city. This means that I, like many others, constantly find myself at charging stations.

I dread having to do this. For me, the thought of sitting in my car for 30-40 minutes at a time with nothing but my phone is painful, and something I avoid when I can (my parents have an EV in the burbs, so I go to theirs often to charge). 

I am assuming others have this problem as well, and I thought to myself, ""what is the best way to solve this issue?""

My thought (and now my business): Air pumps and air vacuums. My business installs these at EV stations, next to the chargers, so people can clean their car and put air in their tires while they wait. You're going to be sitting there anyway, why not do something productive?

I am trying to collect reactions (either positive or negative) for a presentation I am giving. If you have an EV, do you see yourself using this? Why or why not? Would you pay a few bucks to clean your car or put air in your tires? 

&#x200B;

Thank you all!

PS, you may see this on another forum, feel free to say hi twice!"

Charging help needed
Hello all, I’m posting here as my googling the issue is leaving me more confused than I was prior. I feel this should be easy, but I have a standard Chevy Volt basic charger, I moved in to an apartment with a four pronged electric vehicle charger, as opposed to the standard outlet I’ve been using, what’s the cheapest way to connect this to my Volt?

Please recommend an electric car charging cable/box (or ones to avoid)
I'm looking for advice from people that install chargers or otherwise have experience with a variety of chargers. I'm in the US. I'm looking at getting probably a Chevy Bolt. I've got a 240V 50A socket. Besides the usual stuff, I have two somewhat specific needs:

\-It will be mounted exterior, so I'm looking for some amount of durability. I think it's going to take morning sun every day. Alternatively, I'd take suggestions for a box to mount over the unit as a sun shield and for security. Or maybe some sort of UV resistant coating?  Just spitballing. It's on the opposite side of the building from most of wind/rain so water protection isn't as big of an issue.

\-It will be far from home wifi, and I don't want to bother with extenders, so it needs to operate without that feature.  Bluetooth or some sort of local wifi to mobile devices is ok. It doesn't need to have software bells and whistles, at most I would just want 'start charging after such and such time after peak hours' but even that isn't necessary.

Hello everyone,

I am planning to buy the Aion Y car from GAC. It is a new car in Jordan, and I want to know if there are any known issues with it from owners in other countries.

My main concern is about the roof of the car. It is a panoramic roof, which means that there is no solid roof. I am worried about whether this will cause problems if the car is parked under the sun or in heavy rain.

Saudi Arabia’s SNB Capital picks up stake in South Korean battery maker for $100m


has been increasing its focus on the EV industry, with sovereign wealth fund, the Public Investment Fund, investing heavily in electric car maker Lucid.

In June, Lucid Group said it planned to raise about $3 billion through a stock offering, with the majority of that coming from the PIF.

The PIF, which owns about 60.5 per cent of Lucid, agreed to purchase more than 265 million shares of the car maker's common stock in a private placement for about $1.8 billion, Lucid said at the time.

The fund first bought into Lucid in 2018, investing $1 billion in the Tesla rival. In February 2021, the PIF, US investment firm BlackRock and others poured an additional $2.5 billion into Lucid.

Last year, Lucid chairman Andrew Liveris said the company planned to build a factory in Saudi Arabia by 2025 or 2026.

SNB Capital is the largest asset manager in the kingdom, with 230.4 billion Saudi riyals ($61.42 billion) of assets under management as of December 2022.

Last year, Moody's Investors Service assigned “A3"" long-term issuer ratings to SNB Capital, with a stable outlook, citing a “high level of support” from Saudi National Bank, in its first rating of the company.

The agency also issued a “P-2"" rating to SNB Capital's commercial paper under the Global Scale Rating, with an overall stable outlook.

Mustang Mach E battery and software feedback? // car purchase decisions
background: I currently share a 2019 Model 3 that I am giving up in a separation. I have a Tesla wall charger installed in my garage so can charge for more or less “free” at home. I live in a major city and use a car almost daily but mostly for short distances — very rarely on a road trip and almost never have a need to use public chargers with the current Tesla. 

Desire: I am currently looking at a variety of EV options and hoping to buy asap given some incredible Fourth of July week deals I’ve found. Ideally looking under ~55K and am hoping to finance, although only at extremely appealing interest rates. :) I would consider sticking with Tesla but their lack of any financing deals makes it a tough sell for me. I’ve test driven new Chevy Bolt EV and EUV, Mustang Mach E, Kia EV & Niro, and Hyundai Ioniq 5 & 6; and in the used department, I’ve tried the 2022 Volvo XC40 and a 2022 Model Y. 

Much to my surprise, I am leaning toward the Mustang Mach E for a variety of reasons. However, a few things holding me back are the following:
1) battery recharge time: a few of the others in the mix (the Kias and the Hyundais) have lightning fast recharge speeds (80% in 18 min which is quite increíble!). The Mach e is 80% in 45 minutes which seems so slow compared to these and just in general. Honestly this doesn’t bother me much in practice as it’s so rare I am charging publicly and usually just charge overnight at home. I worry more about it for resale value, wondering if such a slow charge will be obsolete in a few years. Thoughts?
2) some of the tech integrations are a major selling point for me on the Ford. I LOVE being able to use the app vs a key with the Tesla and would really love to retain this ability as I am very prone to losing keys and just hate having to carry around a bulky fob vs just my phone. It seems ford is one of the few to actually have this capability with their app but I have read mixed things on how the app can be glitchy or unreliable. Any other real world thoughts on this?

Other than these questions I think this is a very good car option for me. I just like the overall interior feel, I am tall and I like the height the seat is at, I love the front and rear trunk space, backseat spaciousness, luxe interior feel, usbc port, proximity of the dealer/service to my house, and the fact that it just feels like a “fun” car. 

The Ioniq 5 is also in the mix mainly due to an absolutely incredible 0 down, 0.99-1.49 APR (variance based on length of term) I can get on it which truly cannot be beat. However, I went into the drive expecting to be absolutely floored given all the incredible reviews but really just didn’t feel excited about this car for some reason, and lots of small things just irked me (wired Apple CarPlay using a usb-A cable seems insane on a nearly 60k new, modern car; having to have the key fob at all times; no real front trunk; just not loving the look of the interior; and hating the flush door handles on this (and the kias and Tesla…all my friends complain about the handles every time they ride in my car). It’s still in the mix because it’s such a good deal and I think I can get over those things but I was not over the moon by any means.

The Mach E also has some good financing deals with 2.99% and the dealer is willing to cover the difference in the Hyundai interest, so an extra ~2k off. Plus a $3000 ford rebate. Plus the $3750 govt tax credit. Plus I think I can probably get at least another 1k off or some equivalent incentive. Overall I just really felt good In this car and found it most comfortable (possibly because it feels the most similar to a Tesla with the screen setup so it may just feel the most familiar). 

Anyway! This is very long but I found minimal answers on this forum about Mach e’s and am just curious if anyone has some more real world thoughts on the two issues above.  I am trying to buy this week hopefully and driving myself crazy thinking about this so appreciate others thoughts. :)"

Charging electric cars while parked on residential street
I see electric car owners charging their cars frequently while the cars are parked in street. They run the extension cords over the sidewalk and to reach the parked car

I'm curious if anybody has done this with or without issues with parking enforcement.

I have one level 2 charger and plan to install a second one. I will be able to use the second one from my driveway, but occasionally I may want to park in the street. I'm going to install a 4"" PVC pipe underground from the charger to the parkway so that the cable is not obstructing the sidewalk while I'm charging the car."

My open warning about prospective Tesla buyers
(I had posted this elsewhere but am cross posting it here).

I made some recent mistakes.

Mistake 1: I bought the enhanced autopilot for $6000 on my new Model Y.

If you are going to get a Tesla, don't buy it. Just don't. At the very least, you can rent it on a monthly subscription that you can cancel anytime. The only thing it does over the standard autopilot is it has this click to change lane feature. Neat, but not worth $6000. No, there is no auto-park, with it anymore. Nor is there a summons feature anymore. Maybe they will come back. Maybe they will not.

Also Tesla, if someone pays an extra $6000 for an enhanced autopilot, how about one that DOESN'T ACTIVATE THE FUCKING WIPERS EVERY TIME. In autopilot, Tesla requires that the wipers be in auto. Of course, on a clear, dry windshield, auto should be equivalent to off. Sadly, that doesn't seem to be the case on mine. I called support and they simply said ""this is a known issue. There is no ETA for a fix."" No refunds allowed on the autopilot.

Mistake 2: I bought a Tesla. Don't get me wrong, there are a number of things I love about the car. But, combines with the wiper issue, and the fact that occasionally (and I mean at least every other day on my work commute) the car chooses to drastically decelerate when on autopilot. That's just downright dangerous.

I had some minor gripes about some other things they told me would be included but are not.

But I still wanted some sort of venue to air my grievances and suggest that maybe people who want a smart electric vehicle shouldn't pay to become Tesla beta-testers.

I wish I had waited to test drive an Ariya or something like that. My 5 year old Nissan's auto pilot was better than the Tesla's is right now.

Follow up: based on comments from another posting, comments which at *least* gave advice beyond ""wait for a software bug fix"" that Tesla gave me, the problem still exists.  Also, someone (or some bot) downvoted it, well, from 10 to 0.  I don't care about karma, but I do want exposure on this.  I find interesting that either a bot sought out such a post to downvote it, or there are just some Tesla fans that are unwilling to acknowledge the faults in the product (that may or may not exist for you) and the total apathy and lack of support from Tesla.

I have learned an expensive lesson so you all don't have to."

Car buying guide: Volvo XC90 vs Tesla Model X
I was in the market for a seven seater SUV last year and ended up with a 2022 Volvo XC90 T8 recharge. Absolutely love the creature comforts of the car and the ride quality. Since it’s a hybrid, the battery pack gives me 35 miles on a full charge which is plenty for local errands. 

However, I miss the sporty driving of my previous car (Alfa Romeo Stelvio Quadrifoglio) and this has me wanting for more despite the Volvo checking all the boxes.

By chance, I happened to test drive a 2023 Tesla Model X (7 seater) yesterday and absolutely loved it. With Tesla lowering the prices of their Model X by almost $7500, I’m tempted to pull the plug and switch. 

Need help in deciding. Any suggestions or advice would be appreciated.

For context, my trust in EVs and the age old ‘range issue’ has increased ever since we bought my wife an i4 so the EV charging is a non-issue for my family."

2023 Audi Q4 etron vs. 2023 Volvo xc40 Recharge
Hi! I am having a really hard time deciding between the 2023 Audi Q4 etron and the 2023 Volvo xc40 recharge. 

I've seen other similar posts here on Reddit but curious if anyone here owns either of the 2023 models as most of the related posts are from 2021. 

Does anyone here own either car and if yes, have you had any issues? I hear there are a lot of software and operating issues with Audi in general but I am not thrilled about the Volvo's range. Any advice is welcomed!"

Charging Instantly Flips Breaker
Anyone else had a similar issues or knows what is happening here.  I have a Grizzl-e Classic that has worked well for just over a year.  At some point during the night the breaker tripped while charging my EV6.  When I turned the breaker back on the Grizzl-e would give me 3 red beeps.  The error code in the manual says that is a power relay issue.  I contacted Grizzl-e and they sent me a new unit.

After installing the new unit and getting the blue indicator I went to charge the car again.  Breaker flipped as soon as the car went to pull power.  The new Grizzl-e is now giving the 3 red beeps again.

Even worst though the car is now giving me a Check Electric Vehicle System warning and a Low 12V Warning.  I'm not sure I believe the warnings.  I think the software has likely glitched out due to the failed charge.

Since the first breaker flip I have been able to use a 50kwh and 150kwh DC charger.

I'm waiting for an electrician to come and inspect the NEMA plug, 50amp breaker and wiring, but if those check out ok I have no idea what is going on.  The car wouldn't be malfunctioning and asking for to much power would it?  My only thought on this would be something is wrong with the AC to DC convertor in the car."

Does power company only providing power to charger 8 hours a day cause issues for chargers?
Hello there! In the near future I plan to get a car charger installed and then purchase an electric vehicle hopefully not long after that. Our electric utility offers an off peak charging program where we get a nice break in the cost of power @ $0.068 a KWH in the summer months and $0.058 the rest of the year. One of the requirements is that they control power to the charger by turning it on for 8 hours a night and cutting the power the remaining 16 hours in a day.  

My question is this: Does having the charger powered off for 16 hours a day cause issues with programing? Is this a normal thing where Electric companies cut off all power to chargers most of the day? I'm looking at getting a Charpoint charger, but am concerned it would cause issues with it being ""turned off"" most of the day. I wouldn't want it resetting to the default 16 amps every night. Am I over thinking things or is this a legitimate concern? If it is a concern, what sort of ""dumb"" charger would work well?"

What is the actual warranty law for electric vehicle batteries in California?
I am looking for information on actual warranty law in California is and how it applies to a 2014 all electric BMW i3. I am getting confusing and conflicting information with regards to CARB applicability due to the car being 100% electric. I am also confused about BEV (Battery Electric Vehicle) and PZEV (Partial Zero Emission Vehicle) with regards to how my vehicle is classified and what the implications of this classification is. Finally, what was the law in 2014 when the car was originally first sold? I'm assuming the current laws only apply to vehicles sold after the law was passed.

My 2014 is bricked due to a component inside the battery pack malfunctioning. Technically speaking they are saying it's not an issue with the actual battery cells which may be relevant. I am being told by the dealer the warranty was up 8yrs from the sale date which was about a year ago in mid 2022. I want to make absolutely sure this is the case before my car goes to ewaste. Thank you!"

TuSimple: FAQ for Getting Payment on the $189M Investor Settlement
Hey guys, I posted about this settlement before, but since they’re still accepting late claims, I decided to share it again with a little FAQ.



If you don’t remember, in October 2022, WSJ reported TuSimple was under FBI, SEC, and CFIUS probes for issues with Chinese startup Hydron. Things escalated with potential espionage charges, CEO Hou’s resignation, and a whistleblower’s video exposing safety problems from a truck crash. Following this news, $TSPH significantly fell, and TuSimple faced a lawsuit from investors.



The good news is that Tusimple settled $189M with shareholders, and they’re still accepting late claims.



So here is a little FAQ for this settlement:     



Q. Who can claim this settlement?



A. All persons who purchased or otherwise acquired TuSimple securities between April 15, 2021, and December 20, 2022, inclusive.



Q. Do I need to sell/lose my shares to get this settlement?



A. No, if you have purchased $TSPH during the class period, you are eligible to participate.



Q. How much money do I get per share?



A. The final payout amount depends on your specific trades and the number of investors participating in the settlement.



If 100% of investors file their claims - the average payout will be $0.62 per share. Although typically only 25% of investors file claims, in this case, the average recovery will be $2.48 per share.



Q. How long does the payout process take?



A. It typically takes 4 to 9 months after the claim deadline for payouts to be processed, depending on the court and settlement administration.



You can check if you are eligible and file a claim here: [https://11th.com/cases/tusimple-investor-settlement](https://11th.com/cases/tusimple-investor-settlement) "

Los Angeles Apartment Renters with EVs and PHEVs
Trying to get a sense of what life is like if you can't charge at home. I saw a similar post about this, but wanted to get more specific.

I'm curious about the property you live on, and if you've tried talking to your landlord about getting a circuit run to your parking spot (if you even have one). I'm hoping to lead an initiative to solve this problem, starting in Los Angeles, but first I need to fully understand it.

Details on your situation, building, tenant parking, and current charging solution would be great. Complaints also welcome. "

Any Evs as reliable as a Toyota?
Hey so I really want an Ev,mainly to camp and live in it due to constant climate control. I want a car that has no trouble reaching 300,400k maintenance. I think any car build today should reach at a bare minimum 200,250k trouble free miles or its junk.

I'm also looking at Prius primes (plug ins) . They seem to reach 300,400, even 500k miles with barely any issues whatsoever.Break replacements every 250k miles. carcarenut has a video of a prime with 360k miles and he says its flawless and looks like a car with 20-30k miles. that same person now has around 500k miles and just now needed to do a 1k repair ,first one. 

Buut the prime is just too small for camping with the battery taking up most of the boot. For the same money the Id4 is so much more spacious and nicer.

People mention evs save money on maintenance but that only seems to be true if you compare them to American and European cars which are mostly junk,not when compared to Toyota or Honda.

Its just so frustrating because I've done weeks of research ,spend dozens of hours reading,and for every Ev i read Theres some sort of teething issues. Tesla heat pumps keep failing every winter over and over, $4k repair each time . Also Tesla AC's keep failing which I've never heard of happening in a Toyota and the cost can also be 4,5k just for the AC. 2021 Tesla batteries fail. VW id4 software,battery modules and front drive motors fail. Also water pumps. Which sucks because I really like the id4. Mach e hvbjc fails, sometimes even after replacement. ioniq 5 and ev6 iccu keep failing,bricking the car and causing a $10k repair out of warranty. also even when replaced under recall work, the replacements still fail and the recall only covers the first replacement .

The problem is out of warranty these repairs are massively costly ,like 5k plus up to 20k. no third party shop options.  People say oh don't worry it's all covered by warranty,which is simply not acceptable. especially when I'm looking at used cars that are already almost out of warranty and I plan to put massive miles on. Your average Toyota is extremely unlikely to ever need massive repairs like this. I'm not even mentioning the smaller issues and repairs like door handles or air suspension in used model s's(5k cost) because air suspension is unreliable in any car except Lexus.

Is there any Ev out there that can compete with a Toyota? I'm only looking at Evs due to their camping ability. no home charging so sadly I'd have to pay the equivalent of 25mpg in my state for charging due to cheap gas. But I could try to use free public chargers at night when camping.

I really do want an EV despite trashing them. I think their the future and their very smooth and ideal for camping. But I also really want something I don't have to worry about.

I think deep down I have anxiety and a hard time trusting any car not made by the Japanese. They seem like the only people in the world who know how to properly build a car. I wish so badly that Toyota had competitive EVs. thought id also kill for a Chinese Ev, they seem amazing. BYD might be the new Toyota if their cars hold up."

Cost to fuel an EV in Connecticut?
We are shopping around for a new car and I can't decide between a full EV, a PHEV, or a traditional hybrid. We are on an extremely tight budget and need to choose based strictly on complete cost (purchase price, cost to insure, cost to maintain, cost to fuel, etc). Our income makes us eligible for the tax rebates, though I think we could only afford a used vehicle, unless there are some crazy incentives for new vehicles that I don't know about. We live in central Connecticut, and I'm hoping some local people could share their experience.

Gasoline prices around here are generally on the mid to lower side compared to national averages, but the electricity rates are the highest in the country. I know Eversource (our electricity supplier) offers reduced rates for off-peak charging, but that requires investing in an approved charger, which are kind of pricey.

We would charge almost exclusively at home, because we live in a semi-rural area and there are no charging stations. This isn't really a problem because it's a small state, however, if we went on a longer trip, we might struggle to find charging stations, but I don't really know. We go on longer trips 4-5 times a year, generally in New England but we drive to Florida or NC about once/twice a year. We aren't the type to sit around waiting for a charge (on long trips we like to power through, normally eat while driving and just stop for gas, and drive 12 hours or more in one day).

What are you experiences? Living in CT, are there substantial savings with an EV, or not? Is finding a charger on long trips going to be too much of a hassle, especially with two impatient kids?"

The problem with EVs at chargers not charging
Today I witnessed it first hand why it happened. 

I plugged in at an EA charger at a Fred Meyer right next to a woman fiddling around at the charger with her EV6.

I plugged in, swiped in the app and started charging, no issues. I always use the app and never had issue starting the charge (not counting slow sessions, sessions that the charger didn't accept or stopped right away). So I'm saying, STARTING a session has never been a problem through the app.

I asked the lady if she had problems and she said she always has problems. I cautiously asked if she's using the app because it never gave me any problems. She's like: no, I use my credit card. I told her that the cc readers are not very good. She said, well, I don't even know my login for the app. Then said this is too bothersome, I'm just going to do my shopping running away annoyed. She just left the car in the parking spot.

I wanted to say something but she stormed away so quick I was perplexed.

So, the problem is not the charger, or the app. It's the user that cannot be bothered to actually set up their app correctly and know how to use it. It's not EAs fault. Totally user fault!"

Is an EV right for me? Would love some input!

My daughter will start driving soon and will inherit my current ride, a 2009 Ford Edge with a newly rebuilt transmission. I'm ready for a new ride and having a really hard time figuring out what to get, which has led me here.

My average daily drive is 10 to 40 miles round trip. Road trips or long drives would be done in my husband's hybrid,  so finding somewhere to charge isn'tan issue. I need an SUV as we have our own pottery business and I have to be able to move a lot of product in plastic totes in my car regularly.

Adding a charger at home would be easy as we already have a 220 outlet in our garage for our pottery kiln.

My questions are:
Can I charge outside only? I can't park in the garage due to the above-mentioned pottery.  I live in Fort Worth, TX so it's not like it rains often, but would this be a problem?

What to get? My new car budget is $50k. I'd love a Genesis, but they're out of reach unless I go used. Tesla is not an option. I'm really intrigued by the Volvo EX30 and probably like the look of it more than any of the other options, but didn't see Android Auto or ventilated seats (it gets hot here!) listed as features.

I've read good and bad things about the Hyundai Ioniq 5, but I really don't like the look of them... the Mustang Mach E looks okay? I honestly don't know what to look for and haven't been wowed by any. I wish Tesla wasn't... Tesla, ya know?

New to EVs, considering my first one
Hello guys!
My next car is going to be a used EV, i've made up my mind about that already. But I have a few questions.
I commute 62 miles (100km) round trip to work every day, and 95% of that is on the highway at 68 mph (110kmh). I can cut this down to 50 miles (80km) with 30% city 70% highway in the winter if needed. My fuel costs are through the roof (4000 usd on just fuel yearly, oil changes, filters, sensors, fluids, etc) with my current car which is a Volvo S60 2.4t automatic. I will not get another cheaper car, I want to stay comfortable and have power if needed. I want to get an EV to cut down on this and save money in the long run. If I like my EV i might even sell my current ICE after half a year. I have solar at home, so I could do level 2 charging (240v is level 2 right?) at 3.3kw from solar purely, or 6.2kw from solar+grid as my inverter can do power assist. I will very rarely if ever use a quick charger.
Things to consider: 
-I live in central Europe, close to the balkans. The summers here are long (4-6 months) and hot (ambient temperature can be from 86f/30c up to 100f/36c)
- I will have to take out a loan for sure. Can pay about 50% of the car in cash

Now the questions: 
Do I need a liquid cooled battery car for these temperatures? Is it neccesary?
I will need a 50kwh car minimum right?

I was considering 2 cars:
Opel Corsa E, 50kwh, has liquid cooled battery, would fit my needs. Lots of horror stories about electric traction control problems which anything can cause, and after very costly repairs can ranfomly come back. I dont wanna have to deal with a lot of issues if possible.  And I heard Vauxhall customer service is nonexistent.
I could get one used from 2020 with 25k miles (40k km) for 15.5k dollars. SOH 99%.

Nissan leaf tekna e+ 62kwh.
I like this car a lot more because of the bigger battery, size, and power.
However the battery is air cooled. 
I could get one from 2020 also with 43500 miles (70000km) for 16.5k dollars.  SOH 96%. Is this realistic? Are there any common problems?

Which one should I get and why?"

To which EV should I switch coming from a Model 3 SR+?
I am looking for a new car in Germany (no rush, until mid 2025 maybe, preferrably used) and basically it would be nice if it would be similar to my Model 3 SR+ in efficiency and power, but with these things added:

* ride should be more comfortable
* a little better suited for vacation drives (600-700km). I see this as a combination of efficiency, fast charging capability and battery size
* compatible with a bike rack for 3 bikes, best on a trailer hitch I guess (I did not order it with my M3 2020 because I havent been into Mountainbiking yet at the time)
* heated steering wheel (available in current Model 3s)
* a better trunk opening / more usable trunk

I used some filter on ev database (where it is impossible to filter for usable trunk and comfortable ride of course):

Ioniq 6 seems to be the only car to have a better efficiency but a similar trunk problem. Very fast charging, like Hyundai 5 and Kia EV6.

BMW i35 seems a bit overpriced and has underwhelming fastcharging.

ID7 would be nice I think, more expensive and bigger than I would like / need.

ID4 or Enyaq could be an option, though I do not prefer SUVs. Probably the best chance to get a good used deal though here in Germany. Enyaq felt more comfortable but very dull (steering, power output) compared to my Model 3 during a test drive in I think 2023.

I don't know about Ford Explorer or Capri. Just don't seem to stand out in any category?

EV3 seems like a good deal but not that fast charging.

ID3 would feel like quite a downgrade I think?

No Tesla again as long as Musk is their CEO."

No Garage AND Anxiety - Is an Electric Car for Me?
Hello /r/electriccars! I am considering an electric car, but have 2 seperate issues I can't imagine are that uncommon, so I'm wondering if anyone has advice. 

First is logistical - the house I will be moving to shortly does not have a garage, will that be a problem? I guess we would have to install a charging outlet on the side of the house nearest the driveway. Would it need to be protected from rain/snow? Could it short out or anything being exposed to the elements? Will this be a problem?

Second - I have pretty bad anxiety about a lot of stuff. Running out of fuel is a nightmare scenario for me. If my car gets under 1/3 tank of gas I start getting nervous and need to fill up immediately. Where I will be moving to (Boston, USA area) should have plenty of chargers, I assume, but I'm worried I will always be concerned about where is the closest charger, what if it is occupied or not working when I get there, will I end up being late because I have to drive around looking for a charge, etc. A roadtrip feels like an impossibility due to this anxiety, too. Gas is easy, there are stations everywhere. Does anyone else have anxiety about this? Have you found any way to mitigate it? Is it really a non-issue and I'm anxious about nothing(not the first time for that lol!)?

Any thoughts or input much appreciated!

Best electric SUV 2024. Range, interior design and efficiency
Hi ElectricCars!

I'm looking for advice. So far, my electric SUV research has taken up a lot of time, and the more time passes, the more questions I have.   
  
Let's start with a few exclusions:  
- after test-driving most, I am not a huge fan of Kia and Hyunday's EVs. They are OK cars, but they lack that premium feel, and I am looking for   
a) something a bit bigger that can fit a family of 4 with two dogs  
b) high-grade interior finish   
c) driving dynamics that are precise and exciting

My best list so far: 

**Genesis GV70**: I love the design, and it's 3.7-second 0- 60 time. However, I am worried about the range. Do you have any experience with this?  
**Audi SQ6 e-Tron**: it's a great car, but for Audi, I had a feeling that the interior of SQ6 is somehow not as nice as gas-powered Audis  
**Polestar 3:** I haven't tested-driven it yet as I have had many problems with my Volvo in the past. Are there any users of Polestar 3 here?   
**Tesla Model X:** I loved it. Its range is great, and the charging infrastructure is amazing, too. However, it's the most expensive one here, and my friends who bought Teslas often complain about sloppy finishing (I saw both nicely fitted Teslas and ones that were scary to look at) servicing the car, even under warranty. 

Nice haves: 

- Autopilot or a really good adaptive cruise control  
- An option to leave the dogs inside with AC on (I'm in Austin, TX)  
- Large (f)trunk  
- Good charging infrastructure

Must haves: 

- Reliable  
- Good service centers 

I'd love to hear your opinion if you own or drive any of these cars or if you have an alternative that you think is worth test driving. 

Thanks! "

Question, EV 12 volt system.
I recently had my 12 volt battery die, my commute is pretty short so it doesn't really get enough time to charge fully I guess, had the same issue with my truck back in the day, took almost 3 years to do it though so that's pretty good I guess. I just had it at the shop, that's where it died actually, and the battery passed their load tests and stuff so its just the charge level I need to worry about atm. I park outdoors so I'm thinking a solar maintainer. Any suggestions that are easy to hook up ? I have a 2020 Kona BEV.

EDIT:

Second question, if I get stranded outside the vehicle, unable to access the hood release, is there a way to jump it in the same vein as a Tesla where you can jump start the electrical system with a 9volt.

EDIT:  
Problem solved for second question. I've been using keyless entry for so long I forgot my doors have a key lock. 😜"

Ford charging at Tesla Supercharger - just BS marketing
Sorry to rant but I have been a Tesla guys since the first roadster. So two years ago I decided to get a Ford Lightning and I love it. The problem is the charging networks outside of Tesla suck. So I was thrilled to hear we can now charge at the same network that is available anywhere. I have done cross country trips with my model S and was looking forward to doing the same with my Lightning. Here is the problem. I can’t get the adapter to let me charge at Tesla Superchargers. Even though I put the order in as soon as I got the email, my adapter won’t arrive until late September. I call Ford and I got “it is what it is” answer. Yet on YouTube you see all these YouTubers with the adapter and showing us how great it is. Tesla is a master at this also. Announce or sell something like the cybertruck and set a delivery date of late 2027. I am a huge supporter of EVs but they have to get the model together. Better alignment of delivery and manufacturing with promises are key to avoid frustration. Frankly I am getting to the point where I am considering going back to ICE - something I have never thought I would say. I believe for EV to truly replace ICE vehicles there needs to be a paradigm shift. Manufacturing and delivering products on a reasonable timeframe is key to create customer satisfy and long term loyalty.

Public charging experience
Hello awesome EV owners! What are the most annoying parts of charging in public?

I’m working on a project to see what the most annoying things are about public charging and whether or not they it is a big enough set of problems worth solving. I personally don’t think waiting around for the actual infrastructure quality to drastically improve feels like the right thing to do. So we need some creative ways to make the public charging experience better.

Please could this wonderful community contribute towards the survey on [https://govolt.io](https://govolt.io) and maybe we can up with a good solution to the sticking points of EV adoption."

Making Electric Charging Stations More Useful
Hi all, 

I am not a big reddit user (as you can tell), but I wanted to get some market data for a business I am in the process of starting. 

I am a proud owner of an EV (BMW i4, beautiful car) and live in the city. This means that I, like many others, constantly find myself at charging stations.

I dread having to do this. For me, the thought of sitting in my car for 30-40 minutes at a time with nothing but my phone is painful, and something I avoid when I can (my parents have an EV in the burbs, so I go to theirs often to charge). 

I am assuming others have this problem as well, and I thought to myself, ""what is the best way to solve this issue?""

My thought (and now my business): Air pumps and air vacuums. My business installs these at EV stations, next to the chargers, so people can clean their car and put air in their tires while they wait. You're going to be sitting there anyway, why not do something productive?

I am trying to collect reactions (either positive or negative) for a presentation I am giving. If you have an EV, do you see yourself using this? Why or why not? Would you pay a few bucks to clean your car or put air in your tires? 

&#x200B;

Thank you all!

&#x200B;

PS, you may see this on another forum, feel free to say hi twice!"

Is Enex-X server offline?
My Juicebox40 decided to stop responding to the app. But, it isn’t an internet problem. At least I can get out to the internet everywhere else. The JB40 is blinking green like it has internet, and is actually charge my car, but I can’t monitor it from the app. 

This seems to happen to me about once every six months. 

Anybody else seeing this? 

The thing that drive me the most batty about this thing is you can’t override the ToU program unless the box can talk to the Enel-X servers. I really wish this thing had an override manual on button."

How does going uphill for long stretches of time affect range?
I'm considering my next car to be electric but I live in the mountains. My commute is a 50km descent, the way back is the same distance back up (total height difference is 800m). I won't be able to charge my car in the city. Most days the total distance traveled is about 120km, but there are days where I drive 200km. Charging the car at home it would have a full battery every morning, but I'm worried the trip home might still be a problem, especially in winter."

EVs in Minnesota
Hello! I need help from EV owners with choosing my next car. No one seems to be able to answer my questions and the market is SO confusing. I’m feeling at such a loss! Here’s my situation.. sorry it’s lengthy!

I live in Minnesota and currently own a 2018 Nissan Leaf that on paper gets 150 miles. With MN winters, a 50 mile total commute that’s 99% highway, and detached garage, the actual range I get is much closer to about 80-90 miles (eco mode). For example, on a cold winter day at full charge, my range starts at ~130 miles, so I’ve already lost miles before driving. I’ve read this is the battery protecting itself and conserving range in the cold. While driving, as soon as I turn on heat, the range decreases ~2 miles for every 1 mile I’m actually driving. Because of this I hardly use the heat 🥶 It’s also dicey to drive anywhere outside of my commute after work. 

For now I’m able to manage, but eventually when my husband and I have kids and need to drive to daycare, etc I don’t think the car will be practical or even safe for my driving needs. I stuck it out again this winter, but hoping by next winter I will have a different car. 

I’m hoping to find a car for no more than $43k. It seems that most EVs on the market now have an upper range of ~260 miles (bolt, kona, niro). Based on the efficiency of my Leaf battery, I’m skeptical that  ~100 miles more (on paper) in a slightly larger vehicle is going to give me enough added mileage in the winter. My first question is has the EV battery efficiency in winter improved at all since 2018? This is not something I can determine on a short test drive, and I feel like car salespeoples cannot accurately speak to this question. If I could get an EV with a true range closer to what is on the sticker, I would pay to upgrade to a new EV.

My second option is to buy a PHEV. I’ve done a lot of research and the problem is essentially none are available in MN unless I wait for likely over 1 year for one to “potentially” become available. It sounds like the dealerships are given cars from their manufacturers completely at random and not based on customer requests. This includes the Kia Niro PHEV and Rav4 PHEV. It sounds like the Hyundai Tuscon PHEV isn’t sold in MN, and same with the Surbaru CrossTrek PHEV (which sounds like is being discontinued soon). After siting in the new Prius we’ve decided it’s likely too small for a family car, unfortunately. My PHEV question is, what is even available to buy in Minnesota? Is the only option to buy one in another state? 

If you’ve made it this far - thanks in advance for any suggestions!! I SO appreciate it!"

Another terrible Electrify America experience to add
Went a different route home because I thought it would be faster to charge on a 350kw than the 150kw EvolveNY/Shell one that was more on the way.  I was very, very wrong. 

EA app and plugshare reported that stall 1 was down, and the three 350kw were open. When I arrived, stalls 2 and 3 seemed available and the screens were operational. Stall 1 was down and had an appropriate message. Stall 4 had a vehicle in it. The orientation of the stall screens were very odd too, being to the sides of the parked cars instead of at the head of the space. Stall 2 and 4 screens faced each other with two spaces in between but stall/screen 3 was facing the 4th single, right-most space outward where you would expect stall 4 to be facing. The vehicle that was plugged into stall 4 was in stall 3's spot, making it awkward for me to sandwich myself between the screen a stranger's car that smelled like smoke/ash from the outside. 

Since I have a free charging pass from a vehicle purchase, I had to use my phone to initiate the charge with the EA app. It took at least 2 minutes just to allow the app to start and load through various screens and layers despite having a full 5G connection around 12:30 AM. Once I finally got the map to load and the charger selected, I swiped to start and it kept hanging on initiation and not starting, before the stall told me to unplug and restart the session. I called the number to remotely start the session. 

After a few tries, she couldn't get it to start and had me switch from 2 to 3 with the same results. She tried restarting the stalls (which I couldn't confirm actually shut off and restarted.) She put me on hold at least three times to get help but the suggestions were completely useless like, ""is the car off and unlocked?"" I thought, that's what you put me on hold to come back and suggest?? Keep in mind I've had a headache for hours that had progressed into a migraine at this point. 

After an hour, the smelly, sketchy car left and I tried his stall before the representative could even suggest it. I did the initial thing I tried to do: open the app, select the charger, swipe to initiate. This time, it worked immediately. There was nothing the rep did or said or suggested I couldn't have done on my own and she had no idea what the problem actually was. However, this charger wouldn't go past 77-78kw despite being a 350kw charger being used on a Kia EV6 that supports charging over 200kw with a potential charge time of as little as 18 minutes from 10% to 80%. I was the only one charging.

That is why I was there: to save 20 minutes of time by fast charging here despite a longer route home. I was at 9% so it should have worked when I plugged in, but EA's crappy chargers didn't seem to recognize that the car can charge faster. It has worked in the past at a different location in a different state. I even tried waiting a couple minutes and restarting the charge because I have read that helped someone reach the correct speeds, to no avail.

In the end, it took almost an hour to start a charge that ended up charging SLOWER than the EvolveNY/Shell 150kw charger at Tops in LaGrangeville that I chose to forgo this time. I only spent 10 mins charging enough to get me home despite planning to charge most of the battery in that time using the 350kw nature of the charger. Otherwise what's the point?

EA needs to label that the only reliable charger at this site is charger number 4. Chargers 1-3 are down as far as I'm concerned.

Electrify America needs to get their shit together or they will delay and deter a lot of people moving to EVs.

In an attempt to save some time and charge up more in less time, I ended up adding an hour and a half to a 30 minute drive home.

Due to the exhaustion and migraine, I started getting car sick on the way back and had to pull over and puke on the side of the road. I almost didn't make it home in time before a second puke. It was so bad that today I needed to take a day off to recover from the experience, stinging throat and all. 

Relying on Electrify America is dangerous to your well-being. I would not recommend this location (Walmart in Newburgh) to anyone for a very long time. Be skeptical of any EA charger unless you know it's brand new or recently renovated. Even then..."

Ev, Thoughts?
Let's say a service becomes available for a Portable Car Charger that comes to you if you run out of power. This can be on the side of the road, work, a friends house, or etc... Is there a need for this? How much would you pay for a service like this? Would you prefer that this service does not just work as an on the go charger for your ev (120V charge) but also has the ability to help with problems with your ev. Such as tire replacement or something is not working right. Any thoughts????"

A pretty poor experience with ABRP
I just finished the outbound part of a road trip from Colorado to California and back. I used A Better Route Planner (ABRP) on iPhone, connected to Apple Carplay on my Kia EV6 Wind AWD. Here are some findings:

* On the first part of the trip, I had a UI on the carplay screen that showed current position (moving along the route), the next stop, and details about the upcoming charger.
* After various errors that the app showed, and settings changes that I did, that UI changed to one that didn't show the current position. It only showed the address of the next charger, but no details about it - i.e. no name, not the network or number of chargers or anything. 
* As a result, it was hard to check the status of the upcoming charger(s). If I could have seen what was coming up it would have been easier to check the charger status with the Electrify America app or even the Plugshare app. 
* Not knowing if the upcoming chargers were working led to anxiety
* The app also started to flake out, showing ""sorry, an unexpected error occurred"" and  ""this route is no longer valid""
* Part of the problem was the unpredictability of the EA charging network. At some places it worked flawlessly, and at others it had few if any chargers working. Combined with the inability to even see what was the next charger we were navigating to, this let to uncertainty that we could make it to a back-up charge option, if the intended destination was inoperable. 

The combination of all this was a total loss of trust in what the app was telling us  I decided to also do a more manual routing using Plugshare, with various stops planned as options. I'm not impressed with ABRP. The UI is vague and quite different on a web browser compared to the iPhone app. Also the VERY frequent errors and failures, let me to think I really cannot rely on this app."

Wallbox Pulsar plus and Renault ""ZE ready"" incompatibility
I was about to buy a Wallbox Pulsar Puls to charge my new Renault Twingo ZE, which will arrive next week, and found out that the Eco Smart function is not available for ""ZE ready"" vehicles:

[https://support.wallbox.com/en/knowledge-base/how-to-activate-and-use-eco-smart/](https://support.wallbox.com/en/knowledge-base/how-to-activate-and-use-eco-smart/)

""The Eco-Smart functionality is not available for Renault ZE Ready vehicles.""

Which is a bummer because I was basically buying it only for that function, to use my solar array efficiently for charging.

Strange enough, the do not mention any problem using the Power Boot functionality, which is not to different from an application p.o.v. to the Eco Smart... So this is quite peculiar...

Does anyone have any experience using Renault ""ZE Ready"" vehicles with a Pulsar Plus ?

I wrote to Wallbox inquiring about the problem and I'm waiting for a reply.

Thanks in advance :-)"

Ioniq 5 or Tesla?
Hi there, new to the community.

Absolutely love my Ioniq 2019 and have learned a ton about EVs, how they operate, etc. 

My problem is my battery range. I have the most efficient batter in the market but the problem is it has a range of 124 miles so I have to charge often and stop in places (I'm in OC). But if. I go up to LA I'd really rather not have to find a CCS charger which is why I want to trade my Ioniq in before it hits 60k miles.

Should I go with an Ioniq 5? I'm not much of an SUV person but it would be nice. However my company has a lot of Tesla's and I've been in several of them so they're definitely attractive but I'm not sure if they're for me. Who out there could recommend one over the other and why?"

Quick Change Batteries For Electric Vehicles
I' m becoming more sold on getting an electric vehicle. The thing that I hear most is about charging times and EV charging stations. This is an idea I had to possibly solve many problems with EV batteries, hazardous waste from disposal of batteries and availability of charging stations. I think a very doable thing for electric vehicles to have more options for charging is a quick-change battery swap out station whereas the electric vehicles have standardized designs that allow the owner to pull into an electric battery swap out station using an attendant like the old gas stations that has equipment at a pull up island that removes the battery and replaces it with a fresh charged battery in about 10 minutes. The batteries are then recharged at the station and put back in the next vehicles. It could operate like a gas card that we use and keep funds on or have the option to use it like a charge card for battery swaps. Plus you can also charge at your house or an EV charging station. Maybe this idea has already been explored on this site. If so please share your thoughts."

Some questions about charging an EV
 

Hello everyone! 

For a university project, I need your help. 

I'm gathering some information about charging an EV, and it would be very helpful to me if you could answer these questions. 

Thank you.

1. Have you ever had a problem finding a charging station?

2. Would you use an application to find a charging station?

3. Would you be willing to share information with other users regarding charging stations status on an App? 

4. What kind of services would you like to receive in exchange for your participation? 

5. Would you be open to sharing your private charger (if you have one) with other electric car users in exchange for a fee or discount in public charging stations?"

Portable EV Charger
Hello people of reddit, 

My name is Micah, and I am an Electrical Engineering student at UC Santa Cruz. 

One of my current projects is to design and prototype a portable, self deploying, renewable charging station for EV's, but before we can get the project off the ground we need some input from the public. 

As an outdoors and EV enthusiast, I have often struggled with range issues using an EV on extended camping and backpacking trips. As a senior design project, I have decided to pursue the feasibility of creating a portable, self extending solar array for range extension of electric vehicles when on multiple day stays. 

EV's can lose power when on extended stays away from a charger for a multitude of reasons, including phantom drain, 'always on' features, and use of cabin climate control, to name a few. The aim of this design project would be to create a product capable of reducing range anxiety on stays away from charging infrastructure, without requiring modification to factory specifications of existing vehicles. The final product would be packaged in a rooftop cargo box which could be mounted / removed from any standard automotive roof racks.

Another note on the design: the product could also be used when the vehicle is parked outside of one's home as a way of reducing electricity costs for charging. Additionally, the utility of the product would not be limited to charging EV's, it could also be used, for example, to charge personal devices, power an electric stove, or for off grid living (i.e. Van life).

TL;DR - I'm a student working on designing a portable EV charger and I need public input. Filling out the survey linked below would be a huge help to me.

[Here's a link to a short survey](https://forms.gle/wj2UePhLWe6Lu3sr7) I have prepared to help understand this problem and it's many possible solutions a little more. Feel free to comment any suggestions you have, and I'd be happy to answer questions!

P.S. I made a reddit account for this, I promise I'm real."

Swapping batteries instead of charging ?
Hello electric car enthusiasts , 
I was having an idea , i find that electric cars are really superior to gasoline cars in performance and efficiency nonetheless they still have one major problem if we're out of juice in a gasoline car all we have to do is pull over put some gas and we're good to go in a minute . I was thinking what if we did the same thing with electric  cars . What if we could just have battery packs chargers instead we pull over to our  pack charger replace our existing pack and get another one that is fully charged instantly without having to wait , i know that it would take to completely redesign the whole ecosystem but it would much more convenient . I'm not an expert in elctric that's why i came here to share my idea. Watcha think?"

VW E-Up! 12 volt battery error message
My younger sister is learning to drive and loved the Up! but my dad was doing some long routes and the max range was around 85 miles as she was getting over 5 miles per Kw. When he drive it he usually get 3!

In order to go further my dad bought an ex demonstrator Mii and put the Up! on eBay. He had replaced the battery and was getting an error message about the 12 volt battery and the workshop but ignored it and it didn't seem to be a problem. This error message will generally pop up when starting the car for the first time and then disappear.

He's tried changing the battery on the Mii with the one on the Up! and initially it worked but then the error came back. The battery from the Up! (Varta) is now in the Mii and there are no error messages in the new car.

He's ordered a Yuasa and will see if that does the trick when it arrives. He has a couple of old cars (Renault 10 & Fiat 125S) and keeps their batteries connected to a trickle charger which shows how much charge is in the battery. When fully charged it shows 13.5 volt but when connected to the battery in the Up! it was showing only 11.5 so it has now been on trickle charge for a day and he will be checking it again soon to see if that does the trick.

Very useful to read other people's experiences on here as the main agents hardly ever see these cars and don't really know what to do!

He's tried using an OBD reader and cleared other errors but this one still persists. I've got a mate with access to VCDS so was thinking of giving that a go.

Previous posts on VW forums state that from having VW look at it that one diagnosis is that an electrical control unit needs replacing, at £3000 plus £1000 labour.  £4k being worth a large portion of the car, just wondering if there was another way round it.

Unfortunately, I won't be buying a Hyundai EV. Here's why:
**Update**: So I spoke to the Hyundai Dealer at Mount Gravatt, very polite, apologetic over how things went down, they will have a car ready for a test drive for me ready to go. They are sorry I had a bad experience earlier in the year and would like to make it right. So I'll be test driving the Model 3 then the Ioniq. I'm happy with the outcome so I don't see a need to not let people know there's been an update and that I'm happy with the conversation I had with the dealer and I'm happy with the outcome. They don't know unless people say something. Now they are aware, they have noted how my experience was bad and they say they will endeavour to make sure others don't have the same experience.

So I'm big on conversions personally, I like building my own stuff.

However the wife does not want me monkeying with her daily, that's fine.

So in February we went to a Hyundai Dealer in Brisbane to look at Hyundai's, booked an appointment for 2pm, got there at 1:45, informed them we were there, and at 3pm.we walked out.

Apparantly the people before us bought a Kona Electric and had to be ""sorted out"" and no other salesperson could help us.

The eventually called us at 4pm asking where we were. Not buying from you was basically the answer.

Yesterday we decided to give Hyundai one more shot so drive west of Brisbane to a rural dealership, we were made aware they didn't have any of the BEV models, but we could also go for a drive, get a nice lunch, give me a break from my frustrations over the Conversion I'm doing.

The HEV and PHEV are basically the same car, so for seat comfort and sizing, good enough. A car is a car, the powerplant is a different discussion.

We wanted the feel, the vibe, the Mabo.

Anyway, the salesman's first question was ""Why do you want to go Electric?""

Well to save money

""So you're aware the hybrid is over $10,000 cheaper?""

Yes

""So you want the Hybrid?""

No, I want the BEV

""But it's more expensive""

Yes. I know that, but long term it's cheaper. The fuel savings alone for my wife driving 800km a week will be good enough over the life of the car. She drives 200km a day, 4 days a week.

""You know it's real world range is only around 300km each charge right?""

Yes, but she doesn't drive over 300km in a hit normally, it's her commute, 90km one way, 90km return, might do some shopping on the way home.

""Where do you plan to charge it?""

At home

""Do you have the capacity to do that?""

My house has electricity. So yes. (Personally I'm thinking who doesn't have electricity at their house these days)

""Yes, but do you have the capacity to charge at home?""

Mate, I've got single and 3 phase, and solar, yes, I can charge.

""But you know the Electric is $10,000 more expensive than the Hybrid right?""

Yeah you said that, but I'm saving on the servicing.

""But the electrics still need servicing""

Yeah on that, what are you servicing there? Because other EV manufacturers don't do 15,000km services, and when I contacted the other dealer in Brisbane that I attempted to go to in February on both the Kona and Ioniq, they sent me the standardised Hyundai combustion motor service schedule. First on the lost was ""Change engine oil"" which clearly they are not doing as an electric doesn't have an engine.

(At this point he seemed to get a bit flustered)

""Yeah well they check your brake pads, bushes, brake fluid, umm, do software updates, top up your coolant, you know, normal service stuff""

(Really? Normal service stuff. I'll be honest, I have never once needed to service my brake fluid, pads, busted or coolant every 15,000kms. Brake fluid every 5 years generally to avoid it becoming waterlogged, about the same on brake pads, and if you are topping up Coolant every 15,000kms, it's going somewhere. That's an issue if it's part of the service schedule to top up the coolant. Bushes? They should be lasting 75-100,000kms. Easy. Especially on a highway car. Not 15,000kms. As for software updates, there is zero need to go to a dealer and pay for them, even LDV does them for free)

Oh yeah, ""normal"" service stuff for an EV would be nothing until something is needed right? That's how others like Tesla play it.

""Yeah but you wouldn't buy a Tesla would you""

I'm considering it in comparison.

""Yeah but you know, the Americans make bad cars, and honestly, Tesla is the worst of the bunch""

Oh yeah, do tell. What makes them so bad.

[Cue about a 5 minute tirade on trim falling off, seats not locking in place, paint issues, panel gaps, froots flying open on the highway, etc. He got passionate, he clearly detests Tesla]

Yeah fair enough, Tesla sound pretty shit then. So when might you have an Electric in for us to have a look at?

""Don't know, we don't really sell many of them, they're just too expensive""

Really? Despite the savings?

""Yeah well you aren't really saving much when you think about it""

No worries, well thanks for your time.

[At this point we left]

So 800km × 42 weeks my wife works per year = 33,600km

At 7l/100km that's 2,352l of fuel, at $1.21/l that's $2,845.92

So if the Ioniq has a 38.3kWh battery and a real world range of 300km, that's 127.6Wh/km

So per year that's 4,289,600.01Wh or 4,289.60001kWh

Now with the solar feed in and nightly but back, it evens out around $0.05/kWh so that's $214.480001 per year to run that car.

That's a saving of $2,631.44 per year just on fuel.

So at $10,000 more (in reality the top Ioniq is $58,123 and the top of line Hybrid is $44,917 which is actually $13,209 which is what I'll use)

$13,209 ÷ $2,631.44 = 5.01976134 years

So after 5 years, I'm saving money easily. That's not counting the insurance savings, the rego savings, if I save around $300 a year on rego that brings me to $2,931.44 and brings it to:

$13,209 ÷ $2,931.44 = 4.50597658 years, saving 6 months off the cost difference.

Insurance is a different kettle, I know it'll be less, not sure how much exactly, but less. A Tesla Model 3 was less than what I currently pay on the wife's car.

Honestly, I sent this to Hyundai yesterday afternoon before deciding to post this review, but hell, they had the heads up both by me sending it via email to the customer care team and their social media team.

Like, it's pretty clear to me that the electric car is far cheaper to run, far cheaper than he was even implying that it would be. He was even suggesting as if we could not charge it at home, as if there's some type of magical way to charge it.

On that note:

127.6Wh/km × 200km a day = 24,920Wh or 24.92kWh, according to Wikipedia the home charger provided from 2020 is 7.2kW

So 24.92kWh ÷ 7.2kW = 3.46111111 hours.

We sleep more than that every night, more than viable to charge at home.

Like... I'm only seeing the benefits here, but it seems the salesman was hell bent on NOT selling me an electric, at best, a HEV model, not even the PHEV version.

Honestly, I remember the days you walked in and said ""I want that one and I want it in blue, and I want it by next Tuesday"" and the salespeople would launch over desks to try and upsell you some floor mats and get it to you by Monday.

But after 6 months, COVID, uncertainty, etc we decided that yes, it was still a thing that we wanted an EV, and that yes, the Ioniq was still at the top of the wife's list. So we go back in, but not to the deer that clearly didn't want our business, but to a rural dealer we thought would want the business, and hey, #supportrural and stuff.

What we came out if it was as if we were stupid for wanting an electric car, I was stupid for questioning the service schedule, that an EV is unsuitable for a 200km/day commute and that Tesla builds cars that are super bad.

I have to say, this is also the exact opposite impression I get from the marketing from Hyundai. So one hand I believe is not talking to the other, or Hyundai is paying lip service to the EV community.

Honestly, what happened to car dealers who would just take your money and off you go? I'd have preferred that, just sell it to me, I want it in blue, ta, thanks.

Plus it's a more expensive car, isn't it in the car world where you work on Commission as a % of the value of the car like 10% commission or something? So by talking people out of the EV you're talking cash out of your pocket aren't you?

I dunno, I'll just say that 2 dealers in and around Brisbane have now soured the idea of owning a Hyundai for me and my wife. We probably will go the M3 for her, with all its panel gaps and shitty paint and stuff.

Why?

Cos they are excited to sell you a car, they want to sell you a car, they want to show you the car, they want to answer questions about the car, they want you to have that car parked in your driveway.

As for me, I'll keep going on my little EV conversion project, it's fun, it's exciting, and I'm thoroughly enjoying myself on it.

Hopefully soon the Diesel will exist only to tow the camper and spend half its life or more on the battery tender.

Edit: For those that say ""*It's just one bad dealer*"" maybe so, but I had that experience when I bought a Foton ute a couple of years back as a Business car. Local dealer never had one for a test drive, never wanted to discuss one, wasn't getting one in. So I drove 300km to a dealer that had one, test drove it, and bought it.

Then the problems started, the rear main seal started leaking, dropped it off, 8 days later they finally got around to fixing it.

2 weeks later the rear main started leaking again and the transmission wouldn't shift, this time it spent 28 days in the workshop.

A month later it went back with a leak, spent 30 days in the workshop getting a full bottom end rebuild.

5 days after picking it up from that, the transmission shifter was inoperative. That was another 7 days.

6 weeks after that the transmission failed again at selecting gears, that time it was in there for 11 days getting that fixed.

It was very very clear that they never wanted to sell me the car in the first place, and when it needed repairs under warranty, they had zero desire to fix it under warranty as a dealer.

Hence why I am dubious to buy a car that a dealer doesn't want to sell, as my experience has been that yes, I can go out of my way to get it, but if I ever have an issue, I'm stuffed with no support.

#TLDR: Dealer is Arsehole and doesn't want to sell car."

Owning an electric car but no garage: Is it feasible?
For the last two decades, I have gotten along nicely without owning my own car. Lately, though, I have been confronted with a situation where I might possibly need to have one after all for commuting. Of course, I would really prefer to have an electric one if I have to have one.

There's one problem with that, though:  
I don't own or rent a house, I just rent an apartment (like a lot of people living in cities the world over...), and I don't have my own garage or even parking spot. Like a lot of people, I could just park my car on the side of the road or on public parking lots, but charging would be a problem. There are a small number of public charging stations in my city, but they're all too far to walk to and from every day. Obviously, I'm not going to buy a house just so I can charge an electric car.

Does anyone here have practical experience with owning and operating an electric car in an urban setting *without* having their own garage? Particularly in Germany? Has anyone made this work for themselves and could share their experiences? Does anyone have any experience with asking a local city council to set up more charging stations in certain parts of the city?

It seems to me that would be a quite relevant topic for a lot of people. The way I see it, at the moment, electric cars only really make sense for rich people or people living in rural areas…"

EV car purchase planning help needed.
I plan on buying a Tesla Model 3 sometime between now and 3 years down the road. I am the sole income in my house with a wife and two small kids. I just landed a new job and my wife is about to re-enter the workforce. My house is a bit older and has a 150 Amp electric panel with outdated switches that are a fire risk. (last summer the A/C kept popping the switch due to the panel heating up)

Also, my new commute will be 31 miles one way for a round trip of 62 miles. There are charging stations 2 miles from my job. (morning exercise?) Right now I have a Jeep but my wife is going to need it at least 3 days a week and working from home 3 days a week will not be an option at the new job.

Right now I am considering the following 4 factors:
1) Upgrade my electric panel and get a charging station installed for a grand total of $4,500 ($3500 to upgrade to a 200 amp panel, $500 to install a charging station, $500 for the charging station)
2) Buy a used Leaf for $8-$10k.
3) Buy a used Prius for $10k.
4) Go extreme and buy a really used Prius for $3-5k or less.
5) Wait out the Model 3 and Lyft both ways for $80/day

If I go with item #2 I have to do item #1 right away. If I go for anything else I can wait on #1 until both me and my wife are working. If I go for #2 I can add the cost #1 to the bank loan and I fix a fire hazard and get a car now.

My fear with the Leaf is that it won't survive the 62 mile daily commute on a used battery. That's also my worry with a $5k Prius with 175k miles on it. However I would expect to only keep the car until I can get the Tesla. Worst case that should be 3 years.

My goal is be in a Model 3 in three years or so and spend as little on transportation until I get to that point. I am not a mechanic, so working on a car is not going to save me money.

Regardless, does any of this make sense? Is there another way I should consider approaching this problem?"

Besides Tesla or the Chevy Bolt, is there an EV that will work for me?
I have a budget of about $15,000 before my trade in. My daily commute is a minimum of 70 highway miles round trip and there's no EV parking near my office that I am aware of. I can charge at home without a problem.

I know that there are a handful of 2017/18 cars that will have the range that I need, but, those are out of my budget. Are there any  pure EV's that might work for me? I'm guessing not, but, I figure it cannot hurt to double check."

Residential charging
I don't think the issue of residential charging gets enough attention? I don't know what car I will end up owning next year but I am sure that by 2020 I will drive an electric car. My problems of range requirements (I need 160 miles under any condition... without paying an astronomical price for it) will be gone by then and after, I will be left with the pesky issue of recharging my car in the laziest and neatest possible way.

To solve this issue, it would just require all car companies to agree on a standard of wireless charging. So that if I decide to go for an electric car, I can invest into a wireless charging station without the worry of it becoming redundant by the time I change the car again for a space ship .. okay just kidding.

Is there progress in this area?"

Private Use of Public Charging Stations Could Spoil the Electric Vehicle Market
Car manufacturers sold almost twice as many electric vehicles in 2014 as they did between 2010 and 2013. We went from 320,000 electric cars on the roads in 2013 to more than 740,000 at the end of 2014. The EV market is currently exploding, and with it the need for electric charging stations.

Public charging stations are popping up everywhere, from Australia to New Jersey. But what about private stations? Most early adopters of electric vehicles were home owners. They had the resources and ability to install private chargers in their garage. Now that the market extends to a larger public, we see more and more EV owners who live in condos or apartment complexes. How can they set up their own charging station?

Providers such as ChargePoint recommend Property Managers to install public chargers in private parking. While this solution can be quick and easy, it is in the long run an expensive and inefficient one. Here’s why.

Public charging stations are not reliable: Let’s take the example of a building with 50 apartments and the same number of parking spaces. The solution offered by public charging providers is to block a few parking spots to install stations on. Property managers then turn these spots into “community parking for electric vehicles”. 

This setup will work well when only a few residents own electric cars. They can share the stations without conflict. But what happens when 10, 20, 30 residents own an electric vehicle? They will have to compete to get a spot, making it stressful and inefficient for everyone. 

You may think that the answer to this problem is to add “community chargers”. But when adding chargers, property managers will face a second, more important problem:

Public charging stations don’t scale: While Level 1 charging stations are enough for hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles usually need Level 2 charging stations. Level 2 chargers use 240 volts and cut the charging time by about one-half compared with 120 volt charging. Level 2 EV chargers require 30-40 amps to operate. 

Buildings have a finite amount of power when constructed. Since they weren’t built with EV charging in mind its common for a property to only have 100-150 amps of power available for EV charging. 

That’s easy math: A building with 100 amps available will not be able to power more than 3 public chargers. Once available power is used to facilitate more chargers ,the building may have to invest in transformers or bringing in new service to the building Adding new service is prohibitively expensive and requires major building work.

The Solution: Intelligent Charging Stations

EV owners don’t need to charge their car all the time. Some may need to charge it at night, while others only need to charge on the weekends. Yet a traditional charger will block the power it needs to be operational at all times. Whether a car is being charged or not.

The solution is to make charging stations more “intelligent”. A smart EV charger network can distribute the power between several chargers and manage supply based on usage. Each resident can have their own dedicated charger and receive power when they need it. Property managers can install more chargers without having to upgrade their electric infrastructure immediately.

Where to find Smart EV Charging Stations?

EverCharge is the first provider of smart EV chargers. Our network of charging stations learns from residents’ usage to intelligently distribute power. Using EverCharge, property managers can install up to 12 chargers on just 100 amps. That’s 9 more than what could be done using public chargers. We limit costs while keeping all residents happy.

We now live in a world where sustainable development has become a necessity to slow down climate change. Switching from motor to electric vehicles is one of the most important steps towards this goal. Yet the results of this major change will be tarnished if we are not able to distribute power more efficiently. EverCharge can help make a difference at our humble scale, and we hope you’ll join us."

Best option for a first EV?
Hi, all! I am in the market for a used EV, my first ever. My first (and only other) car was a very problematic & unreliable 2003 Nissan Xterra that I only had for about two months before it became unusable for my purposes. It sold for cheap a few weeks ago, and now I need a new vehicle. I have always wanted an EV, so I’ve been researching but need some help narrowing down. I plan to use gov-auctions.org to snag the best deal I can (hopefully under $10k USD, but a tad over that is doable).

There are some major considerations that would affect which vehicle I should get:

- I live in an urban area with HOT summers (90s-100s F°) but mild winters (no snow, usually at least 40 F° even at night)

- I cannot charge at home. My living situation requires street parking, but I have several charging stations (DCFC and Level 2) available a few blocks away.

- My daily commutes are ~30 miles round-trip, and often shorter. But because of the no at-home charging, a longer range would be ideal so that I can charge less frequently (but please correct me if a shorter range would be okay for my needs! I am obviously very new to EVs).

- I am a college student who can charge on campus while I am in class, but there are limited chargers there.

- NHTSA 5-star safety rating is important to me. So is reliability.

- I do not want a Tesla.


Less important considerations include:

- I don’t want an SUV if I can help it. I’d love a more compact, nimble car—especially when it comes to width. My streets are narrow and I’d like a car that is easy to maneuver within them.

- I take some longer trips for fun (~70-100 miles), but very infrequently.

- I’d prefer a car with a physical lever/knob for the gear selector (even something quirky like the one in the LEAF) over the newer dials and buttons that are becoming more common. I just like the tactile element of a more traditional knob.

- Similar to the above, I just tend to prefer cars with more physical buttons rather than touch screens. An assistive screen is great, but not when it controls everything in the car.


The main models I have considered so far:

Chevrolet Bolt EV
- Meets my requirements, but has been discontinued. I worry that parts and maintenance services will become scarce with time.

Nissan LEAF
- Most affordable option, and I’d favor the second generation. But the battery air-cooling seems risky considering the hot summers. Plus, the range isn’t as high as other similar EVs, even in the Plus trims.

Hyundai Kona EV
- I’ve been told it’s a better-quality car than the above two, but I haven’t gotten a clear explanation as to why. Slightly bigger car than I’d like, and pricier, too.


Any advice, corrections, guidance, and other vehicle ideas would be greatly appreciated!


TL;DR: Looking for my first EV, mostly for daily commutes under 30 miles, on a budget. Can’t charge at home or park in a garage. Live in a city with very hot summers."

XC40 vs EQB vs Ariya
Looking for some advice. Trying to decide between (i) 2022 XC40 Recharge (ii) 2022 EQB 250 or 300 (iii) 2023 or 2024 Ariya.

My priorities are #1 reliability #2 price #3 safety and insurance cost #4 size.

Range doesn't matter for me as all of these get over 200 per charge. I value reliability and want the one that works the most flawlessly the most often. I've read about many software gremlins for these and would like to minimize that headache. I also want a car with reliable battery...probably a history of decent EV's from the brand.



Charging speed doesn't matter to me. The car will be L2 charged 99% of the time overnight. 



One nagging thing I'd want is a car with enough sidewall to minimize curb rash. The people in my family driving the car are just prone to it. Funny enough, all else being equal, sidewall might be the deciding factor.

I already know the lowest price is the Ariya followed by the EQB then the XC40 is the most.

Appreciate advice. Thanks."

Hydrogen and alternative fuels are just a delay tactic by the oil industry and legacy car makers, right?
Recently I had an interesting discussion with two older gentleman. One of them said he ""doesn't believe in electric cars"" (like it's some sort of religion), and the other one was quick to point out that hydrogen powered cars are just around the corner and we should all hold off on buying EVs because hydrogen cars will wipe the floor with them. Exactly how they would accomplish this he didn't specify and I didn't ask. 
Oh, and this ""recent"" discussion took place several years ago.

And sure enough, on the surface hydrogen powered cars look like a ""drop in replacement"" for ICE cars. Car has tank, you fill it up when empty, job done. Same principal, same behavior and time scales.

However, when you take a closer look, the viability of hydrogen relies on access to cheap electricity to produce said hydrogen. And even then it would be much more efficient to charge a battery instead of going through all the lossy steps associated with the production, transportation, storage and conversion of hydrogen back into electricity.

Hydrogen powered cars (and possibly buses, trucks, trains, ferries and so on) seem to be a dead horse that is being beaten vigorously by people that have a monetary (or ideological) interest in delaying the adoption of EVs by offering a ""better"" (objectively worse, but more ICE like) solution in the form of hydrogen fuel cell cars which are juuuust around the corner at all times.

Any government that is still subsidizing hydrogen powered road vehicles and related research is in my mind stalling real progress by wasting public money on a technology that is unsuitable for most transportation applications. And I hope I don't come across as ideologically motivated by saying this. I'm just shocked that we're still dumping huge amounts of money into the hydrogen pit while simultaneously using it as an excuse to not buy EVs.

And to be fair, when I heard of the Toyota Mirai on Top Gear probably twenty years ago (when there was only one Top Gear) for the first time, and James May was driving it around California, the idea of a hydrogen powered car did sound good! But then nothing came of it. Even with massive government support, no reliable hydrogen refuelling network could be built up in CA, prices for H2 remained high, technical (and physical) challenges related to the production and storage of hydrogen remain largely unsolved, Mirai sales figures stalled, and one would think with the advent of mass market EVs with long range and fast recharging the hydrogen dream would die in a dignified way, but somehow no.

What are your thoughts on the topic and what do you do when someone ""is just waiting for a few more years for hydrogen cars to appear""?

EV charging solution - What do you think?
Hey everyone,  
I'm thinking about a EV Charging business-model and wanted to get your input!

A lot of EV owners in big cities (especially those living in apartments or condos) don’t have access to a charger at home. The idea is to offer a **valet-style EV charging service**. You’d schedule a pickup through an app—we come to your work or home, take your car to a nearby fast charger or regular free/ cheap charging station, charge it, and return it fully charged (safely and reliably).

As an example you could put a time you want the car picked up and delivered, it can be overnight or while your at work. fast or regular charging. price will differ from time you wish the car picked up and delivered depending on volume. 

The service could be:

* **On-demand**: $30–$50 per charge
* **Monthly subscription**: $149 for 8 charges, $249 for 12, or $399 for daily weekday service
* Could also include light vacuuming, tire pressure check, etc.

this is the price just for the service and not the actually electricity/charging price.

We’d only operate in high-density EV areas to keep things efficient.

I'm curious:

* Would you use a service like this?
* What would you consider a fair price?
* What additional features or services would make this worth it?

Appreciate any feedback—trying to see if this is something worth piloting.

Thanks!"

Ioniq Electric Ultimate 2020 or Chevrolet Bolt Premier 2018
I am looking to buy an electric car as an Uber Eats delivery driver who drives around 15 to 20,000 miles a year. I want a car that is not too expensive, has good features and technology and is reliable. So far two cars stand out to me :

2018 Chevrolet bolt premier with 110,000 km (± 70 000 miles) for 16 000$ CAD (11 500 USD)

It had the battery replaced under the recall in 2022 and the battery is still under warranty for 65 000 miles or 5 years.

It comes with nothing (not even summer tires, I'd have to get some right now) and the dealer won't budge on the price, or won't even give me tires with it, but it's still a pretty good deal here (Quebec).

I had an inspected and there's around $1,000 of maintenance to be done on the car but everything else looks good.

The other one is a 2020 ioniq electric ultimate with 115 000 km (pretty much the same as the Bolt) for 16 750$ CAD (12 000 USD)

I'm waiting on an inspection but it looks really well maintained and it's newer so I think the inspection will turn out pretty good. It has a 30,000 miles bumper to bumper warranty and the battery also has 30 000 miles left on its warranty.

It comes with summer and winter tires both on rims and in very good condition. The price is slightly negotiable and I have less taxes to pay on this one because it's sold by an individual and not a dealer.

I know the Bolt has a better range than the Ioniq but I could live with it and I think the ionic is more comfortable, better looking and 2 years newer, but the Bolt is faster and can do around 60 more miles per charge.

Which one would you go for and why? Thank you! "

First EV
I will be getting my first EV next week, and I am undecided on which one I should go with. I travel up to 400 miles a day for work, but can charge at home over night each day. I know I am leaning towards something with a long range. 

So far I have :

2024 Hyundai Ioniq6
2025 Chevy Equinox

I would love your opinion on these if you’ve driven any of them! 

I really like the Equinox being so budget friendly with a long range, but is it worth the slow charging?

I know out of these the Hyundai Ioniq6 charges the fastest and has the longest range, but it’s also the highest priced, so if you know any other good options to look into, let me know! 

EDIT: most days my miles are kept between 200-300 miles, but once or twice a month I will travel up to the 400 miles. I know a hybrid would be better for the long trip days, but I wouldn’t mind charging on the trips a couple days a month as long as the car will not need charging for the majority of my days. 

EDIT 2: I route planned my trips for work the rest of the week and the longest day I have is 275 miles. I took the trips and plugged into ABRP using a Chevy Equinox which has the slowest charging speeds out of the cars I’ve looked at and the app said it would only add about 40 minutes for my entire day to plan a trip to stay charged and hit my stops. Is A Better Route Planner reliable on trip and charging time for specific vehicles? These trips are all very doable, but not if the app doesn’t calculate charge speeds very accurately. Also, does the app account for temperature adjustments in the winter if I used the app to plan long trips when it’s cold out?

Edit 3: After doing a trip today, which ended up being 308 miles, my ABRP said that I would have completed the same trip, just in different ways, with only a 25 minute difference because of the charging and extra miles. And that was set on the app using an Equinox EV, and going from a 90-10 charge for the day. 
Also, I realized today that I stop regularly to follow up on calls, emails, and messages, and charging would not be hard if I planned to do my follow-ups for work during charging times instead of just pulling over in a parking lot to answer the messages. I think this would make it even more possible to use an EV despite the long drives for my work. "

Zeekr 001 (Premium AWD - EU Version) Owners/Drivers – Cruise Control Glitchy? Software Feedback?
Hey everyone,

I recently test drove the Zeekr 001 Premium AWD (European version) and while I was very impressed with the performance, comfort, and design, I noticed something odd with the cruise control / adaptive cruise system.

It felt a bit glitchy or inconsistent, especially in slow traffic. The braking and acceleration didn't feel as smooth or confident as I expected. For comparison, I also drove the Hyundai Ioniq 5 AWD, and its cruise control system felt noticeably more refined and smoother.

So I wanted to ask:

Is this glitchiness in cruise control normal for the Zeekr 001?

How is the software experience overall? Any lags, bugs, or annoyances?

Does it improve with updates?

How does it compare to other EVs you’ve owned or tested (e.g. Ioniq 5, Model Y, BMW i4)?

If you own one: are you happy with the car after a few months?


Also — if anyone has other suggestions for EVs in the same price range (~220k QAR or ~55k EUR), that have great tech, smooth driving assist, and long-term reliability, I’d love to hear them.

Thanks in advance for any insight!

They seem to reach 300,400, even 500k miles with barely any issues whatsoever.Break replacements every 250k miles. carcarenut has a video of a prime with 360k miles and he says its flawless and looks like a car with 20-30k miles. that same person now has around 500k miles and just now needed to do a 1k repair ,first one. 

Buut the prime is just too small for camping with the battery taking up most of the boot. For the same money the Id4 is so much more spacious and nicer.

People mention evs save money on maintenance but that only seems to be true if you compare them to American and European cars which are mostly junk,not when compared to Toyota or Honda.

Its just so frustrating because I've done weeks of research ,spend dozens of hours reading,and for every Ev i read Theres some sort of teething issues. Tesla heat pumps keep failing every winter over and over, $4k repair each time . Also Tesla AC's keep failing which I've never heard of happening in a Toyota and the cost can also be 4,5k just for the AC. 2021 Tesla batteries fail. VW id4 software,battery modules and front drive motors fail. Also water pumps. Which sucks because I really like the id4. Mach e hvbjc fails, sometimes even after replacement. ioniq 5 and ev6 iccu keep failing,bricking the car and causing a $10k repair out of warranty. also even when replaced under recall work, the replacements still fail and the recall only covers the first replacement .

The problem is out of warranty these repairs are massively costly ,like 5k plus up to 20k. no third party shop options.  People say oh don't worry it's all covered by warranty,which is simply not acceptable. especially when I'm looking at used cars that are already almost out of warranty and I plan to put massive miles on. Your average Toyota is extremely unlikely to ever need massive repairs like this. I'm not even mentioning the smaller issues and repairs like door handles or air suspension in used model s's(5k cost) because air suspension is unreliable in any car except Lexus.

Is there any Ev out there that can compete with a Toyota? I'm only looking at Evs due to their camping ability. no home charging so sadly I'd have to pay the equivalent of 25mpg in my state for charging due to cheap gas. But I could try to use free public chargers at night when camping.

I really do want an EV despite trashing them. I think their the future and their very smooth and ideal for camping. But I also really want something I don't have to worry about.

I think deep down I have anxiety and a hard time trusting any car not made by the Japanese. They seem like the only people in the world who know how to properly build a car. I wish so badly that Toyota had competitive EVs. thought id also kill for a Chinese Ev, they seem amazing. BYD might be the new Toyota if their cars hold up."

Real 2025 Tesla Battery Data: 70% Capacity Predicted Even After 740,000 km!
I analyzed battery health data from 10 Tesla owners on Reddit using Tesla’s new April 2025 diagnostic tool. On average, batteries degrade 4.03% per 100,000 km, suggesting they could retain 70% capacity after ~740,000 km!

This chart is based on a linear regression model with statistical bootstrapping to improve reliability. While I know battery degradation isn’t truly linear — it’s typically faster in the first few years (<100,000 km) — this model helps capture the long-term stabilized trend.

Most samples are US NMC batteries. I’m keen to see how LFPs perform!

Slate EV
(I'm not educated on EV's, so pardon me if I use improper vocabulary)
This thing has been popping up everywhere for me, on YouTube, Instagram, and simple discussion among peers. Is it really worth the hype? 

So far I've heard it has: 
Rear drive (Dual motor is a future plan)
150 mile range 
Cost under $20,000 (possibly?)
Standard Tesla charging capabilities 
And insane customization 

It screams DIY and I'm not sure if that's incredibly reliable. This summer I'm getting a 1961 Chevy C-10 from a friend to work on, and as of now I'm planning on keeping it after it's all worked out, but if this new Slate truck takes off is it bad that I'm considering selling the Chevy so I can buy it?
My whole family has Tesla's, so it would fit right into our ecosystem, but I want to know what y'all think."

best ev cars under 50
i have had a hybrid toyota rav4 ever since i started driving. i got in an extremely bad car crash this week which ended up totaling the car, so now, me and my dad are on the hunt for an ev. my dad paid for most of my car payments and things like that (which i am extremely grateful for) so it is his call on what type of car it is, i already knew he would say it has to be electric (my mom and dad both have an ev) 

i do not know that much about cars and what will be reliable and the best choice for me. all i know is that it needs to be an ev, 30k-45k, and not a tesla!!

Home charger recommendation
I have owned a model S for 7.5 years.   I have never had an actual charger for it…just had a 50amp service plug (like for a clothes dryer) installed in my garage and it has seemed to work fine.   I don’t really know if that has hurt anything.   I have experienced some battery degradation but not sure how much of that is basically normal.  

I am getting a second electric vehicle so will need to get another plug installed but wonder if I should go ahead and install an actual charger.   New (for me) is a used Mercedes EQS if that makes any difference to the discussion.  

Any thoughts on reliable and cost efficient chargers?

Thanks for the input.  "

Kia Niro vs Chevy Bolt
Most importantly: I live in a climate that gets hot and cold weather! Pretty extreme on both ends, can be 20 degrees Fahrenheit in winter and 115 in summer. Niro has a ""cold weather package"" that is supposed to better insulate the battery, is this worth it?

My budget is less than $20k after tax credit. Important that it's a good value and reliable. Must have range about 150, I don't plan to use it for road trips but I live somewhat rurally and easily drive 75-100 miles for errands. I can charge overnight at my house and don't plan to use chargers while out n about. 

Kia Niro and Bolt seem like good options. Prefer 4 doors so no Mini. Once in a while I also see a Kona in my price range. Any years to avoid? Any advice between these vehicles? TIA!"

How much does EV durability/reliability vary?
My wife and I are thinking about getting an EV. She comes from a family that likes to get Subarus/Toyotas/Hondas, on the thinking that these makers are a lot more reliable. The cars last longer and don't need as much maintenance. Her instinct is to also get an EV by one of these makers. But I wonder if that's necessary, given that EVs generally require little maintenance and there are cheaper options from other brands like Kia, Nissan, etc. Are some EV makers more reliable than others?"

Should I consider a used EV?
I know this has been done to death, but I'll ask again anyway.

I'm open to the idea of buying an EV, but I'm still on the fence, and not sure if it would be practical in my situation. I've been car shopping for much of this year, with a plan of buying next spring, and have more or less settled on a Mazda CX-30 (yes, an ICE). I love everything about this car, except it's poor fuel economy. SUV ride height while still being a small car (I'm tall), AWD, a ton of creature comforts, and reliability. Initially, I was going to just live with it. It's very similar to my current car in the MPG department, so my fueling bill essentially wouldn't change.

But... let's just say ""recent events"" and the potential impact those ""recent events"" could have on the US car market have me considering purchasing something sooner, like this month (Dec. 2024) or early January '25. Still, the CX-30 was my top contender. But I started wondering what those ""recent events"" would also do to gas prices, especially since I would be driving a car that only gets about 22 MPG in the city with a smaller gas tank than a Corolla.

So I'm revisiting the idea of an EV instead. My budget is $25k, so right at the price limit for the federal EV tax credit (and I'd like to get in on that before it's gone too). This opens me up to Chevy Bolts, Tesla Model 3's (though I'm not a huge fan), some VW ID.4's...

But here's the thing (and why an EV probably won't work for me) - I am unable to install a 240v home charger. I would be stuck living off a 120v travel charger or public charging (of which there isn't a lot in my area). I live in Kansas, where it gets both ridiculously hot and ridiculously cold, which could affect range.

My daily work commute is only about 20 miles round trip (no charging at work), but I have family out of town and need to travel occasionally, 200-300 miles round trip with very little charging opportunity along the way, though I could charge at my destination if I bring a travel charger.

Most EV's in my price range offer around 250 miles off a full charge in perfect conditions. Obviously, with my travel needs and the fact that I'd be stuck almost exclusively slow charging, this would introduce a little bit of range anxiety.

Is an EV right for me? If so, what are some models I should consider? Or should I consider a hybrid, PHEV, or more efficient ICE instead?"

Good affordable choices for 2025?
Any recommendations for affordable EV's? 

- this will be my first car, but my gf has an ICE so range is less of a concern for me
- located in socal
- my daily commute is 5 miles 
- work offers charging 
- budget around $27000, would prefer lower but am flexible

I looked at
- Nissan ioniq 5/6 (used) to get this within budget
- Nissan leaf (new or used) , concerned about its discontinuation. I heard discontinued vehicles are harder to repair? 
- Chevy bolt (new) , looking to get tax credit. Also worriee about its discontinuation 
- Chevy equinox?? 

I'm pretty new to cars, but here are my thoughts so far:
- I like the look of the ioniqs but how does the reliability and affordability compare to the other picks?
- the Chevy bolt seems to be the best budget pick but I've been warned against American cars and discontinued cars. Any thoughts on this?"

Range: 150+ miles per full charge
Good reliability
Fast charge if possible
4 doors if possible
Around 10 grand average cost for used car- less would be great

I know it’s a tall order but if even a couple of these wish list items are met that would be great

Looking for resources/information about purchasing first EV and feeling a bit overwhelmed.
Hi all, thank you in advance for any tips, resources, info shared. I decided my next car I would purchase would be an EV after driving my old 2002 Honda for years. I thought I had more time to research and make more informed decisions but my transmission is going out and I'll need to replace much sooner than intended. 

With this said, I'm feeling a bit overwhelmed on making the switch to EV sooner than intended. 

My two biggest questions are: 

I would like to buy used. What years are best to buy from? I would like something reliable and affordable. 

I won't be able to install any charging station at home and will likely not be able to charge from there at all. I live in a mid size city in the midwest, so there is charging stations throughout the city. I've seen a lot of people recommend the Bolt. How long will it take to charge this with a Level 2 charger? Does anyone use a portable charger for at home charging? Are these effective? 

  
Any information, tips, resources are appreciated. Just suddenly feeling overwhelmed with the switch but strongly believe it is the best option right now. TIA!"

Most reliable EV for $20k?
I keep hearing how EVs are going down in price and there's the $4k or so tax credit. 
I'm looking for a commuter, about 25 miles half of which is highway. There'll only be 1 person inside the car most of the time, so rear seats aren't a priority. A hatch style trunk would be nice for shopping runs but not necessary. 

Now for reliability, I'd like it to be as repairable as possible as I'll be doing all the maintenance myself. Companies like tesla have a reputation for locking down their stuff and being unfriendly to right to repair, would like to avoid that."

Hello from Indonesia 
This is a Wuling Cloud Ev and it’s only available in  Indonesia market. This is my 2nd week of owning it and would like to share my experience.

Range of the car was advised at 460km ( sorry guys, this is Asia, we go by KM not miles)

Fast charging stations are not as reliable as in the USA they only have a few station around the country with GP/T port
Which is for the China make car market 
Tesla and most cars are using CCS2 ports 

They also claim charging takes 20%-100% at 30mins. But actual it take about 1h 15mins
It’s due to how much voltage is coming out from the plug itself

2021 Renault Zoe ZE50 vs 2021 Nissan Leaf?
I am planning to buy a secondhand EV for my commute, which twice to three times per week, 1 to 1.5 hours in each direction (around 100km total per day). It is around 30km on country roads followed by 20km traffic on a capital city ring road 

I will be charging from a public charging station (€0.47 per kWh) once to twice per week, with a nightly granny cable top-up, until I get a charging point installed.

My criteria are:
* Small size - I will be travelling alone in traffic, want to be able to park easily
* Comfortable and quiet cabin - I will be in the car 2-3 hours per day on commuting days, so want to be comfortable
* Range over 250km - to allow for two days commuting back to back 
* Reliability - don’t want to have big repair bills 
* Support for a wide variety of chargers, and public fast charging - If I’m using public chargers I l’d like it to be for a few hours max, not overnight
* Isofix points, four doors - Sometimes will need to bring my toddler with me
* No battery lease - Dont want the hassle and monthly cost

Things I’m not so concerned about:
* Luggage space - I will only have a backpack on the commute. We have a larger petrol car for big trip
* Rear seat legroom - Won’t be carrying adults in the back
* Range over 350km - not a big concern, nice to have. Not sure it’s worth carrying the extra battery weight for my use case

In my price brackets I am looking at 2021 Renault Zoe ZE50, and 2021 Nissan Leaf, both less than 90k km (Zoe’s have lower mileage in this price bracket). The Zoe’s in this range have a 50kWh battery, the Leaf has 40kWh (I assume it is also heavier so range should be more reduced).
 
This generation of Zoe should have support for all chargers, and no battery lease.
The Leaf looks more comfortable inside.

I’m leaning towards a Zoe, but wondering if anyone is going to tell me to 100% buy the Leaf despite the smaller battery."

Need Advice: Peugeot 308 SW Electric vs Volvo EX30
Hi everyone,

I’m in a bit of a dilemma and could really use some advice. My company is offering me a choice between two electric cars for my new company vehicle: the Peugeot 308 SW Electric and the Volvo EX30. I don’t have much experience with either, and since it’s a company car, I need to make the right choice.

Here’s what I’m considering:

1. **Peugeot 308 SW Electric**:
   * **Pros**: Looks great, spacious (especially for a wagon), and seems to have a decent range. I’ve heard it’s practical for daily use and trips.
   * **Cons**: I’m not sure about Peugeot’s track record with EVs. How reliable is it, especially for longer drives?
2. **Volvo EX30**:
   * **Pros**: Volvo’s known for safety, and I’m drawn to the premium feel and tech. It’s also a bit more compact, which might be nice for city driving.
   * **Cons**: It’s smaller, so I’m wondering if it’s too tight for longer trips or if it’ll have enough range for what I need.

Since it’s a company car, my main concerns are reliability, comfort, and practicality for both daily commuting and occasional longer trips. I’d love to hear from anyone who’s driven or owns one of these models. Which would you choose and why?

Thanks a ton for your help!"

SUV (likely used) for ~35k
I’m getting ready to dive into the world of EVs for the first time and wanted to get some ideas on what people would buy in my price range.

I’m looking for an EV SUV, which will be our family’s sole car (my 15 mile commute, errands, occasional vacation). Reliability is probably my most important factor (I care less about performance, amenities, etc). We would set up a charging station at our home.

Budget is around $35k (maybe could stretch to 38). I don’t want a Tesla, but am open to most other makes. I’m mostly looked at used models from 2021-23 or so, but am open to other ideas.

And last question - a used Ioniq 5 was my front runner, but I’m a bit concerned about the ICCU recall when buying a used model (in my price range, it looks like I’d be looking at a 2021 or 2022, which might be caught by the recall). Am I right to be concerned about this?

Best electric SUV 2024. Range, interior design and efficiency
Hi ElectricCars!

I'm looking for advice. So far, my electric SUV research has taken up a lot of time, and the more time passes, the more questions I have.   
  
Let's start with a few exclusions:  
- after test-driving most, I am not a huge fan of Kia and Hyunday's EVs. They are OK cars, but they lack that premium feel, and I am looking for   
a) something a bit bigger that can fit a family of 4 with two dogs  
b) high-grade interior finish   
c) driving dynamics that are precise and exciting

My best list so far: 

**Genesis GV70**: I love the design, and it's 3.7-second 0- 60 time. However, I am worried about the range. Do you have any experience with this?  
**Audi SQ6 e-Tron**: it's a great car, but for Audi, I had a feeling that the interior of SQ6 is somehow not as nice as gas-powered Audis  
**Polestar 3:** I haven't tested-driven it yet as I have had many problems with my Volvo in the past. Are there any users of Polestar 3 here?   
**Tesla Model X:** I loved it. Its range is great, and the charging infrastructure is amazing, too. However, it's the most expensive one here, and my friends who bought Teslas often complain about sloppy finishing (I saw both nicely fitted Teslas and ones that were scary to look at) servicing the car, even under warranty. 

Nice haves: 

- Autopilot or a really good adaptive cruise control  
- An option to leave the dogs inside with AC on (I'm in Austin, TX)  
- Large (f)trunk  
- Good charging infrastructure

Must haves: 

- Reliable  
- Good service centers 

I'd love to hear your opinion if you own or drive any of these cars or if you have an alternative that you think is worth test driving. 

Thanks! "

Tesla MS v Rivian R1T v Lucid Air
Model S v R1T v Lucid Air

Listen, I know one of these is not like the other, but I am considering all of them as my next car. I currently have a Model YLR and am looking to upgrade. 

Truthfully, the stalkless driving of the MS pisses me off. Can I get used to it? Of course I can but thats not the point, its stupid! But I do love the car besides that, having test driven it. 

The R1T I have always loved. I know people call it ugly but I love that uggo. I’m not a truck guy, but I don’t care I love this thing. 

The Lucid Air I admittingly know the least about, but I see their air credit incentives and they look too good to be true.

Which will live longer - 10 year old Tesla S or 4 year old Bolt EV?
I have saved up $15,000 to buy my 1st EV, and I plan to drive it into the ground, just like I've done with my 20 year old Scion. I have been leaning towards a 2019-20 Bolt EV Premier because it is small and cheap and practical. But today an opportunity arose to buy a 2015 Tesla Model S from a guy I kinda know, and now I'm confused.

In my area I can choose from used 2019-2020 Bolt Premier EVs from the dealer with tax credit for $15,000. Most seem to have 20,000-30,000 miles already and batteries that have been replaced in the past 2 years. They will include the manufacturer's 10 year / 100,000 mile warranty, their capabilities are a good match for my commute, I can charge at home, and it's what I've been planning to do, until ...

I was given the opportunity to buy a 2015 Tesla Model S for my $15,000 budget. It has 115,000 miles and is no longer under any warranty. It would be a private sale from a guy who's taken very good care of it. I've never wanted to be a Tesla person, just a practical commuter who's trying to save gas money and reduce my carbon impact. I like a tiny car that's easy to park and hard to worry about. But I drove the Tesla today, and it sure is nice in a land-yacht kind of way. We have another ICE car for road trips, so the Bolt wouldn't hold us back, but if I had a Tesla I would absolutely road trip in it. I'm also a little embarrassed at how much I liked the Auto Pilot feature. Kelly Blue Book says this car's Fair market range is between $17,800-$21,200, so it feels like a good deal maybe.

I'm trying to stay focused on my primary goal of getting the longest lasting car I can for my budget. I am concerned about the cost of fixing the Tesla if things do go wrong, vs having at least 8 more years of warranty coverage for the Bolt. I am curious about the expected lifespan of these cars, and I know we don't have the data yet. So I'm looking for advice and anecdotes and the thoughts of other EV drivers about durability and long term reliability of either of these cars. What would you do, if this car was going to be the last one you owned for a long time?"

EV Newbie Questions
Hi everyone,

Middle class here and looking to buy an EV. I am worried about sudden battery replacement costs when buying either an older EV or higher mileage EV. EV's sound appealing because the gas costs (of 300-400/mo) essentially would be replaced by most of my car payment, even if payments are 500-600/mo...IF IT LASTS THAT LONG. My car budget maxes out at $25,000, but if it is an EV with no 4wd or AWD I'd rather spend $15,000 max. 

On the pro-hybrid side of me, it seems hybrid re-sell value is higher. Also for me personally, obviously there's more moving part in a hybrid, but you can still drive a Prius on ""gas only"" until you buy a $1500 replacement battery from Green Bean, even if all warranties, full coverage insurance, etc are not an option. That's not bad.

For me, the oil changes and other maintenance of a hybrid pays off if I'm not suddenly stuck either: 

A)paying full coverage insurance the entire time I own the car

OR

B)Buying a new battery costing $10-15k (I wouldn't have money for or would be a pretty penny) and  having to pay to rent a car while being repaired if I don't have full coverage anymore. 

I have a decent savings account but not enough to suddenly buy a 10-15k battery. I would obviously need full coverage if getting a loan, but my goal is to pay off as soon as possible to NOT have full coverage. 

If I am wrong please correct me. I haven't been in the car buying industry for 5 years and things have drastically changed...have semi dabbled in EV's/Hybrids for the past 2 weeks while realizing I desperately need a new car. 

  
Recommendations? Has anyone been stuck in this situation? What helped you make a decision? Having two cars with dual purposes? Paying of an EV first, then getting another gas/hybrid? Any responses appreciated, including vehicle recommendations. Safety scores for crashes and reliability is of top priority for any car I will buy.

Hoping I've missed something. 
I've been keeping an eye on EVs -- prices, progress with range, Consumer Reports reviews etc -- for a couple of years now. I know I generally want one. And in the past couple of months I've really dug in, as I have two cars that I'm ready to replace. **After my research, I fear that the car I want just doesn't exist in this market yet.** I've checked the wiki here, and below, I'll answer the questions listed in the purchasing advice guidelines. I would greatly appreciate any thoughts. I'm not a high-end luxury car kind of guy. I just want something reliable, either pure electric or PHEV, probably low 40k or below in cost, for my 10-mile (one way) commute, in the Syracuse NY area. **Basically, what I want is a PHEV or electric version of a Toyota Camry -- a highly reliable, solidly reviewed, reasonably comfortable $40ish K car with nice, basic amenities (touch screen, safe driving adds, etc).** So the closest Ive come has been the Prius Prime and the Rav 4 Prime. I really, really wanted to like the Prius Prime, but when I test drove the redesigned 2024, I was surprised how much I didn't like it. My main complaint was that the redesign took a couple of inches off the window height, and i thought that, combined with the low profile of the car to begin with, left me with really poor visibility. I test drove a 21 Prime and it was ok -- just kinda of boxy and sluggish and left me uninspired. And the Rav 4 Prime is a good vehicle, but it's a little bigger then I wanted.

I notice many of the more expensive EVs get poor marks for reliability from reviewers, so I'm not that tempted to go up in price anyway.

I plan to test drive the Ioniq 6 today or next weekend. Generally, I've observed that Kia (except for the EV6, which I also plan to test drive) and Hyundai (except maybe for the Ioniq 6) get poor reliability scores. Honda and Subaru, who always do well on reliability and value, don 't have a current plug-in. I'm increasingly left with the option of buying a Prime or waiting another year or two until the car I want -- and I have to imagine others want -- is on market.

Basically looking for advice on any cars that you think I should be considering. Especially wondering if there are any specific years/makes of used I should consider -- maybe I'm missing something that has been discontinued?

Thank you so much, in advance, for any tips!

**\[1\] Your general location:** Syracuse, NY area. Long, cold winters.

**\[2\] Your budget in $, €, or £:** up to $45k new, also researching used, ideally around $30k.

**\[3\] The type of vehicle you'd prefer:** electric or PHEV compact to sedan. Could consider small SUV but larger than I want.

**\[4\] Which cars have you been looking at already?:** Prius Prime, Rav 4 Prime, Ioniq

**\[5\] Estimated timeframe of your purchase:** As soon as I can find something I like

**\[6\] Your daily commute, or average weekly mileage:** 10 miles one way, so 20 miles total daily.

**\[7\] Your living situation — are you in an apartment, townhouse, or single-family home?** Single family home with wired attached garage.

**\[8\] Do you plan on installing charging at your home?** Not sure, looking for advice.

**\[9\] Other cargo/passenger needs — do you have children/pets?:** Two teens and a very spazzy beagle, but not highly relevant for this car.

Need Advice: Tesla Model 3 vs. Volkswagen ID4 for Uber Driving in Jordan
Hey Reddit community,

I'm seeking some advice on a big decision I need to make. I'm looking to start working with Uber in Jordan, and I'm torn between two electric cars: the Tesla Model 3 (2021) and the Volkswagen ID4 (2021).

I've done some research, but I'd love to hear from those who have experience or insights into these vehicles, especially considering my specific circumstances.

Here's a bit about my situation:

Location: I live in Jordan, so I need a car that can handle the climate and driving conditions here.

Work Schedule: I'll be driving around after work six to seven hours, six times a week. So, the car needs to be reliable and comfortable for long hours on the road.

My budget is around 22000 euro. And I'll be installing a charger at home. 

Would love to hear your thoughts 

Thanks on advance "

What is the best electric car you can buy?
I am looking into buying an electric car. Drive 8 miles to work and only criteria is 4 doors and room for rear facing car seats. For this purpose if you google ""whats the best electric car?"" what would come up?

&#x200B;

Edit: I should elaborate a little. I was trying to see if there was a trend based on overall but other things to take into consideration are; Depreciation, reliability and less than $40,000. I am cautious of Tesla for reliability and price is high, even used. Id like this paid off in 3 years and currently have a car payment of $956 a month. Keeping it similar or less is ideal. "

Hi fellow EV enthusiasts,

I'm looking to leap into the electric vehicle world with a second-hand car, and I would love your guidance! Our family's daily commute is around 20 miles, with occasional trips ranging from 50 to 200 miles. We need a reliable EV for motorway driving. I am based in UK.

Our budget is under £10k or £200/month. Charging is not an issue as we have a driveway, but I'm unsure about the costs of the charging pod. Additionally, I'm wondering whether to go for a tethered or non-tethered pod.

Any recommendations on reliable second-hand models, insights into charging pod costs, and thoughts on the tethered vs. non-tethered dilemma would be highly appreciated.

Thanks in advance for your valuable advice! 🚗⚡️"

My 4 Years of EV ownership
Hey guys and gals, just discovered this group and thought I'd come share my thoughts after 4 years of EV ownership! My name is Eric, I live on Vancouver Island in British Columbia Canada. I'm a EV certified automotive red seal technician, and my 2015 Kia Soul EV + has to be one of the best cars I've owned.

I bought it almost exactly 4 years ago with about 94,000kms from a Mini dealer in Vancouver when I had been living in the area. I had been driving a 1988 Chevrolet Caprice that I spent a lot of time and money on, fixing and restoring it, and had even put in a 370hp SBC crate engine into it (still wasn’t very fast btw). I was starting to get a little bit tired of constantly having to deal with constant old car things like leaky weather strips and the fuel bill. I realized that potential car payments and insurance would be less than it would be to keep fixing and filling the fuel tank on my Caprice.

I started looking at cheap used EVs, and at the time, the only vehicles that were under $20k were the Nissan Leaf, Smart For2 Electrics, Fiat 500e exported from the states, and the Kia Soul. The Fiat didn’t have a warranty as a result of being a vehicle from the states, and the Smart didn’t have DCFC (The Fiat doesn’t have it either). That left the Leaf and the Soul and my only real options. Looking into it, there was a clearly superior vehicle. The Soul, and while info was a bit limited, it looked pretty good. I liked the larger interior space, they were available with heated and ventilated leather (None of the others had this), and had an generous 8 year/160k km warranty. 

I went out searching and ended up buying cheapest one I could find that was close to me, turned out to be perfect. It had a clean title, had the + package (Luxury for the USA), but it was not equipped with a sunroof. I know a lot of people like sunroofs, but I’ve had to clear way too many sunroof drains and quote too many $8k sunroof frame replacement jobs at my dealer job for my comfort. They are the bane of my existence and I pity people that have to pay to fix them.

The vehicle was far from perfect. The car had come from Vancouver Island, and I have the sneaking suspicion that somebody must have been using it as a parcel delivery vehicle because of 2 reasons. Firstly, the vehicle was a little beat up. It has scratches on the hood from somebody dragging the charging cable across it, dents in the door jams from the driver closing the door on the seat belt buckle, and has some broken interior panels. The second reason is that unbeknownst to me at the time (I had very limited EV experience at the time) the high voltage battery was effectively cooked when I got it from the dealer and only had 90km of range. I was okay with all of this given the price of the vehicle.

I had been living in Vancouver at the time, so me and a buddy went on a short trip to Squamish to celebrate my new purchase. Going there wasn’t an issue and we charged there, but heading back we unexpectedly had a 30km range drop, and had to limp to the nearest level 2 charger as there were no level 3 stations within range. We charged it enough to get us to the next level 3 and got home after. 

I took it to the Kia dealer and I had the high voltage battery replaced under warranty for free. However sadly I got the same 27.5 kWh put back in (Oh well, it was free) instead of the 30 kWh packs that some other owners reported getting put in theirs, but I was back in business with 165km range. I was super excited about the range I had just gained, so in addition to using the vehicle exclusively for commuting, but I started slowly pushing the limits of the vehicle and it’s range. I’ve been really good about keeping the battery between 20-80% SOC, but I haven’t exactly been shy of straying and charging to 100% once a week or so. I started using the Torque app combined with imported data PIDS courtesy of APRP on my phone that I connected to the vehicle using an OBD2 dongle I had on hand already and started monitor vehicle status. Battery read 110% SOH at this point in the vehicle’s life.

I ended up having to move to Vancouver Island during the pandemic for a job opportunity, and I’ve been doing a 66km round trip commute 5 days a week for a little over 3 years now, I end up putting about 25,000kms a year on the vehicle (It currently has about 191,000kms), and it’s been pretty good reliability wise. I had to replace the onboard charger (OBC) out of warranty for about $2000 CDN at about 170,000km, but even with a failed on board charger, I was still able to charge the vehicle at a level 3 station as it bypasses the OBC.

The vehicle had aftermarket 16” rims and new tires on it when I bought it, but I ended up damaging the tire on a pothole. The other tires were getting down to about 40%, so I opted to buy a new set of 18” rims and high performance Continental tires for it, and I installed a good set of winter tires on the old rims for winter use later that year. The 18” rims ended up cutting my range by about 25kms, but the range sacrifice was worth it in my opinion.

Not only do I love the looks of them, but the handling of the vehicle is significantly improved. Before I replaced the rims I had taken the vehicle to Vancouver Island Motorsport Circuit through the company I was working for at the time and took it around the track for the afternoon, the biggest limiting factor going around corners turned out to be the tires folding under themselves when going around corners hard. It was honestly really frustrating because I could tell the car had more to give. It had a good amount of body roll, but less than you may expect given then battery placement. But ultimately it was just limited by the tires. That being said, I was actually able to pass a couple Mk7 Golf GTI’s that were running the circuit with me when we got to the corners. And yes I was very nauseous after haha

I ended up driving it from Nanaimo to Prince George late spring last year to see family along a 1,588km round trip, staying in Kamloops overnight to visit other family. I’ve always known the car is more of a city commuter, not a road trip king, but I did the trip just to prove that it could do it. And it did! It however definitely struggled. The new 145km summer range meant I had to stop at 24 total DCFC stations on my entire trip, and we all know if there’s one thing EV batteries don’t like it’s constant fast charging and the heat that comes with it. I ended up learning a bunch of stuff about battery cooling on the vehicle.

I learned that there’s an air intake under both of the front seats that is sucked in my a fan located in the cargo area where the spare would normally be. That air is sucked in and is directed in between the pouch style battery cells (Didn’t know the Soul used this style of battery, all other EVs I know of use laptop style cells) to cool the battery. Cooling the battery this way was Kia’s biggest mistake. Air cooling is not sufficient to cool a battery for multiple DCFC sessions. The first couple charges aren’t too big of a deal, but by the end of the 3rd charge the battery was already above 40°c. It’s at this temperature that the vehicle turns the cooling fan to max and starts dialing back the charge rate, but temps continue to climb with the charge rate being turned down and down as to not damage the EV battery.

So I came up with a partial “Fix”, and that term really does belong in quotations. I turned the A/C to max, directed the air flow to the feet, took a couple old Glosette boxes and modified it so that the rear passenger foot vent air was directed into the battery cooling intakes. But did it work? In a word, sorta. It only was able to bring battery temps down by a couple extra degrees by the next charging station (I needed more like 10°c), but it was able to keep the battery temp from rising as fast compared to before, but ultimately the same result occurred. Was it worth it and would I recommend other Soul EV owners do the same? Absolutely not. It was more of an experiment than anything to see if I could make the journey any easier. What ended up helping the most was reducing the speed at which I drove at on the freeway as to put less of a strain on the EV battery. Despite all of this, I’m glad it had the air cooling. I would imagine the same trip with similar range Leaf and it’s non-cooled battery would  probably have failed to make the trip. But that’s pure speculation.

Fast forward to today on the opposite side of things, we just experienced a cold snap and got temps as cold as -10°c . While not super cold compared for much of Canada, it’s still pretty cold for us here on the island. My battery was reading as low as 0° (My apartment has an underground so it only spend 9 hours outside that day while it was parked at work) and range dipped to about 120km. It’s during this time of year that I get to use one of my favourite features, climate scheduling. I plug in at home and at work, set the timer for when I need to leave, and get into a warm and cozy car. Obviously not as fancy as those of you on here with app connected vehicles, but it’s fine given the age of the vehicle and the fact it doesn’t require a subscription leaves me quite happy.

Now at 190,000kms, it's still managed to maintain 110% SOH. I honestly have no idea how it’s gone almost 100,000kms and it's not only still above the rated comp city, it's maintained it. I’m thrilled honestly. I keep drooling at some of these new EVs, the Polestar 2 really catches my attention. But I keep driving this little Kia trouble free kilometer after trouble free kilometer and it makes me kinda love it and makes me wanna keep it. Even my partner has warmed up to it. He absolutely hated it when he first set his eyes upon it saying he hated the styling, but once he started to drive it and learn why I chose it he started to realize it was a pretty good car. Overall, I’m glad I took the risk. If I had to do it again, I definitely would. 10/10 ownership experience"

What should be my first non-sedan EV?
We are a family of 3.  I want my first EV to be a hatchback or an SUV that we can use for errands, weekend outings and short trips that have an utmost round trip distance of 200 miles.  

I can use a level 1 or install a level 2 home charger.  I am considering a used EV that would just run and I need not worry about maintenance.   Reliability, less road noise, at least 250 miles of EPA rated range and some comfort is all I am looking for."

Is the electric scooter best compared to the petrol scooter?
 

The question of whether an electric scooter is the best choice compared to a petrol scooter depends on various factors, including individual preferences, specific needs, and the local context. Both types of scooters have their own advantages and disadvantages, and the ""best"" option varies based on the user's priorities and the prevailing conditions in their area. Let's consider some factors to help you make an informed decision:

1. Environmental impact: If reducing your carbon footprint and contributing to a cleaner environment are important to you, then an electric scooter is a better choice. Electric scooters produce zero tailpipe emissions, while petrol scooters emit pollutants that contribute to air pollution and climate change.

2. Cost-effectiveness: Electric scooters generally have lower operating costs than petrol scooters. Electricity is often cheaper than petrol, leading to potential savings in the long run. However, the initial purchase cost of an electric scooter may be higher.

3. Range and charging infrastructure: If you have access to a reliable charging infrastructure and your daily commuting distances are within the electric scooter's range, then an electric scooter may be suitable. However, if you regularly need to travel long distances without access to charging stations, a petrol scooter with its longer range and quick refueling might be more practical.

4. Noise pollution: Electric scooters operate quietly compared to petrol scooters, which can be beneficial if you are concerned about noise pollution in your area.

5. Maintenance: Electric scooters generally have fewer moving parts and require less maintenance than petrol scooters, which can lead to cost savings and less hassle.

6. Government incentives and regulations: Some regions offer incentives such as subsidies, tax benefits, or reduced registration fees to promote the adoption of electric vehicles. If such incentives are available in your area, an electric scooter might become a more attractive option.

7. Infrastructure and availability: Consider the availability of charging stations and petrol stations in your region. In some places, charging infrastructure may be limited, which could affect the practicality of owning an electric scooter.

8. Personal preference: Ultimately, your personal preferences, values, and lifestyle should play a significant role in your decision. Test-riding both types of scooters can help you gauge their performance and comfort.

In summary, there is no definitive answer to whether an electric scooter is always the best choice compared to a petrol scooter. It depends on your specific needs, the infrastructure and incentives available in your area, and your environmental considerations. Both types of scooters have their merits, and the decision should be based on what aligns best with your priorities and circumstances.

Outlander PHEV now vs BEV SUV later
Just got word that a Mitsubishi 2023 GT premium model will be available for me in 2 months or so.  I’ve been on the waitlist since fall 2022, so exciting news.  I really liked the interior — I found it nicer than the Rav4 prime inside.

I’m really struggling with the decision to get this vehicle now and enjoy it for 2-3 years before going full EV, or waiting a bit longer to get a full EV SUV.

I’ve got a reliable 2018 Honda CRV which is working fine.  There is a Canadian tax incentive for business electric vehicles I can use which will start going down next year too (100% write off vs 75% in 2024 and 2025).

Do people think these will hold their value fairly well in the short term?  Should I take the leap now or wait it out for more full EV models in the near future.   I can install a charger at home and most of my driving is city based, <60 km per day with the odd 100-200 km weekend trip.  In the summer we may do 3-4 trips that are closer to 300-400 km each way to cottage country in southern Ontario.

Thanks for your advice!"

Another terrible Electrify America experience to add
Went a different route home because I thought it would be faster to charge on a 350kw than the 150kw EvolveNY/Shell one that was more on the way.  I was very, very wrong. 

EA app and plugshare reported that stall 1 was down, and the three 350kw were open. When I arrived, stalls 2 and 3 seemed available and the screens were operational. Stall 1 was down and had an appropriate message. Stall 4 had a vehicle in it. The orientation of the stall screens were very odd too, being to the sides of the parked cars instead of at the head of the space. Stall 2 and 4 screens faced each other with two spaces in between but stall/screen 3 was facing the 4th single, right-most space outward where you would expect stall 4 to be facing. The vehicle that was plugged into stall 4 was in stall 3's spot, making it awkward for me to sandwich myself between the screen a stranger's car that smelled like smoke/ash from the outside. 

Since I have a free charging pass from a vehicle purchase, I had to use my phone to initiate the charge with the EA app. It took at least 2 minutes just to allow the app to start and load through various screens and layers despite having a full 5G connection around 12:30 AM. Once I finally got the map to load and the charger selected, I swiped to start and it kept hanging on initiation and not starting, before the stall told me to unplug and restart the session. I called the number to remotely start the session. 

After a few tries, she couldn't get it to start and had me switch from 2 to 3 with the same results. She tried restarting the stalls (which I couldn't confirm actually shut off and restarted.) She put me on hold at least three times to get help but the suggestions were completely useless like, ""is the car off and unlocked?"" I thought, that's what you put me on hold to come back and suggest?? Keep in mind I've had a headache for hours that had progressed into a migraine at this point. 

After an hour, the smelly, sketchy car left and I tried his stall before the representative could even suggest it. I did the initial thing I tried to do: open the app, select the charger, swipe to initiate. This time, it worked immediately. There was nothing the rep did or said or suggested I couldn't have done on my own and she had no idea what the problem actually was. However, this charger wouldn't go past 77-78kw despite being a 350kw charger being used on a Kia EV6 that supports charging over 200kw with a potential charge time of as little as 18 minutes from 10% to 80%. I was the only one charging.

That is why I was there: to save 20 minutes of time by fast charging here despite a longer route home. I was at 9% so it should have worked when I plugged in, but EA's crappy chargers didn't seem to recognize that the car can charge faster. It has worked in the past at a different location in a different state. I even tried waiting a couple minutes and restarting the charge because I have read that helped someone reach the correct speeds, to no avail.

In the end, it took almost an hour to start a charge that ended up charging SLOWER than the EvolveNY/Shell 150kw charger at Tops in LaGrangeville that I chose to forgo this time. I only spent 10 mins charging enough to get me home despite planning to charge most of the battery in that time using the 350kw nature of the charger. Otherwise what's the point?

EA needs to label that the only reliable charger at this site is charger number 4. Chargers 1-3 are down as far as I'm concerned.

Electrify America needs to get their shit together or they will delay and deter a lot of people moving to EVs.

In an attempt to save some time and charge up more in less time, I ended up adding an hour and a half to a 30 minute drive home.

Due to the exhaustion and migraine, I started getting car sick on the way back and had to pull over and puke on the side of the road. I almost didn't make it home in time before a second puke. It was so bad that today I needed to take a day off to recover from the experience, stinging throat and all. 

Relying on Electrify America is dangerous to your well-being. I would not recommend this location (Walmart in Newburgh) to anyone for a very long time. Be skeptical of any EA charger unless you know it's brand new or recently renovated. Even then..."

Looking for a very inexpensive, small or single occupant 4 wheeled EV - if possible AWD or at least FWD
 If you care to understand it, here's my situation. I already own an electric motorcycle - a Zero SR/S sport touring bike. It scratches the itch I have for a high performance vehicle and a summer vehicle, and it's an EV, which costs me very little to operate/maintain/fill. I live in WNY though, so for at least 1/4 of the year I can't ride it due to the snow and salt here. My wife's car is our family car (a Volvo XC60 Drive-E T6, that's twincharged), which solves our need for a long distance vehicle or something to move stuff, or just move the three of us around (I have a 2 year old), and is fun / quick in it's own right (enough to where between it and the bike, I don't really need a high performance car anymore).

I work from home now and will likely for the rest of my career. So I have very little need for a car now, as I have no commute. But every once in a while, I need to drive somewhere, to run a quick errand, fetch something from the store etc, while my wife is at work or has her car. I would normally use my bike for this, except on very rainy days, or snowy days. I don't want to spend a lot, as I hardly ever will use this car. Given the infrequent use, the short range I'd need, and the need to only move myself and a few items around, a cheap electric car seems like the way to go to me, especially since I'm already used to having an EV with my bike, and already have a good L2 J1772 charger at home. Having it be AWD would be ideal given the snow we get up here.

The thing is, the cheapest EV's I seem to be able to find used, are the older Nissan Leaf's, most of which will need a battery replacement right away, adding a few grand to the price. And even though the Leaf is small, it's still bigger than I really need. I have no need to carry passengers and the smallest trunk/hatch would be fine. And even at \~8 grand for an older Leaf, it's still more money than I want to spend on something I'd use so infrequently.

The Toyota C+pod is closer to what I was imagining - but it looks like it's only in Japan, and still quite pricey. I've seen some home built projects that seem like what I want, but I really don't have the time to build / work on project cars anymore.

Is there anything like I'm describing on the market? Especially used and cheap? What's the cheapest EV you've seen that can charge on L1 or L2 at home on J1772? Any options like this that are AWD? Anything you've seen on the horizon that may not be out yet?

It's seeming like my best option is to buy an old, reliable, gas car that can sit and won't require much maintenance. But I'd much rather an EV. Hoping you folks might have an option. thanks!"

Looking to go electric
Hey all,

My current car is on its last legs and I am debating moving over to electric, but I was hoping for some suggestions on a few things from those with some experience:

1. I have been looking at BYD as they are readily available and affordable where I am (Costa Rica) but I am struggling to find anyone who owns/ has owned one to give some honest review experience. If any of you have any experience on them I would love to hear particularly about:
- General Reliability of mechanical and electrical parts
- Power on steep hills
- Height clearance - head to scope the clearance of some of them and some of the roads here can be pretty rough so I want something with a decent bit of clearance.

2. I currently live in a 4th floor apartment. I have a parking space, but no outside electrical access. Aside from running a cable from my window all the way dow  the building, are there any other ideas of how to charge one. (I am buying a house within a year and moving, but in the meantime I am looking for options. My wife says the building rules say we can't run a cable sadly). 

Thanks in advance for any experiences you can share!"

Deciding between a Hyundai kona or ioniq or a Vauxhall mokka or DS3
Only looking at these cars bc they’re available on the motability scheme. I think I’m decided on an electric car but out of these anyone have any advice? 

Personal favourite is the mokka but it’s just because it has decent range and looks good rn. The back seems very cramped but would it matter if that’s used for kids anyway? 

DS I basically like the watchstrap seats and it’s not my top choice right now beyond that unless I fall in love on test drive by chance 

Kona seems decent range decent boot size, less attractive than the mokka but still cramped in the back maybe less than the mokka tho?

Ioniq seems the most boring looking but reliable and roomy and maybe the height difference being lower won’t make as much difference to me as I think… thought SUV mostly bc bending is painful for me 

I’m going to be looking at entry level models and can’t seem to find any reviews on YouTube on those models because everyone reviews the highest spec of a model and I want to find out what I would be missing on the entry level model to what they’re talking about… I mean a reverse parking camera would be ideal etc but I can’t necessarily afford the advance on the higher spec models so finding out what the entry level models have would be wonderful if I could before going to test drive since it might change my shortlist altogether

I won’t actually drive that much bc of my disability like a long journey wouldn’t really be anything more than very occasional with tons of stops needed anyway that could charge in and most weeks it would be a to hospital or supermarket or drop a kid off car so boot space for rollator and comfort and safety are my priorities but then style might sway me if little is between them"

Considering Used Tesla S vs New Kia Niro
I am looking for a new vehicle this summer after I finish a cross country move to Seattle. I want to go electric and need something with enough room for a car seat behind a tall driver and ideally enough range for a snoqualmie pass ski day (\~120mi, 3k ft elevation in the cold). We also have a Q7 for long trips and towing.  My last car was a BMW 325 wagon, manual with no screen and I am not a techie.

My top choices right now are a used Tesla S or a New Kia Niro on lease. 

Looking at the market, I can get a 2015 S85D in the mid 30s which seems reasonable and like a good point on the depreciation curve.  I don't care about the autopilot features but want a reliable comfortable car. With the MCU recall it seems safe to buy a MCU1 car with AP1 feature wise. What should I watch out for on these or is it a pretty safe purchase? Where are the best place to buy? I have driven a Y but not an S, it was nice but the lead time on the new cars plus the removal of the standard range Y pushed it out of contention.  The 3 seems like it would be tight inside from when I sat in one and is still a long wait to buy.

The Kia would be a new lease, currently at \~$300/m, when I sold the BMW earlier this year these were closer to $200-250/m and was the leading option. The market prices have gone up and I am less excited at the new price. I have driven one and it was fine but not anything special.

I might consider a leaf if I find one for really cheap, a standard battery would cover everything but skiing which I can live with. You have to buy an SV+tech to get lumbar support which is hard to find a deal on.

Last option is buying something cheap to use until the market settles down and see what prices look like next year on VWId4 AWD, Q4 etron, Ioniq 5 and EV6.  

Any inputs on these options?  I am kind of leaning towards the used S but finding a good one might be a challenge."

EV Charging Station Recommendations Needed!
I work for a real estate developer. My boss wants to install a few dual EV chargers in the basement of our new-build apartment building. He does not want to invest in Tesla superchargers (too expensive), but wants to buy a fast, reliable alternative instead. Does anyone have a recommendation for a good dual charging station? Also, renters whose buildings offer EV charging: Is this normally “free” (read: the cost is built into everyone’s parking cost) or do electric car owners pay an additional fee? We would like a product that would allow us to get some rebate of some sort."

New Plug-in Hybrids - experiences? Trying to plan and decide.
I've narrowed down my new car search to plug-in hybrids.   


Background: I want the green functionality of electric, but my current situation demands I have a backup for when I can't charge at my rental or need to drive out-of-state to see family. Long-term, I'll be a homeowner again and my commutes should be within the range to utilize the shorter electric range of these models.

I'll be trading in a 2004 Corolla with 165,000 miles on it that I bought new and slapped a Pioneer Carplay system into; I drive my cars a lot of years. I'm not that picky on looks or stuff. I want a car that's comfortable, reliable, good for the environment, and safe (e.g., not [spontaneous fires](https://www.theverge.com/2019/5/16/18627746/tesla-fire-battery-software-update-model-s-x)...). And, not looking to fork out a fortune.  


Some I'm considering (but I'm open to others):  
\- Toyota Prius Prime  
\- Chrysler Pacifica plug-in hybrid  
\- Hyundai Ioniq  
\- Kia Niro  


Anyone own any of these (or other) plug-in hybrids that you like and recommend? What do you love/hate about yours? I'd love to hear experiences."

Opinions of Chevy Bolt?
Don't know anything, really, about cars or reviews. Just interested in an all electric car that has a 200+ mile range, and can't afford a Tesla.

Here's a positive review in [MotorTrend](http://www.motortrend.com/news/chevrolet-bolt-2017-car-of-the-year-finalist/) but have no idea how to contextualize it. How reliable a source is MotorTrend, for example?

Also trying to get a sense of the car's safety (we have 2 small children). Any info out on that?

And as long as am asking questions: I've heard that while in the short-term there is a cost savings due to gas, oil, etc. Long-term the costs of maintaining an electric car nets out to about the same as a non-electric car, due to the infrequent but expensive need to replace batteries on occasion. Any thoughts on this as well?

Thanks all for your advice for an electric car newbie! Any other advice or info is welcome."

Private Use of Public Charging Stations Could Spoil the Electric Vehicle Market
Car manufacturers sold almost twice as many electric vehicles in 2014 as they did between 2010 and 2013. We went from 320,000 electric cars on the roads in 2013 to more than 740,000 at the end of 2014. The EV market is currently exploding, and with it the need for electric charging stations.

Public charging stations are popping up everywhere, from Australia to New Jersey. But what about private stations? Most early adopters of electric vehicles were home owners. They had the resources and ability to install private chargers in their garage. Now that the market extends to a larger public, we see more and more EV owners who live in condos or apartment complexes. How can they set up their own charging station?

Providers such as ChargePoint recommend Property Managers to install public chargers in private parking. While this solution can be quick and easy, it is in the long run an expensive and inefficient one. Here’s why.

Public charging stations are not reliable: Let’s take the example of a building with 50 apartments and the same number of parking spaces. The solution offered by public charging providers is to block a few parking spots to install stations on. Property managers then turn these spots into “community parking for electric vehicles”. 

This setup will work well when only a few residents own electric cars. They can share the stations without conflict. But what happens when 10, 20, 30 residents own an electric vehicle? They will have to compete to get a spot, making it stressful and inefficient for everyone. 

You may think that the answer to this problem is to add “community chargers”. But when adding chargers, property managers will face a second, more important problem:

Public charging stations don’t scale: While Level 1 charging stations are enough for hybrid vehicles, electric vehicles usually need Level 2 charging stations. Level 2 chargers use 240 volts and cut the charging time by about one-half compared with 120 volt charging. Level 2 EV chargers require 30-40 amps to operate. 

Buildings have a finite amount of power when constructed. Since they weren’t built with EV charging in mind its common for a property to only have 100-150 amps of power available for EV charging. 

That’s easy math: A building with 100 amps available will not be able to power more than 3 public chargers. Once available power is used to facilitate more chargers ,the building may have to invest in transformers or bringing in new service to the building Adding new service is prohibitively expensive and requires major building work.

The Solution: Intelligent Charging Stations

EV owners don’t need to charge their car all the time. Some may need to charge it at night, while others only need to charge on the weekends. Yet a traditional charger will block the power it needs to be operational at all times. Whether a car is being charged or not.

The solution is to make charging stations more “intelligent”. A smart EV charger network can distribute the power between several chargers and manage supply based on usage. Each resident can have their own dedicated charger and receive power when they need it. Property managers can install more chargers without having to upgrade their electric infrastructure immediately.

Where to find Smart EV Charging Stations?

EverCharge is the first provider of smart EV chargers. Our network of charging stations learns from residents’ usage to intelligently distribute power. Using EverCharge, property managers can install up to 12 chargers on just 100 amps. That’s 9 more than what could be done using public chargers. We limit costs while keeping all residents happy.

We now live in a world where sustainable development has become a necessity to slow down climate change. Switching from motor to electric vehicles is one of the most important steps towards this goal. Yet the results of this major change will be tarnished if we are not able to distribute power more efficiently. EverCharge can help make a difference at our humble scale, and we hope you’ll join us."

Why Electric Cars Are More Than Just a Trend
Electric cars have made traveling so much easier. They are silent and are paving the way to new means of mobility all throughout the world.

Limited Maintenance Costs

A car powered on electricity has fewer parts that are subject to wear and tear than a traditional car. Result? You will hardly ever have to make repairs, saving you tons of money in the long run. No servicing, no need to go to the garage to fix an issue, and braking less harshly result in the electric car making the best deal for the average man.

Quieter Towns & Roads

No sound! The electric vehicle… we won’t hear it coming. And probably won’t be as exposed to the noise pollution it is freeing us from. Having quieter cities will improve your quality of life and the quality of life of the wildlife. It will also prevent you from getting sick. Did you know that noise pollution has resulted in hospitals being busier because it has been directly linked with diseases such as obesity, heart attacks, and headaches?

At Home I Can Charge. How Practical!

No need to leave your house to go fill up your car every other week! The electric car can be recharged in your own garage. An adapter in the wall it only needs down time overnight to be good to go by morning. If you refuse to settle for any less than your favorite espresso coffee, your best start of the day or you can do without the danger of fainting when collided with a stranger driving towards you, bear in mind that convenience starts at home.

Conclusion

An electric car not only provides clean energy but gives you also more peace, and more money.

My first and last Tesla
Today I sold my first EV, a 2018 Tesla Model X, and tomorrow I pick up a new BMW iX eDrive50.  When I bought my Tesla, I was excited to experience such  amazing innovation, dramatically reduce my carbon footprint, and drive such a cool looking car.  Then, the quality issues started to emerge for me, and it became apparent that Tesla/Musk has, IMO, a laser focus on self-driving, not necessarily making a better and safer car that happens to run on electricity.  And I found myself unconvinced by Elon’s arguments that Tesla’s self-driving tech is not endangering people. Then, the anti-union stuff started happening.  Then, Musk started using his money and influence to undermine American democracy and spread techno-utopian libertarian BS.  So, with that, I can’t begin to tell you how good feels to have found such a great alternative to Tesla, although it took time.  Yes, I know about the BMW founders’ NAZI ties, and I know about its efforts to avoid unionization in the US.  But, for now, I know I’m buying a car made with union labor and designed by engineers paid to make better cars, not sell me on some Jetsons fantasy about self-driving cars. Yes, we’ll have them someday, but I sure as hell won’t be buying one from Tesla.  I hope those of you out there dying to buy your first EV will give BMW a look.  I test drove them all, and BMW stands out if driving performance and car build quality are a priority for you.  Yes, there are aspects of the Model X I’ll miss. It was my first EV experience and a very cool ride, for a while. But I can’t begin to get behind the wheel of my new BMW iX.  "

EvDuty Level 2 Users
Hi,

I have the EVDuty 40 for home. Quick setup and it’s set to private. Paired easily with my phone. I just got a new Kona EV, and the first time plugging in, I realized I had to “start” charging on the EVDuty app for it to send to the car. Now even though I have the Kona scheduled for off peak hours, do I need to always open the EVDuty app and “start charging” even though the car won’t start actually charging hours later? Nothing in the app shows a way to schedule in synch with the car. Ideas would be helpful. Thanks. "

Tritium vs ABB
Hey, I haven’t been able to find any discussion on this but I’m wondering what the ins and outs are between the different DCFC manufacturers. 

In New Zealand we have one network called charge net and they don’t like the ABB ones, but didn’t explain why. 
When I asked they said something along the lines of 

“I’ve explained to them in great detail why I won’t use your chargers” 

So I’m wondering if there’s anyone here who’s familiar with the features of both and can explain why anyone possibly might feel that way.

From a users point of view, I can say that I prefer the ABB units because they have an AC plug and also offer units with 43kw AC cables, but the socket is handy if someone else is charging on chadimo, you can plug in on AC until they’re finished.
Also if someone is on Chadimo and you want to use the CCS connector for example, it will automatically start you charging when they’re finished!"

SEAT Ibiza 1.2 FR 2014
Hi all. I currently own a SEAT Ibiza 1.2 FR 2014.

I bought the car used in November last year with 63,000 miles on the clock.

The car seemly drove fine for around 4 weeks before going into limp mode and two amber lights visible on the dash (ABS and ESC). I took the car back to the dealership and they reported that the throttle body was at fault. They claimed to have replaced the throttle body and the car was handed back to me.

The car drove fine again for around 4 weeks before going back into limp mode. Amber lights on the dash for emission control system this time and ESC. I took the car to a reputable garage and again they reported that the throttle body was at fault. They replaced the throttle body and informed me that the dealership never replaced it when it broke down previously. The garage gave me the throttle body they took out of my car and is clearly not new.

Following this, my car worked again for around 4 weeks and has just broken down again and gone into limp mode. This time amber light just for ESC. I will be taking my car back to the garage and have a years warranty with the throttle body they replaced.

Does anyone have any idea what could actually be at fault? Have I just bought a lemon? I am tempted to just sell the car once it has been fixed and find something else."

Is this a fair quote for replacing Alternator for a 07 Camry?
Hi, my 2007 2.4L camry broke down recently and I had to tow it to the nearest AAA car center because most other places were too busy because of the holiday. The road assistance guy mentioned that it should be a fairly easy job for a camry and shouldn’t come up that high. However, I was quoted 1050 to change the alternator, serp belt and the battery. They later called and slashed it down to 950 saying they found a different alternator(REMAN) - I don’t want to spend this high on a pretty old car with 170k miles. 

I looked up the part online and it looks like they are charging quite a bit for the alternator. I need to either tow it back to my place or a different auto shop by today if I don’t want it fixed there. But all other shops I was thinking of getting another quote seems to be closed for thanksgiving. Any recommendations? "

If anyone has any opinions about any of this  I would really appreciate it 

( my last option would be to take it to the dealer ship which I want to do anything but that it would be extremely expensive. )"

Advice 
I bought a car in an emergency effort for $2800. 2005 Volkswagen Beetle It broke down 3 months later, in the parking lot of an oil change place. Should I attempt to tow it away and fix it (unknown cost) or sell it for scrap at $500? For additional context I will be in Europe for 4 months and won't need a car at all. Upon returning I will be in my final semester of college and technically don't need a car then either. My parents also strongly disapproved of my car originally, and this will be proving then right, which I hate. They arent technically right because they disapprove of a car that I bought a year ago. This is an identical car that I bought to replace it without telling them. (Car accident) My car is overheating badly, and is leaking both coolant and oil. My window also doesnt roll fully up. What should I Do? "

Scratch Repair
Anyone know how much this would cost roughly to fix in the UK? Believe it’s been a stone when driving and it’s broke the paint so T-Cut won’t take it out.

Bit of context - selling my car and the dealership said they’d take some money off what they’d give me for it because of this as it would need sanded down, repainted and blended back with the bodywork and because of the location it’s also more awkward, so would be good to know how much it would cost to compare with how much they’re taking off for it if they’ll tell me that.

TIA 👍🏼"

Alternator issues
So I had my 95 lincoln town car broken into and the steering column torn up. I got that completely replaced about 2 weeks ago. Then it broke down after squeeking real bad and the mechanic says its the alternator. Its the same guy who replaced the steering column. Do you guys think the alternator issues could have been caused by the steering column replacement? Background: the towncar has been in someones garage for the better part of 15 years. 115k miles on it and i put 15k myself. Most mechanics are suprised by how good the inner workings look. "

$28000 car engine replacement?
I drive a 2014 BMW X1 (purchased August 2023 for just over $20000). It broke down this week. 

I've been told that the engine timing chain is broken and it needs a full engine replacement. I've been quoted $28082.46! Parts vs labour are not itemised on the quote.

I have a third party warranty which covers $5000 for engine problems. So not quite enough lol

Is this a normal price? Is there any hope for me getting my money back for the car or fixing it for less?

I am feeling like I've been scammed but I don't know if I have any options for saving this situation. Any thoughts? 🙏🏻

Repair Shop ""Storage Fee?""
Hi, I'm not very informed on cars and have no idea where to ask this question, but seeing as this subreddit seems to have people knowledgeable I figured I'd ask it here.

Long story short, my boyfriend's car broke down and he had to take it to the Toyota dealership to repair it. He works long hours and hasn't been able to pick it up.

Is it likely for there to be some sort of storage fee?

I know some dealerships have a 10 or so day window to pick up cars bought off the lot. I know some repair shops have this same policy. He dropped it off March 21st. 

He did get a call about the car. The call was odd and quick and we were both kind of confused by the end of it. But when he said the car was in the shop and fixed and he hasn't been able to pick it up the lady on the phone sort of just said alright have a great day and hung up.

You'd think if this were something to be charged for they'd tell us over the phone when they called... right? Or am I just depending too heavily on benefit of the doubt and he's more likely to have a fat fee to pay when he can get over there? 😓"

Does the clutch need replacing when the gearbox is replaced?
My car (2012 Hyundai i10) broke down today, and the breakdown recovery man reckons it's a problem with the gearbox. We then took it into a garage, and the guy there was saying the clutch will need replacing too, even though the clutch is only 2 months old. He was saying that the clutch can get contaminated by the oil leaking from the gearbox, and that whenever the gearbox gets replaced it's best to replcae the clutch too. Does this seem right, or is it likely he's trying to upsell? He said this without having looked at the car himself, since it was almost closing time. I've just moved to the area so don't know which garages are the most reliable."

Mazda3 engine breathing?
So my car has a lot of issues that I am aware of, most of them are electrical. Last week though it started making a weird loud engine noise that I can't pin down.
Attached is a video, can someone give me a rough estimate of what they think broke? It started making the noise after starting it up from a parked position, not even on the road.
I hope it's not a split camshaft.
The noise comes and goes unrelated to the rpm, so I was suspecting a broken camshaft that jumps in and out of a smooth rotation.

It is a 2005 Mazda3 with close to 200k miles and I only need it to run for 3 more months."

Am I Getting Screwed by Pep Boys?
I was driving my car (2013 Kia Optima Hybrid) on the interstate when all of a sudden it got very humid and a red thermostat light turned on on my dashboard. I pulled over and turned off the car, realizing my engine had overheated and the coolant container was bone dry. Thankfully, there was no smoke and didn’t seem to have caused any permanent engine damage. I had it towed to a Pep Boys to be safe. They called me with an estimate of $1100 worth of repair work and broke it down like this: 

$410: the cost to replace both of the hoses that connect to the water. One of the hoses is leaking which is what caused the engine to overheat in the first place. They said it’s best practice to replace both since if one is failing the other fails shortly after.  

$690: the cost to replace my car’s thermostat. They said there’s a spring in the thermostat that opens and closes to regulate the temperature of the engine, and when it gets overheated past its normal amount, it can get stuck, which can cause the engine to overheat all over again putting us back to square one. They said this is technically recommended not required, but in their experience it usually ends worse if you don’t replace it. 

I researched the thermostat thing, and found many articles that say you should definitely replace this once an engine overheats, and don’t drive your car before replacing it. However, it quotes the price to replace as being $170-$500, so I’m not sure if they’re overcharging me. 

Does anyone with mechanical experience know if I should just pay their $690 and have it done or if it’s worth going through the process of towing it elsewhere and finding a better price (if there even is one)? I’d really appreciate some guidance as I know very little about cars, and I’m also a woman in her 20s that’s never had her car break down so I feel like I’d be more likely to get taken advantage of in a situation like this. Not sure if the fact that my car is a hybrid also makes things pricier. 

Thank you!!"

Can garage charge me twice?
Hi there looking for a bit of advice. My car broke down. Recovery mechanic said slave cylinder was broken. Towed to garage. Garage phoned me to say needed full clutch. I replied and said fine if it’s needed do it. The next day they phoned said they’d fixed it, just the slave cylinder. Next day car won’t go in to gear. Garage says it needs full clutch. Can they try to charge me full price again for installing new clutch even though I’ve already paid to get slave cylinder changed.

Polo - worth repairing?
Advice on old Polo needed!

VW Polo advice please!

I have a 2006 VW Polo. It has broken down twice in the last year. 

First problem was EPC light and it went into limp mode. Then the oil light came on but it had been recently changed. Got it to the mechanic.
Mechanic plugged it in and it said that some sensor needed to be replaced (can't remember which one). He did, it drove grand on the road then next day it was back to the same problem.
Plugged into the diagnostics again and what came up was the throttle body housing. He thought the problem was really with the central computer so he cleaned the wires and it ran again fine, for about 5 months.

Broke down again, same error lights, limp mode. I hoped the same fix could be done but it's not working. Mechanic says there's no point replacing the computer on such an old car, that a new computer is too expensive and a second hand one would have to be programmed to this car and might not work. He doesn't do this work anyway. 

Does anyone have any advice? Should I tow it to a VW garage? Call around garages and ask opinions? 

If I could get a new or second hand computer to bring it back to life, I would. I bought it for €2.5k a year ago. I don't have money for another car, but would put another grand into this if it would run for a couple more years. I would hate to scrap it. 

Your guidance is appreciated!"

Is it worth it to purchase a new transmission to see if that fixes my car.
Let me preface by saying I can't afford a mechanic so please don't suggest that./I apologize if this is a long story.

I have a a 2003 Jeep Grand Cherokee, which broke down a while ago. My boyfriend and his brother are big car guys, especially his brother. Anything they don't know how to do they will figure out. When I got my car it would jerk like there was a problem with the transmission but after putting in transmission fluid, motor oil and doing some basic maintenance it stopped. A few months down the line it started again along with a new problem that when I hit the gas it wouldn't go and would even cause it to slow down. This would only happen sometimes until eventually when I was driving it the check engine light turned on, it started jerking and began to overheat. After letting it cool, adding water and trying to turn it back on it quickly overheated again, wouldn't go anywhere at all and I had to have it towed to a friend's house nearby. 

My boyfriend and his brother looked it over and decided they thought it was the fuel line being gunked up, so they flushed it out. I wound up replacing the fuel pump and all 6 cylinders on it bc all of them were misfiring. This still didn't fix anything and after looking at it again they said they think it's the entire exhaust system, which I don't have the money to fix. However, I have and still do think that it's the transmission and possibly the torque converter as well because not only do these vehicles have the worst possible transmission already but the thing has 200,000 miles on it and was used for hauling up until we got it. They don't seem to think so though.

Because it would cost me the same amount to fix what they think is wrong as it would for me just to buy a new (used) car, my boyfriend wants to take parts off of it, sell them and scrap the rest which I think at the most would get us maybe $300, if that. My thought is that we can go to pull-a-part (for those of you that don't know, it's a used car lot where you can go and pull parts from cars yourself and pay a way discounted price) and purchase a used transmission and torque converter for around $200. Now, this can go one of 3 ways; 1, we purchase the parts put them on and it changes nothing. We can return those part for the same as we paid for them under their 30-day warranty. 2, we put the parts on and the car drives but still overheats due to the exhaust system. Then at the very least it drives and we'd be able to sell it for at least $500/600 (which is what we paid for it). 3, we put them on and it fixes  the car and voila, it works again. 

So let me know, do you think it's worth it? Or should I cut my losses, let him scrap it and get a different car?"

2003 Jeep Liberty
Alright, so I’ve had this issue for a while now. I’ve had a few mechanics look but without enough money they just say it could be a hundred different things. Obviously lol anyway, had a bad rain one day and it got washed down a hill. I turned it off while it was a lot underwater. It worked fine after for a bit  and then one day it refused to start. Now, the engine won’t turn over with the key. I started with the basics. Swapped the battery, the starter, and the alternator. I’ve checked fuses and relays. Everything seems fine there. However, I can pull the starter relay out and put in a piece of wire to bypass the relay and it turns over. Obviously not the brightest idea but oh well. I went and got a new one just in case. Still won’t start. I’m thinking its probably the ignition switch or the actuator pin. Not sure if they’re attached or not. So I guess I’m looking for a second opinion before I start taking it apart again. Also, I need a new grommet for the air intake housing (on the passenger side of the engine if it matters) because it broke pretty much in half, which makes it harder to find the correct one. So if anybody knows which one I need I’d appreciate the help. Thanks in advance for anything to help"

I’m having so much fun. But I don’t give up. I have a Chevrolet 2013 Silverado 1500 ½ ton pickup truck. 
It had 192K Miles on it when I had an AFM lifter 
collapse on Cylinder 4. It is an LC9 motor.
I Rebuilt the top side of the motor with new parts 
including an AFM/DOD delete with Parts from Texas 
Speed Performance. They are great. Good after 
purchase support. I put a Stage 2 CAM in it. This 
VIDEO shows how it was running. I have since 
treated with Marvel Mystery Oil and the lifter noise 
has minimised.
So as everyone knows that when you do a DoD delete you 
supposed to get it tuned so that it doesn’t put your truck 
in “limp mode” when the Valley Pan Actuators are not 
plugged in but some of us are economically challenged 
and still have to get to work. So short of Getting a tune I 
pugged the valley pan back in, suspended nicely and it 
was running Dreamy for 2 months. Lots of power. 
Plugging the valley pan back in trick’s the ECM into 
thinking it can still “actuate” the cylinder deactivation for 
AFM. Stage 2 CAM worked great with out changing the 
torque converter. Block is well grounded. Spraying 
starting fluid into throttle body does not help. This video
shows that on Cylinder 1 there is 150psi of compression 
and spark. The Engine Block seems to have relatively low 
resistance to the negative batter terminal. There doesn’t
seem to be any vacuum leaks.
Installed NEW fuel injectors, ignition coil packs, spark 
plugs and wires. New oil pressure sensor. As I was saying 
it was running sweet for 2 months.
After 45 minutes of HW driving it went into “limp mode.” Reduced Engine power. Crawling along the 
side of the HW.
I unplugged and re-plugged the Valley pan Actuator circuit and the 
truck started right up with regular power like the awesome two 
months prior. I was on the way to a well paying job so I decided to 
keep going forward. 
I had to repeat this procedure 3 times on the way to the job. It 
worked for a period of time between 10-20 minutes each and then 
went back “Engine power Reduced.” It did it several times on the 
way home until when we were 40 miles from home It was shifting up 
and down rapidly and the engine was vibrating abnormally like 
cylinders were misfiring and then when we pulled over I was unable 
to start It. Even though There was plenty of oil pressure Road Side I 
checked the oil and there was none on the dip stick so I assumed I 
had run it out of oil. It didn’t overheat. When AAA got us back to my 
garage It was not seized and had oil it. I change the oil and filter. 
Charged the Battery. Yet I can’t get it to crank. It has 54 psi of 
unleaded fuel pressure and the Throttle position sensor goes over 
50% as is shown in the “Torque” screen shot. Taking the air Breather 
off to show the throttle botty show it opens up when commanded by 
the accelerator petal. Spraying starting fluid in here does nothing to 
help it start.
The Stabili-track warning indicators have been freaking out for a 
while. I’ve been shaking my head at them and waiting for spring warm up to really investigate. I 
assumed it was a wheel baring and I can fix them. So I didn’t think it was much of a problem but a few
You-tube videos said it may have something to do with a throttle position sensor? P0068
A little back ground. I went to VTC for electronics. I’ve worked for Lucent and IBM. I write microcontroller code. I’m a Telecomm guy. I can figure this out. I don’t back down. I will cry uncle. I am just 
so broke right now and in-between contracts and
I am saving up for an HP Tuner but I need to get my truck running. So I’m reaching out to you all for 
advice. 
Trouble Codes
• P0010 – I did a VVT delete when I did the DoD delete. This is the VVT actuator signal connector 
that is dangling and likely corroded from our lovely Vermont winter. But The Motor/Truck has 
been running strong with this code for 2 months.
• P3400 - I believe this code was telling me that the actuators on the valley pan are shitting the 
bed. Open circuit. The ones that haven’t died I measured at about 12ohms. 2 of the 4 have 
failed so far. I plan to substitute some resistors here to trick the motor.
• P0420 – This on was new the day the truck died. 
• P0106 – This one came on about a month ago? –
Replacement MAP on order
• P0101 – MAF - Maybe this my problem – Replacement 
on Order
• P0068 – This one came on the day the truck died. From 
what I’ve been able to tell it has something to do with 
the TPS. I can get it up to 84%. I can hear it actuating 
when I press the accelerator with out starting it. –
Bought Replacement.
• P0452 - This is the Usual code we all ignore when the 
dumb-ass thing breaks. It being broke doesn’t stop the 
engine from running.
• P0420 – I don’t know much about this one. - Emissions
• P3441 - That’s ones on there now. It has to do with 
they valley pan actuator circuit is is opening up.
Parts on order
• Manifold Pressure Sensor
• Mass Air Flow Sensor
• Throttle Position Sensor
• Spark Detector
• Noid Light to Test Injector signal
Could it be a Cam Sensor? A Crank Sensor? There are no codes for those."

Car repair almost cost me my life.
Major Dealership Mechanic Mistake Almost Cost My My Life--HELP!

Please give me advice on my options:

I brought my car into a dealership for a pretty expensive front end and exhaust repair to the tune of $1,000s .  They had the car for about 3 weeks and when I got it back, there was something wrong with the exhaust and about a week later, the front end started making progressively worse noises.

After about 10 days of this total and driving on highways at 75mph, I said I would be bringing the car back that next Monday.

Saturday night late, I was driving home in a blizzard and I ""WAS"" going to take the highway home, but after getting into the onramp lane, I thought I would go through town so I didn't have to deal with the snow at a faster speed.  10 miles from that spot is home.

Less than one mile down the road to home and 2 miles from home, my car broke.

\*\*\*THE TIE ROD FELL OFF!\*\*\*  It fell off because the mechanic never put a bolt on it to keep it on!!  Had I taken that left turn to go onto the highway, I would have wrecked tremendously due to the speed limit of 70mph with a high chance of dying b/c it was the right tie rod, causing the car to shoot left, which would have been into oncoming traffic.

The dealership admitted fault and is correcting the problem, but now I AM AFRAID OF MY OWN CAR and don't want to drive it anymore.  I am scheduled to drive it across the country in less than two weeks and I don't want to do that now.

My question is, what sort of recourse would I have?  Full or partial refund or anything else?

Thank you!"

It was doing this a bit before the spark plug change, but not as bad. Took it to a shop and they put new OEM plugs in and performed a compression test. Engine has compression, engine light is turned off, but the RPM's are still not normal after the new plugs were put in.

93 Dodge Spirit Heater issue
So I have a 93 Dodge Spirit someone gave me last year after my car broke down. It has run pretty decently but ok very the last month I have had some heater issues and the temp Guage swings between C & H. 

First thing I tried was to replace the thermostat. There was a 170° one in it originally. All I could get at the time was a 196° one so I put that in. Still no heat.   My mechanic found a hole in the radiator and we replaced that. I had heat for the trip home but now no heat again. My engine coolant isn't leaking I have checked it daily since the radiator replacement to make sure there isn't a further leak. Today I replaced the thermostat again, this time with a 180° thermostat and the temp gauge swing isn't as bad and I could feel a little heat, it was still a freezing 30min car ride home.

Any ideas what to look at. That cat is running well except this issue and I kind of need heat right now.  Thanks for your suggestions in advance!!!"

Did I buy a Lemon, or am I being taken for a ride?
TLDR:Bought a car in Late March/Early April, car broke down on Aug 23rd and has been in the shop since with new problems cropping up with each repair, while I sit here with no car, or loaner, and it's supposed to be covered by insurance/warranty.

Full Details:

Around Late March/Early April 2021 I purchased a 2019 Toyota Corolla from The Enterprise Dealership in Worcester MA. It has 31k miles on it, and I had spent a little extra for the warranties/insurance to catch the problems that might pop up, along with regular tire replacement coverage.

On August 24th, while after eating at a local diner, the car refused to start. Luckily the parking lot belong to a Super Market chain, and there was an Advanced Auto Parts and Speedee Auto Repair near by. Hearing the commotion my car, myself, and my roommate were making brought the attention of both stores. A worker from, along with a few onlookers came out to look at my car and deduced it was the fuel pump, since Toyota had recently had a recall on fuel pumps. They figured this out by unhooking a few hoses, and pumping starter fluid into the engine to see if it would start.

Armed with this knowledge, I called up my insurance/warranty holder and got my car towed to the nearest authorized repair shop, the Toyota Dealership of Keene NH. Because it was over 20miles, I had to talk the company into covering the rest of the distance due to the circumstance.

We sat in the parking lot for 4hrs, waiting for the tow. The guy came, took the car and dropped us off within a block of our house.. where we've been more or less stuck ever since.

It wasn't until Thursday the 26th that I got a full confirmation that the Toyota Dealership of Keene NH had received my car. I had called Wednesday, but the answer didn't feel like a true confirmation.

On Monday Aug 30th, I called the dealership again to find out if there was any update on my car. The technician assigned to my vehicle told me that the Fuel Pump HAD been replaced, but the issue was the Electric Starter. The starter for my car was an OEM part they would have to special order. I had to have the technician call my insurance/warranty people so that I could get a rental/loaner car covered from enterprise.

I called up the insurance, and told them what's going on. Because the technician said the repair would only take a few hours, they would only give me 1 day of rental covered. At this point I had already been without a car for almost a week. So I called the dealership back, and had him tell the insurance that the part needed to be ordered. Because of this they offered me 3 days of rental covered.

Enterprise of Gardner, MA IMMEDIATELY called me to say they have my reservation, but there are no cars available. To matters even worse, according to the worker I was speaking to, because of covid and the current weather crisis, all cars are round trip only. You cannot drop your car off at another location, but must return it to the store you rented it from.

The following Friday, Sept 3rd, I called the Toyota Dealership again. They informed me they had gotten the wrong part, and would need to reorder the part for the car. On Monday the 6th, I called again for any news about the car and the part, only to be told they'd call me back.. which never happened.

On Tuesday Sept 7th, Enterprise of Gardner MA finally have a vehicle I could rent as my loaner. I was able to keep it through Friday, covered by my insurance. This was all the time they would covered...

Friday the 10th, I called the Toyota Dealership first thing in the morning. They had gotten the part and were beginning to work on it. They said they'd call me back when they were ready. At 2:14pm the dealership calls me back to tell me they fixed the part, but the whole car shorted out afterward and now refuses to start. They have to call in a specialist to look at my car and figure out what is going on.. they even asked if my car had been hit by lightning,.. which no, I don't think it has. It was outside during the hurricane Henry, but that's about it. Because we thought we'd be picking up the vehicle Saturday, we had kept the rental car till Sunday, just in case.

Which brings us to today, September 13th, 2021. I called the Toyota Dealership around 2pm EST. I spoke to the receptionist/secretary and she tried to transfer me to the technician working on my car. He was busy talking to people so she just passed on a message from him to me. The message was they are now waiting on 3 electrical components to fix my car. However due to the chip shortage, these components are in short supply and in high demand.  The woman said they would be in touch,  but If you don't hear from us again, feel free to call us back for another update on your car's status.

Stressed out, I began to look into the Massachusetts Lemon law to see if this falls under it [https://www.mass.gov/topics/lemon-laws](https://www.mass.gov/topics/lemon-laws)

I then called the Enterprise Dealership in Worcester MA, the place I bought the car. I explained the situation, and was transferred to the manager. The manager and I spoke, and he doesn't know if this qualifies as Lemon Law yet, because it's been over 3months but not yet been 3 full repairs. However he felt something is going on with Toyota and that I should call THEIR GM and get answer from them since they are being vague about what needs to be repaired.

I then called my insurance, they have NOT been update on my car's status and because of this I cannot get another loaner car. Meaning I have to once again have the Dealership/Technician call and report the information to the insurance so that I may once again have a vehicle to use.

I've not called the Toyota GM yet.

So what do you think?

Did I get a lemon? Did I get screwed over?I'm at wit's end and just trying to figure out what to do.

Should I contact a lawyer?

Thank you for your time.

EDIT 9/14/2021 - The car has been fixed!

When I got up, I called up my warranty, and explained my situation to them. One of their managers called me back an hour or so later, and they begrudgingly gave me one more day, and a subsidized rate if I needed to keep it longer.

While on the ride to pick up the rental/loaner car, the dealer finally called me back.

Everything has been fixed, and the car is working perfectly. It was something aftermarket that Enterprise had done to the car that was caused it to short out. It sounded like some sort of security, tracking device but don't quote me.

By replacing the parts affected, and getting a new OEM Toyota Keyfob (Enterprise gave us an after market one at purchase and I didn't even realize) the car is now working like a dream."

Fixing my Opel Astra
Hi all, first post here, but hoping for some advise :)  
I am deeply in love with my 2001 Opel Astra diesel car, yet sadly she broke down last week, water in the oil and apparently some damage to the engine. My mechanic tells me it is not worth fixing the car anymore, seen her age. I am contemplating bringing her home and teaching myself (with help from experienced family members) how to replace the engine.  I have the time and some budget, yet would have to buy all the tools and will have to work from my underground garage.

Does this sound foolish, or do you recon with time and effort, it is something a novice can learn?

Thanks a lot!"

Fix or Sell?
Car pals, I have a 2011 Corolla with about 175,000 miles on it. I used it for Lyft for a couple years and got it used in 2015. 

The car broke down and I think that the transmission is the problem. Mechanics are quoting between 1,500-3,000 to fix it (one quotes 1,800 and that seems fair). But the car has had other problems over the past year and I worry things will keep breaking even if I fix it now.

Do you think I should fix it, or sell it and try to find a new car (maybe a lease)."

Questionable mechanic
I drive a 1994 Nissan 21 xe V6. 3 weeks ago it broke down on me while driving. It felt like it was running out of gas then just cut out. When I went to start it it sounded like a loos whine and I thought it might be the fly wheel. I had it toed to a mechanic right by my house who have never used before, and they are Hispanic and the mechanics don't speak English so I'm talking to them through the person running the desk. They checked it out and said they'd have to fix the timing belt to see if anything else was wrong and that would cost about 550. I thought that was high but I decided sure go for it. 
It turns out that the engine is bad (I did see the original timing belt all stripped and ruined) so they found me an engine with 130000 miles for 1200 and would put it in for 850 including the initial work they did. I decided I'm in this far I might as well just do it. It's been 3 weeks now and almost 2 since they got the engine in and I'm starting to worry something might be pretty fishy going on. I'm going to go in tomorrow and see what's up, I've asked a few times and they keep saying they will have it done early in the week for the last 2 weeks in a row. Does all that sound weird to anyone else?"

not sure if this belongs here, but can i still get my car fixed if i switch insurance?
hey all,

i was the victim of a parked hit and run accident outside of my apartment complex in November 2018. i had Allstate as my insurance company but due to my recent move, i am too broke to pay them $200 per month. when the accident happened, i was told to go to an auto body shop where they would assess the damage; which they did. $4k worth in damages but my deductible was $725. i never had that money to spend on my car so the side of my sedan has remained fucked up to this day. 

i switched to root insurance about a week ago and i wondered if it would still be possible to get my car fixed later on down the road if i still have the quote from the auto body shop? any and all advice is very welcome since i want my car fixed but refuse to pay the full $4k for it. TIA!"

Chevy Imapala 2013 Ltz Key won’t release, windows not working
Basically I was driving him and noticed my windows don’t work, any of them, so I was whatever and drove home parked and tried to turn off the car, but the key won’t go to the off position and it won’t let me pull it out of the ignition. I’ve already checked to make sure the shifter wasn’t having issues to see if I wasn’t fully in park, this wasn’t the case. I also checked to see if maybe the battery was bad, this also wasn’t the case. I was able to manually eject the key by taking off the underpart of the steering wheel and turn off the car. The windows won’t power and I can’t get my key out of the ignition. Both of these problems appeared at the same time.

P2172-30 code after EGR replacement - 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan
TLDR: I think I messed up my EGR replacement but didn't know how.

My 2010 Dodge Grand Caravan was showing several P0404 codes for EGR issues. I replaced it. However, as I was reassembling, I noted a gap between the pipe coming from the top of the engine and the engine (photo). On starting, the air leak was very noticeable. For the life of me, I don't know why it how that gap is there. I don't remember anything else being there. I've VERY temporarily filled that gap with several rubber washers. The van seems to run fine but after clearing codes, the P2172-30 code has returned. In what way am I an idiot? "

Vsa light after rear wheel bearing/hubs replaced 2008 acura rl
2008 Acura RL
Paid an Acura dealership to replace both rear wheel bearings with provided timken wheel bearings. Afterwards I now have the triangular warning ⚠️ Light and then shortly after the VSA light comes on.

The service manager said today the rear speed sensors are not communicating with the bearings, and that the battery may have low voltage causing this. I brought a new battery and installed it and the warning light and VSA still display.

The service manager it may be the bearings I had installed causing this. Its hard to believe both timken bearings are bad, their trying to sell me OEM bearings from them and want to charge me to reinstall.

I may take it somewhere else for a second opinion first, its very hard to believe both rear bearings and hubs have defective tone rings.. what else could be causing this issue. Thank you."

Transmission Code P0720
Hi! I own a 2005 Nissan Armada SE Off-Road Edition (4WD) and I'm getting the code mentioned in the title, P0720 Output Speed Sensor (aka Revolution Sensor)

I'm wondering how difficult it would be to DIY the repair, because I'm working a job that doesn't even pay a liveable wage and living with my parents. I've already DIY'd plenty of other things, and can YouTube University my way through other things.

I know that the real answer is ""go to a shop"", but that isn't even remotely in the budget for me. I also occasionally get a P1822 Duty Solenoid code on my 4WD system, as well as a few other codes, but they aren't consistent. This makes me think it could be a communication and/or grounding issue, since in the past I'd get a U1000 Network CEL code.

Any and all advice, assistance, and help would be greatly appreciated!"

Issue with passenger side tire.
So last week my wife veered off the road slightly and the passenger side tire went off road, it was about a 6"" drop. She cant recall if when she corrected she hit a 6"" elevation (I assume yes). Anyway, the car makes a grinding noise that hurts my soul to hear. I went to the shop at my friend's dealership to lift it and see whats up. Included are pictures of the passenger side tire and the issue, the driver side for reference.

The issue is circled in red, that arm is making contact with the rim and grinding big time.

Does anyone have an idea on how much this would be to fix?"

Small leak power steering pressure repaired?
Hi, 
I bought a used Dodge Grand caravan 2010 3,5 months ago and drove 5000km with it during that time. In the summer I want to go on roadtrips (starting in 2,5 weeks). So I went to a mechanic to get an inspection and he said there were small leaks on the power steering pressure line and from the lower oil pan and valve covers. He did not say that the issue was urgent and that all fluids are still fine (I never changed them during the 3,5 months I had the car.). He told me getting these things done would be 600-700 dollars.
The problem is, after the roadtrips I will fly back to my home country and sell the car. Do you think it is worth it getting these things repaired or should I just leave it and hope it doesn't get worse?

Walmart Car Center Issue


Having an issue and wanted to see if anyone else has ever experienced this. 

I have a 2014 Mazda 3 i Sport. 

I brought my car to Walmart Car Center yesterday to get two new tires in the back and have them rotated, dropped off at 2 got a call an hr later that it was done and ready to pick up. Came to pick it up at 6pm after work, looked at my car and noticed they didn’t rotate the tires, came back in and told them I paid for the service expecting a refund since it was close to closing time (7pm). I was told they would get it done right away and that it shouldn’t take long. 

Around 7:15 I checked in on them since it was after hours at this point, they told me they were having difficulty torquing the car bc they couldn’t get the tires back on.  

I do have off the market rims (this is how I received the car when I bought it used), I can understand how that can be difficult. I was told that my lug nuts were too short and small, they couldn’t tighten it properly. 

But I’m also really confused bc I’ve had my car for 8 years and haven’t had this issue at other Walmarts or Auto shops. Only had this issue with roadside services/Triple A once. 

They kept trying until 8:15, at this point I felt so bad having them work so late. I told them I could come back tomorrow so that they could figure it out. They then recommended that I get new lug nuts and a lug nut lock key for all 4 tires from Autozone the next day for them. 

Does this sound normal? Is it that this Walmart location just does not have the correct size/tool to tighten my lug nuts?

Blower Motor Issue
Hello all,

My 2019 Chevy Trax has been having issues with the blower motor.
In 2023, at Repair Shop A, the blower motor, resistor, pigtail, and cabin air filter were replaced.

In April 2025, I took the car to Repair Shop B due to settings 1&2 being the same blow speed and 3&4 being the same blow speed. At that time, all paperwork of past repairs (including the 2023 occurrence at Repair Shop A) were taken in and Repair Shop B copied them and saved them. The paperwork they gave me post-repair clearly states “No damage to the resistor.”

Now, in June of 2025, the fan stopped working altogether. I took the car back to Repair Shop B stating so and they called saying the blower motor, resistor, pigtail, and cabin air filter needed to be replaced.

I am just a girl so I authorized the repair but my dad found out and says I need to go to Repair Shop B and say that this is strange that the resistor suddenly needs to be replaced. That they had the history and the paperwork and they should have seen the pattern and diagnosed this better.

Does that sound appropriate to say to them? I am super worried since i already authorized the repair. They said the parts won’t have came in until tomorrow so they won’t have fixed any part of the car anyways. Any advice on what to say to Repair Shop B? Photos included of the paperwork."

Bluedriver OBD2 scan tool requires now to open account if not they will brick it
This is my latest updated review \[origanl one is below\] off Blue Driver OBD2 scan tool. I bought thi item in 2016. Its worked VERY good until they decided to update their software lately. Please rad below. BUYER BEWARE



05/24/25. They updated to version 8 a few days back which now asks for you to open a “free” account with them. This is just another ploy for an overpriced gadget ($89 today) to be able to data mine and sell to brokers and insurance companies who are paying big bucks to garner this information. To ad insult to injury they want your email to send a confirmation code. The email never arrived for 3 days and when it did it came after 1 hour of requesting the code. Problem Is you have to use it within 10 mins of them sending it to you. I plugged in the number less than 30 secs after getting the code it said it had been more than 10 Mins! This item has not been able to be used because of a flawed deployment of version 8. If you go To the Apple Store and look at their ratings you will see that people are complaining about this issue already. They claim the will not use your data. Yeah right! Even if you used a fake name and disposable email your VIN numbers are saved. They can be easily tied to You since now a days cars record EVEYTHING you do in your car (speed, how many miles/hours you drive a day, location etc). They should have an opt out to This data mining.  
  
I really hope they get a lawyer to destroy them  
In a lawsuit.  
  
I’m going ti write and see if they will reimburse me. Plenty of other devices similar to This one that cost 1/3 of price and don’t data mine. Years have passed and reading other reviews while this and other readers are not perfect, they give you the info you need for 75% less than blue driver without asking you to register or render the item you paid for useless.  
  
Revised 2016 I bought this \[with my own money not a free on for a review\] hoping I would not have to use my very expensive hand held ones anymore which are cumbersome and you always pretty much have to go to the computer to get the codes and search on the net to see what they mean, possible causes and possible fixes.  
  
I bought one on amazon similar to this one that was around $18 and had to buy a couple of apps for my phone \[around 10 dollars for the apps\] to be able to use it. It was OK but I wanted MORE information. I read amazon reviews and realized this was the Cadillac of them at this time \[Jan 2016\]. I got it in 2 days with Prime. I plugged it on my 3 vehicles and it gives us a plethora of information. We have since sold our hand held ones on craigslist since this thing works so good and gives you unbelievable amount of information. \[I do have a couple of complaints, later in the review.\]  
  
I have been looking for another used vehicle and this device has saved us thousands $$. Your phone is connected to the internet so it goes out and gets you a lot of extra info right away & also updates the device software if need be. It even gives you information about when was the last time someone ERASED ERROR CODES which is happening across the dealers & private sellers in the 40207 and 33186 zip codes more than you would have thought! \[in DAYS:HRS:MINS and also miles\]. Don't forget anyone can get a cheap code reader for less than 20 dollars and erase all codes!  
  
The serious codes that the vehicle computer reads will come back immediately if erased, others will take a day or 2 -or longer-of driving time to come back in. To late if you bought a vehicle from a private owner and it's in your name already. Its funny to see the face of people when I tell them, these are all the error codes that the vehicle is giving me, the possible causes \[yes this thing does tell you that too!\] and BTW someone erased the codes 3 days 22 hrs and 3 minutes ago! It will give you all recalls for the make and model has had from day one! You can ask the owner or dealer to make sure those have been addressed or not.  
  
Most will claim \[dealers and private owners\] that no one has erased the error codes. I say to them ""well sir or madam, this is what YOUR vehicle computer is telling my device. It pretty much saying that someone came in here with a key and a code reader, plugged it in and erased the codes 3 days 22 hrs and 3 minutes ago!""  
  
When they finally fess up \[not all of them do\] I just ask them what were the codes that were erased \[to see if it was something easy like they didn't close the fuel cap correctly or something serious like -which I got on several different vehicles without any lights on the dash-a catalytic converter, an O2 sensor or both, anti lock brake codes, steering angle sensors, low or high voltage power supply, tire pressure warning system codes, airbag malfunctions, etc\].  
  
This purchase has saved thousands on repairs on several vehicles I checked and would have bought!. Sellers were asking top dollar for these vehicles because they had “no lights on the dash” and they had done a cleaning detail on the vehicle!  
  
I even took a vehicle that I really liked to a dealership and paid for an inspection. They didn't get what I got on the code reader at first \[or just didn't plug their code reader\] but when I complained to the service manager, they hooked up their reader and got the same stuff \[erased codes\] and other malfunction codes that were not showing on the dash. BTW this device only tells you that codes were erased, it does not tell ou which ones. They refunded my inspection money because of their embarrassment. That right there paid for this device!  
  
I also have run in a couple of situations where the person selling the vehicle has advertised a higher model of the vehicle I was looking at to get more money out of it. These are vehicles in the 7k to 15k range I've been looking at \[clean title only\]. This has happened with private sellers who either buy the LXE \[as an example\] letters from ebay or a junk yard \[I am guessing\] and put the new letters claiming the vehicle is a higher level that it really is. The software on this device reads the vin number goes to the net and gets the EXACT model and make from the vehicle. You should see the face of people when I tell them this is a L model \[the lower end one \] and not the LEX one! Some of you would say this is on the tittle, well…. Not always. I have a Honda Odyssey and the title does NOT say which model it is!  
  
I think everyone reading this knows there are lots of people who are buying vehicles at auction, cleaning them up and sell them for profit posing as regular owners. A vehicle fax can be $40/vehicle and gets expensive quick if you do several cars. \[I like vehicle carfax over other because they give you a lot more information on regular service etc than their competitors\].  
  
In my area code and in the MIAMI area -which is were I have been also trying to buy a used vehicle- there are tons of people selling more than 10 vehicles a year \[which are required by law to get a dealer license and do not\]. When you ask them why is the vehicle not on their name, or why the have 4 vehicles for sale out of their house, or why was the title on the vehicles he/she's selling less than 3 weeks old the come with the story about them getting a better vehicle or sob storries. If you pry hard enough they'll tell you they are ""wholesalers"" but don't have the required licenses insurance etc and are less than reputable in the disclosure of their vehicles they're selling. Don't get me started on the habitual “private” sellers of salvage but repaired title vehicles!  
  
Use this device wisely and save yourself a lot of headaches or negotiate a better price on the used vehicle you are buying and also check your existing vehicles and telling your mechanic exactly what is going on. Be an informed consumer.  
  
I have two complaints about the device:  
  
1- When looking this couple of months for a used vehicle in zip code areas 40207 and 33186, I usually start the vehicle with it plugged in, let it read all the codes, vin number etc, while the vehicle is warming up, then I drive the vehicle for about 15 to 20 mins to get more info on what the vehicle is doing while you drive it etc and hope that one of the erased codes pops up again. I have lost connection with my phone and the device several times while driving, where I have to stop and reconnect it and therefore lost all data that was being recorded. I thought it could be my phone connection via the Blue-tooth, so I downloaded the app on my wifes phone and the same thing happens! They are both newer iphone 6 and 6 +. Sellers are not to happy to go around and drive the vehicle again for 20 mins so I can record results again!  
  
2-I have also had the device fall from the ODBII plug several times. This kind of sucks because you have to start the process all over again and lose all the data that was there before. I have checked about 20 vehicles in the last 3 months. I usually email myself the data while the app is running and they show the results from that email to the seller if there is something wrong since I haven't figured out how to save the data in the phone. I have resorted now to getting some blue tape and taping it around the plug and the device when its plugged in. Not something I'm happy about. Hope this helps some of you out there."

Need help with a deep down coolant line replacement.
Hey everyone, I have a Chrysler 200 I’m currently trying to repair. so recently my coolant line has been showing its age and periodically disconnecting from the top quick connection point. 

I got a replacement from the loose connector and it’s been fine up on til a few days back when cleaning the engine cover with a degreaser I wanted to check to see if the connection was loosening again. I went to just move both ends towards one another and apparently it was dry rotted and snapped outside of the connection end. I ordered a replacement part for it and now I’m trying to take the old one off and put the new one in. However I ran into a big issue. My hands are too big to fit down there and disconnect the hose. I disconnected as many connections as I could see to clear the space so I can get down there. I also got a long pry bar to reach although I can’t see the Connecter tab on looking down on it. 

I need a bit of advice. Anyone out there delt with this stuff before? Do I have a shot getting something added to the top to tie that hose back and get it to a shop? Currently it’s a heatwave and a nearby shop still has me going around 7-12 miles without coolant.

For the tl;dr my coolant line snapped off and I got a new part to replace it, but I got big hands. I need help.

2014 Toyota Camry- Oil
Monday started doing ubereats delivery. Before I started I got an oil change, tune up. No issue with leaks or seals. 

My car will lose 1 to 2 quarts of oil, between oil changes. 

Friday I checked oil and it was just below the bottom dot on the stick. I added 2 quarts and it moved up to the top dot. I wonder why, with no smoke, no leaks. how my car is burning that much oil

Sometime last year I did have a valve cover seal replace.

Rodent Damage or Shady Dealer?
2024 Kia Telluride

I brought my can to the dealership originally in February 2025 due to a lane assist warning an inability to activate cruise control. Over 5 visits, I was given multiple diagnosed issues: bad ECS module(replaced and didn’t fix), bad cruise control module, bad pin tensioner, and bad wiring harness. The most recent visit, my car has been with the dealership since April (it’s still there). There were weeks long periods of inactivity, as indicated by the Kia connect app not alerting to any door opening or unlocked doors. On 6/4 the dealership determined they needed to replace the wiring harness and I initiated a lemon law case with Kia on 6/11. There were many lies during this whole process about work being done and when things would be completed. It wasn’t until I sent an email to the owner that any real movement occurred.

Kia finally contacted the dealership on 6/26 and the dealership indicated the car would be completed yesterday, 6/27. Suddenly, I get a call from the dealership on 6/26 evening which I return the next morning. They tell me they determined this is no longer a warranty issue and nice actually ate the harness and they couldn’t move forward. Convenient because the car was supposed to be completed not only on 6/27, but they had also indicate it would be done the two previous weeks but kept giving excuses. 

They did, however, supply the above image. What seems most likely to me is that the mice entered the vehicle during the 5 weeks or so it sat in their lot not moving and that the issue existed prior. The image actually looks to me like the damage was cause attempting to pull the harness through the grommet - specifically, the grommet is clearly damaged AND the damage on the wires is in straight lines, perpendicular, and across the wires. It kind of looks to me like what would happen if a pliers was used to attempt to pull the harness through. 

Curious on everyone’s thoughts. It seem suspicious that there was never a single mention of rodent signs before this point, they diagnoses the issue as multiple other problems, they had supposedly already disassembled and reassembled the dashboard at least one previous time, and it was only after I filed a lemon law notice with Kia and the dealership was contacted about it that suddenly it was rodent damage when the vehicle was clearly at the point of missing another deadline.

Should I trust this Dealer?

LOCATION: Wisconsin, United States

I bought a new 2024 Kia Telluride from a dealership in May 2024. In February 2025, the vehicle started throwing a lane change assist warning upon startup and attempting to activate the cruise control would throw additional warning and the cruise control could not activate.

I brought the car to the dealership on 2/24/2025 and  was told it needed a replacement ECS module. On 3/12 the dealer replaced the ECS module and opened a case with their tech line when the replacement part failed to resolve the issue. I picked the car up on 3/14 to use for the weekend.

I returned the vehicle the next week and it stayed with them from 3/18 thru 3/21 when I again picked it up to use for the weekend.  I was told they would call when tech line responded. 

On 3/27 the dealer reached out to bring the vehicle back as they had received a response from tech line. I brought the car in again from 4/1 thru 4/4. I was told I could again pick it up for the weekend because they had done everything tech line asked but could not figure out the issue. They indicated they would reach out when I should bring the vehicle back. One thing to note - I have a repair order from this visit that contains a fabrication that the issue could not be replicated though the warning was on when I brought it in, on when I picked it up, and I was in communication with the service advisor that they were actively trying to diagnose the problem.

On 4/14, I reached out to Kia Customer Care as I had not heard back from the dealership and was tired of feeling like I was being given the runaround. Kia Customer Care offered a number of non-solutions. First, they told me that the dealer told them that they could not replicate the issue. I provided evidence that they knew there was an issue and they then blamed me for having picked up the vehicle, stating that I didn’t “give them the time needed to diagnose the issue and make the needed repairs” but that there was still an open case with tech line. When I responded that I was doing what the dealership told me to do, they sent me a link where I could purchase the Kia repair manuals. Obviously not helpful. 

I got back in touch with the dealership and again brought my vehicle in on 4/28 determined to give them enough time to diagnose the issue. On 5/1, I was told that they were taking apart the dashboard and that the issue was either the pin tensioner or the cruise control module. On 5/6 I was told they were still checking on some of the wiring. For the next 4 weeks or so, I don’t believe anything was done with my vehicle. I finally caved and went to pickup a loaner vehicle on 5/9 where my car was sitting in the lot outside of the service center. For the next 4 weeks, I am fairly certain nothing was done with my vehicle. I received no alerts that the doors had been opened or left unlocked (which I get from the app).

On 6/3, having received no updates, I sent an email directly to the owner of the dealership. I did not receive a response, but magically I started getting communication from the service manager directly. They immediately determined that I would need a new dash harness for the vehicle and ordered it on 6/4. 

On 6/10 the part arrived and I was told they would begin installing it. 

On 6/11, I filed another complaint with Kia about a potential lemon law case. This was escalated to their escalations department nearly immediately, and I followed up by supplying them with copies of the repair orders and the Wisconsin Lemon Law form. 

On 6/13 I was told by the dealership that they were still working on it through the weekend. On 6/17 I was told that no additional progress was made but the plan was to have it completed by the end of the week. On Friday 6/20 I was told that there were unexpected circumstances and it would not be completed. On 6/24 I was told it would be completed by Wednesday or Thursday for return on Friday.

On Thursday evening I received a response from the Kia escalations team that they had contacted the dealership and the dealer would have my vehicle completed by today, 6/27. However, I received a call from the service manager who suddenly stated that they found evidence that this was all actually cause by mice, it would no longer be a warranty repair, and that I would need to make an insurance claim.

I am looking for advice because this is all incredibly suspect to me. I used my vehicle every day, making it fairly unlikely that rodents would take residence. It seems more likely to me that this would have occurred after the fact when the vehicle sat on their lot for weeks and weeks without being used. Additionally, prior to the prospect of a lemon law claim being brought to the dealership, there had not been a single mention of any signs rodent activity, which includes when they supposedly removed the entire dash to check the wiring. This just seems like an all too convenient out for a situation that has been going on for pretty much 4 months.  

Am I just being paranoid, or does something seem off? More importantly, is there anything I can do about it?  I was well past the point of a valid lemon law claim in Wisconsin (30 days in the shop for the same issue) so if the rodent damage occurred on their lot, which seems most likely to me, I would think I am still entitled to a lemon law claim. At this point I want nothing to do with the dealer, with Kia, and with this vehicle.

2014 Kia Rio Ignition Issue
Hello,

My key keeps getting stuck in the ignition of my 2014 Kia rio, it does not always get stuck but it does a lot of the time. For background, a couple of years ago my car was broken into and the person basically destroyed my ignition trying to steal my car. My car was fixed at a mechanics and they replaced the ignition and everything but I’ve been having this issue since. I had the inhibition replaced again recently and I’m STILL having this issue. The most recent person who replaced my ignition stated that it may be some electrical issue, because he disconnected my battery and reconnected it and the key came out. I do have an appointment with an auto electrician in a couple of weeks but does anyone have any advice on how to get my key out of the ignition? It’s stuck in the pictured position. I’ve tried turning it on and off again, putting it in drive then park about 20 times, it’s still not coming out. I’m thinking I might need to disconnect the battery.

Thanks in advance!"

Scratched and dented my car door. Should I get it fixed?
I have a pre owned Nissan Rogue. I accidentally scratched and dented my front passenger door against a brick wall while parking. The door was functional and there were no issues opening or closing the door. Just cosmetic damage. 
Honestly, I'm not sure if I'm bothered by its looks, only feel guilty about doing it. I just need it to drive from point A to point B.
Do I really need to get it fixed? I feel the prices for car repair are pretty high in USA and I'm not sure if it's worth it.

Major caster difference
Hi everyone,
I own a 1991 Mazda MX-5 (NA) and recently did some work on the front suspension:
	•	Replaced the outer tie rod ends
	•	Installed new coilovers
	•	Changed a front wheel bearing

I went to get an alignment afterwards, but the shop told me there’s a big difference in caster angle between the left and right front wheels. Their message said the issue is likely with the subframe, control arms or steering knuckle, and that they’d need to disassemble the front suspension and measure everything to pinpoint the fault.

Has anyone experienced this before on an NA Miata?
What’s the most likely cause here?
I don’t think the car has been in a crash.

Would really appreciate any tips before I start replacing parts blindly. Thanks!"

Toyota Aygo 2010 indicators only work when held down….

Other issues with the car include: Heater working but aircon doesn’t blow out cold air, more like a fan. I also think there’s an issue with the radio with it not fully reacting when I press the volume buttons. I think I may have fixed this however with the fuse being replaced. 

I’ve tried to replace the fuses for the relevant issues with the car for the air-con and indicator related issues but that did not turn out successful. 

The answer for the indicator fix will most likely be to replace the stalk but I’ve watched YouTube videos and I just don’t rly feel confident to attempt it myself based off what I saw. But the car is a piece of junk and probably not even worth the cost of replacing the stalk. So I’m looking for possible other options to try that people may know. Even if it’s just a temporary fix. 

Thanks!

2006 Scion XA code P0103 and P0456
Hello. I had a problem last 6/18/25. It was raining bad and I had no choice but to drive througha puddle. I was able to drive the car into a parking and it stopped working. The car starts and dies immediately. It gave me the code P0103 because I had a scanner with me. As a woman, not knowing anything about cars. I had it towed to a mechanic that I usually go to. Take note: The first owner of the car had it modified, a friend of mine said that the car does not have the original airbox so it is exposed.

They looked at it and called me to say they fixed it. I picked it up 6/20. I asked them what the issue was and mechanic told me that the water did not get to the engine (so I thought whew that's a good thing) they said that they used a product to clean the MAF sensor. They charged me $300 for it.

The car was driving fine after I picked it up. Now 6/26/25, I started the car and it had check engine lights on and I used my scanner and it is giving me P0103 again and now added: P0456. I don't know but I've been reading about the codes. I don't want to accuse mechanic but I wanted to ask for an opinion from all of you. What should I do?? What could be the problem? 

I called the mechanic and said that the code came back with another code which was the evap leak and I was told to take the car back so they can look at it and I might need a new maf sensor. Have it towed to the shop 

They should've addressed it properly the first time right? Paying for labor that high is a problem for me because I'm not rich. I don't know what would happen next.


Please give me an idea on how to work it out, what do I say to the mechanic or whatever that can help me. Since the car is starting, I might try to drive it to the mechanic."

Is my micro-v belt the same as an ac belt?
Hello! Sorry if this is confusing…

I had my ac repaired in my ford transit connect a few months ago and it was running fine for a while. This mechanic (mechanic #1) replaced the “micro v-belt” along with a lot of other ac parts. 

A couple months later, we brought the van in to our dealer because of some major engine issues it was having and noticed that a broken belt was hanging down from somewhere around the engine. This mechanic (mechanic #2) made a note of it saying “A/C belt is missing on arrival”.

The cost of fixing the engine issues were adding up so we told mechanic #2 to only fix what was necessary. The ac still doesn’t work so it’s safe to assume they didn’t fix that. Which is fine since that’s basically what we requested. 

Mechanic #1 said any parts he used were under warranty and if we had any issues, we could bring it to another Napa certified mechanic to get it fixed for free. 

My question is: is the belt mechanic #1 replaced (micro-v belt) the same as the belt that mechanic #2 made a note of? If it is, I’m pretty sure it’s under warranty. Yay! If it’s not then idk…

Thank you in advance! Let me know if I can clarify anything."

Backyard mechanic needing help lol
Let me start by saying I’ve only ever worked on my own cars, never had run into an issue I couldn’t fix… until today. So my 2010 equinox (daily driver) was having some issues. My rotor was overheating, steering wheel was shaking pretty bad at 40mph, shaking when breaking/going downhill, etc. Figured my caliper seized up, but my caliper seemed in fine shape and the car wasn’t dragging to one side or having any noticeable faults other than what was listed. 2nd thought was a warped rotor, nope rotor was in tact and completely fine surprisingly considering the overheating. I bit the bullet and took it to my local mechanic who told me my break hose was pinching between the caliper resulting in not enough fluid reaching my breaks causing the overheating, but it was still in tact but they would just replace it for me for $200. Does this seem like a likely issue that would cause these symptoms or anyone thinking they wanted to just have a quick fix to get it out of the shop? I’ve had a break line pinch in my MDX, all it did was cause uneven breaking. But then again I’m no expert, just enjoy fixing my own cars. Any advice or insight would be appreciated. "

Help with oil on piston head
Hi,
I’ve got a 2007 Audi A4 (2.0T) it’s recently had a rocker cover gasket leaking causing oil to leak onto the spark plugs/coils and onto the piston head. Creating a consistent misfire when both idling and accelerating (scanned to show cylinder 4 misfire), I’ve replaced all plugs/coils, and the RCG to fix the oil leak. Car was still misfiring so took it into a shop to get professionally fixed, they replaced a single fuel injector. Say that the car is now running fine with a very occasional misfire, which is likely to be because the engine has been tuned /(stage 1 plus) yet it’s never missed when in the year and a half it has been tuned. 
Once I get the car back it is running near perfect, cabin misfire has completely gone when idling and even accelerating. Warmed the engine up to drive home. Only problem is once I was driving at 80km/h accelerating to 100km/h there was a minor stutter, almost as if the car just hesitated. With the engine light flashing on my dash. Scanned this at home again to show the same fault code (cylinder 4 misfire, after insuring it was cleared). I was driving it later and it drove fine just had the exact same problem under the exact same speed range but with the misfire being so much less pronounced then what it was before the repair. My mechanic does know about this issue as I rung him to explain it. 

My question is, considering the car is nearly perfect to drive as opposed to it driving nearly entirely on 3 cylinders before the shop repair, so I don’t doubt that the fuel injector would have been the main issue.
The mechanic had shown me images off the plug (plug was later cleaned) and the cylinder head which were both covered in oil/carbon, is this misfire at this stage something entirely different or would it likely be the plug burning off the remaining oil/carbon on the cylinder head and likely fix itself in the near future?

Thanks for any help

2004 Cadillac DeVille - Repair Advice Desperately Needed
I originally posted this in r/cadillacdeville, but I believe that I will (hopefully) gain more traction here:   
\---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
I inherited a Cadillac DeVille from my grandfather and I love the car so much. Unfortunately, I've noticed a couple of issues. I know that once the cause is located, it would be an easy fix. However, I'm having trouble locating the issue itself.

1 - Coolant Leak. We don't know where it's coming from and the guys at the shop have been unable to locate it as well. My entire reservoir leaked out a few days ago, in the span of minutes. So I need need need to figure out what is going on.

2 - Electrical Issues? I noticed this about a year ago. The stereo would work, but sometimes if I hit a bump, it would stop. I assumed it was my disc bouncing or something. I let a family member drive the car once and then the next time I drove it, the speaker did not come on. It has not come on since. I assumed a blown speaker (volume was all of the way up), but then I also noticed later: the AC was acting weird. Now, it doesn't automatically come on \*unless\* a bump is hit. I'm not sure if it's a motor issue (leaning toward this due to the fact the AC is being contrary), or if it is an electrical issue (connected to the speaker), nor am I sure how to look or address either problem. I've had 2-3 different car places look at my car (looking for coolant and ground-wires), none of them can figure it out (or they just don't care enough to look properly). I'm leaning toward a ground-wire, because in addition to the AC and Stereo, the gas-gauge isn't always correct. I'll be low on gas, and that's when it will begin going \*up.\* Plus, the license plate lights are out. I know that with GM vehicles, ground wire issues will lead to a lot of electrical problems.

The coolant is my main focus right now, so any help with that would be greatly appreciated. Once that is fixed, I can begin driving my car again. (AC and radio are secondary issues, lol). However, if anyone has any advice on what to check or what to fix for the rest of the issues on the car, or how to access the ground wires (if that \*is\* the issue), it would mean a tremendous amount.

Thank you for reading this! If anyone has any advice, please let me know. This car means a lot to me, and I really want to get it up to par again.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------  
Slight update since the original post from r/cadillacdeville:  
I was talking about this issue with my uncle, and he mentioned that coolant issues can be death sentences for these cars. Coolant issues could lead to: blown head-gaskets; overheating.   
If the car overheats, there's a chance it could warp the aluminum, and it's non-repairable, meaning I'd need an entirely new engine. 

So... I'm definitely starting to panic. Please help. "

We have an odd one here. Our key fob fails to be seen by the car. We replaced a couple of modules to try and fix the issue but it does not work. The odd part is that if we remove the battery power for like 30 minutes, plug it back in then it goes to working for a couple of days.

So a ""hard reset"" of sorts makes it work but then it later just stops seeing the key fob again. We had a new key fob made and programmed and it does not see it either.

Advice for ABS/VCS problem 2007 Toyota Camry
EDIT: Since posting, the power brakes have stopped working again.

My 2007 Toyota Camry Hybrid (200k miles) has been struggling the last year with power brake issues. I’ve already replaced the actuator, skid module, and rear speed sensors on the recommendation of my mechanic and Toyota dealership mechanics. I’ve also checked the brake fluid levels (this caused a warning light in the past).

Right now, the power brakes are still working (EDIT: no longer true, now they’re out again), but my dash is lit up with warnings about the ABS and VCS just like back when my power brakes were out.

Does anyone have any idea what might be causing this? I can only assume it’s electrical since I’ve done everything else to fix the problem. I’ve already spent ~$2,000 on her this year (worth it because she’s in amazing mechanical shape otherwise), and my mechanic is pretty much stumped at this point.

Any ideas are appreciated!"

Car window repair
Hi all!

Sorry if this isn't the right place, I'll also look for other subreddits.

I've got this issue, pictured, with the rear window of my car. The old window is coming away and the problem is getting worse. 

My plan to repair is thus:
1. Remove old window
2. get a plastic sheet, acetate or something, and impact cement it onto the rim where the old one was glued down
3. Cut it to size with a sharp implement. 

What do we think realistically of this plan? Any better suggestions?

Thanks!"

Stuck-open fuel injector causing white smoke
On another post, I commented that white smoke meant coolant burning.  I had a couple of guys comment that stuck-open fuel injectors will cause white smoke.  Every fuel injector I knew caused black smoke.  After a few comments, I realized that they were talking about GDI injectors, not the traditional ones.  I got very curious because GDI wasn't having issues before I got out of the business, so I didn't know about this failure.  There is no information out there other than the white smoke.  I'm the type of technician who needs to know how and why a failure occurs.  I don't accept ""it just happens"" as an appropriate answer.

I know that MFI injectors spray directly on top of the intake valves.  When stuck open, the injector will create a puddle on the intake valve between intake strokes.  The next intake stroke will pull that puddle, which is no longer atomized, into the combustion chamber with some oxygen.  It's probably not enough to foul the spark plug, so it ignites into black smoke, while the remaining fuel enters the exhaust and gets burned off and creating more black smoke.

I have a theory about the white smoke from a stuck-open GDI injector.  It injects fuel directly into the combustion chamber constantly.  It's probably enough to fuel-foul the spark plug and prevent it from sparking.  Then, all of the fuel going in would exit into the exhaust unburned.  It might be enough fuel to cool and prevent the catalytic converter from heating up enough to ignite the fuel.  So, the fuel boils out instead of igniting and burning black smoke.  That would create a white cloud.

I'm asking for confirmation of this theory.  Does anyone else know more about how this fuel can produce white smoke?"

Car won’t Crank/Start
Car: 2007 Camry LE 4 Cylinder

Just to summarize my situation…

About 2 Weeks ago my car battery went out on me, so I went to AutoZone and bought another one.

Put it into my Camry and the Car ran fine for about 10 Days until the battery died on me again. So went back to AutoZone and had them charge it, took it back home and the car would start fine again. Next Day left the house and ended up stranded at a Shopping center because the car wouldn’t turn on after coming back out of the store. Had to get towed home and when the tow guy tested my battery it displayed 5.6V but when I took the battery to AutoZone to have them tested it said “Good Battery” 100% Charge Status.

At this point I’m assuming that the alternator is trash because clearly the battery is not charging while driving. Sure enough after having all 3 test, Starter was trash as well as the Alternator capacitor. So I replaced all 3 today and had them tested at AutoZone and all 3 Passed as Good but yet AGAIN after driving for 1h, the car wouldn’t start.

Also once the car runs, there are no symptoms or anything that could indicate some sort of issue

I’m praying someone in here is able to help me narrow down what the problem could be…

Forgot to mention that everytime I put a new battery in, I can start the car 5-6 without problems and then it happens


I replaced:

Starter Alternator Battery Serpentine Belt

Thank you in advance!"

Vibrations Past 40mph 2005 Toyota Camry 2.4L
Howdy i've been having this issue of vibrations under acceleration past 40mph, even worse going uphill for about a couple weeks now, with a 2005 Toyota Camry XLE (2.4l) suspecting it to be cv joint or bad engine mounts; I finally took it to get diagnosed and the mechanic pointed out it happens in 4th to 5th (overdrive) and suspects the transmission's going out. Making note that there was black material, they assume was graphite in the ATF. Checked it for myself and it was brownish for how new the fluid was (changed about 3k miles ago) am I being stiffed or should I take the mechanic's word for it and hopefully find a replacement then?

I was in an accident in March and had my bumper replaced. Ever since they replaced it I have noticed that it won’t stay together. The tabs look like they were damaged (last picture). I took it back to them a few weeks after they repaired it when I noticed it was coming apart and I guess they just pushed it back together because it has been coming apart ever since they “fixed” it. I want to call them to have them look at it but it has been months so I just wanted to get opinions to see if this was a common issue or if it could be their fault.

2013 VW Polo 1.2 TDI – Juddering During Engine Braking Despite Extensive Repairs

Hi everyone, I’m facing a persistent juddering issue with my 2013 Volkswagen Polo 1.2 TDI (Diesel, 3-cylinder, manual). The car judders noticeably during engine braking—especially in lower gears and low RPMs—when I lift off the accelerator. Interestingly, the judder subsides once I press and release the clutch. There are no warning lights, and the engine runs smoothly otherwise, with good mileage and no stalling or pulling issues. Over the past few weeks, I’ve replaced engine and gearbox mounts (including the dogbone), lower arms, brake pads, clutch components, driveshafts, and even the throttle position sensor. I’ve also swapped the gearbox and flywheel. Tyres are new and alignment is done. Yet, the issue persists.

So far, everything mechanical seems covered, but I’m now wondering if the timing kit (belt/chain or tensioner), ECU mapping under deceleration, or internal gearbox/chassis dynamics could be the culprit. The vibrations are only present during engine braking—no throttle input. I'd really appreciate any technical insights, particularly if anyone has experienced similar behavior. Any thoughts on hidden causes or next steps before deeper internal diagnosis would be a great help. Thanks in advance!

Help! Cheap paint correction alternatives for swirl marks from using a sponge on my car
Used a kitchen sponge to wash the outside of my car (I know, bad idea but I was clueless at the time and I regret it deeply) in attempts to save money on a car wash. Well, the sponge left visible (but subtle) swirl marks all over the front hood and back hood of my car in certain areas where I scrubbed harder. The swirls look noticeably duller compared to the rest of the paint. I already tried using car wax and while it does make it less visible, it doesn't fix the issue and everytime I wash my car the scratch marks become visible again. My main concern is that since I'm a broke college student, I can't afford a thousand something dollar paint correction service. Are there any products or cheaper alternatives you guys could recommend to cover and seal these swirl marks?

Ticking Noise at Light Throttle – Opel Corsa D 1.0 Petrol (Video Attached)
Hi all,

I have a 2009 Opel Corsa D 1.0 petrol (3-cylinder), and I’m getting a ticking noise from the engine bay.

The ticking happens only when I press the gas lightly — not at idle and not under heavy acceleration.

It happens at any speed, and even in neutral.

The engine otherwise runs fine — no warning lights, no misfiring.


I’ve attached a short video where you can hear the sound. It seems to come from the timing chain side, but I can’t be sure.

Possible causes I’ve seen mentioned:

Timing chain tensioner or slack

Hydraulic lifters

Fuel injector ticking

PCV or vacuum flutter


I'd love to hear if anyone has had this exact issue — especially with a similar Corsa or engine. Thanks in advance.

Car makes a noise when I speed up
Okay so I just passed my MOT and 2 weeks after whenever I start driving, my car makes this weird noise on each rotation of the wheels turning on the road. It gets louder the faster I drive and when I creep the car slowly it stops.

I had the same issue last year after I passed my MOT. 2 weeks later the same thing, turned out I needed my ball bearings replaced on one side of my car. Surely this isn't the same issue. 

I did get 2 new tires fitted before tye MOT during the MOT check. Could this possibly be it?

Issue starting 2013 Ford F-150
My truck is a Ford F-150 2013 XL EcoBoost I bought it used recently and it only came with one key and it was not the administrative key so I had a new key made and the mechanic reset the key system to allow that key to be the administrative key. So now I have an administrative key and a second key. Also last week I put my keys into the ignition and while I did not turn the truck on the accessories were on and I walked away to do something and forgot about it. When I came out the next day my battery was dead. We jumped it and it has ran great ever since. I've also had it in the shop within the past month for a full tune up. I'm just adding these actions to the post in case any of these repairs have anything to do with the issue I'm having today. 

So today I go out and I start the truck up it starts up perfectly. I drive it over to my mom's house which is on the same property and I turn it off using my administrative key because I need to open her door with a key that is on that same key ring. My dogs are in the car so I turn it back on using the second key I have the non-administrative key so I can run the air and it will not start. I switch back to the administrative key and it will no longer start with that key either. 

The lights will come on All accessories and the doors will lock and unlock. It was showing an error of starting system fault. I checked the battery and while not running it was showing 12.6 volts. After doing a little research someone mentioned it could just be that it's a key issue or some sort of security system issue and to disconnect the battery for a little bit and reconnect. I did that and it did not make any difference. There is no clicking no attempt to turn over etc. 

Another thing I tried was checking all of the fuses in the kick box to make sure they are pressed in all of the way. Somebody mentioned that as well. Just wondering if anybody else has any advice or actions I could try. I feel like it must have something to do with the key since the issue happened when I switched to the second key after using the administrative key to start it. I will definitely call the mechanic tomorrow and inquire if he has ever had anything like this happen since he is the one who programmed the key. Thanks for any thoughts!"

2021 Silverado AC stops working randomly
This is a 2021 Chevy Silverado, and I have been having issues with my AC unit not working. It was working perfectly a week ago, when out of nowhere I got a P0073 and P0074 Code sent to my OBDII reader. It came up as my ambient air temperature sensor. I looked at the dash, and saw that it was reading the outside temperature as -40°f, and then 32°f, and jumps around sporadically. The AC will sporadically turn off and on, and has no seeming pattern. We've been stopped on the highway and it'll turn on, and when we move it goes away again. 

Obviously the first thing we did was replace the ambient air sensor in the passenger side mirror. I tested continuity between the AAT sensor plug and the wiring harness that connects to the sensor itself. It read something (2.4 0.42... something I'm writing this for my father). After that did not work, I unplugged the battery to attempt to reset the ECM, Sensors, etc. 

When that didn't work, we bought a GM scanner to attempt to reset the Ambient Air Temperature Sensor. It says it's resetted and reads correctly, but the minute you drive off, the AC Shuts off and throws a code (P0073 & P0074). I've attempted to delete the code, but the code itself never deletes. I'll see 2 codes delete, but I still have 2 codes show as P0073 Permanent, and P0074 Permanent. The check engine light goes away, and then when I turn the truck on, the code comes back. 

What could be my possible issues? I've replaced the AAT Sensor twice, and don't think I have anything compressor wise wrong, as it will randomly kick on and blast cold air. "

Is it worth the risk to do this ourselves?
My fiancé and I have an issue with the airbag light being on in his 2012 Hyundai Elantra Limited. 

The codes are: B1346 Driver Airbag Resistance Too High (1st Stage) and B1481 Driver Airbag Resistance Too High (2nd Stage). 

We predict the problem to be with either the wires or connections in the steering wheel. We doubt the clock spring is the issue because he doesn’t have any other symptoms of a bad clock spring (difficulty turning wheel, horn not working, buttons on wheel not working etc.) The only symptom is the airbag light being on. 

After doing research, the process to get in there to check the connections seems fairly straightforward. Disconnect the battery for an hour. Release all three pins holding the airbag on, and the panel just comes right off for us to check the wires and connections. The panel just pops right back on afterwards. 

Is this too dangerous to do ourselves? Is spending the $300-500 to have someone else do this worth it? Is there anything that we need to be aware of if we chose to do this? Any advice is appreciated. Thank you."

Suspected FPR diaphragm issue
Hello, I have a 2004 VW polo 9N 1. 4l petrol. The car sometimes (yes, not always) has a crank and no start condition after being stopped for 1-4 hours (though less than an hour is possible but rare). Being parked overnight or for multiple days doesnt cause this issue. Additionally, the car can be started and stopped multiple times within short periods of time with no issues. Additionally, the car does not have rough idle, no stalling issues, no smoke from exhaust, doesnt consume oil. When crank no start condition happens, fuel scent be smelled from the engine but no visible spalshes anywhere. Therefore i believe the engine gets flooded. I believe the cause may be a broken fuel pressure regulator diaphragm. It can take as little as waiting 10 mins and trying again or trying multiple starting attempts at different time intervals for 2 hours but eventually the car wll start at low rpm and after some rough idle for a couple of seconds everything works fine (see attached video). To my understanding, my car has a returnless fuel system meaning the FPR is located somewhere in the fuel pump. My main questions are:

1. Am i right to suspect the FPR to be the cause. 

2. To replace the FPR in my returnless fuel system, do i need to replace the fuel pump itself or the fuel pump assembly (white outer shell containing the fuel pump inside it)?

 Appreciate any advice!"

Diagnosis Check: Clock Spring Replacement (2016 Santa Fe Sport)
Does this sound like I am on the right track?  
  
So, my radio, voice, etc. controls on the steering wheel stopped working and I think I have determined that it is because the Clock spring in the steering wheel needs to be replaced. I have a basic diagnostic code reader, but it doesn't seem to have a code for this.  
I diagnosed the issue by noticing that the controls don't work at all when the steering wheel is straight, but the controls will intermittently work if the wheel is turned almost all the way to the right.

I can't seem to find any other viable explanation. The car is paid off and WELL out of any warranty (obviously) so am hoping to do this myself. The actual work is well within my capability, but I am just surprised that this is a $200+ USD part! So wanted to sanity check my theory before I dropped good $ on such an expensive part.

Wtf Toyota - Passenger Lower Control Arm Replacement
Hey all—

Working on my 2006 Toyota Highlander, refreshing the front suspension. Everything went fine until I tried to replace the passenger side lower control arm… and ran face-first into Toyota’s bracket-from-hell.

The issue:
The passenger side engine mount bracket that attaches to the block has 4 bolts. I got 3 out—including that lovely hidden E-Torx star bolt near the intake. But there’s a 4th bolt tucked between the mount and the bracket, behind the rubber isolator, and it looks impossible to remove without slamming into the mount itself.

I attached a diagram that shows the exact bracket layout—this is factory service manual stuff, not a sketch.

⸻

Here’s the deal:

I’ve tried:
	•	Jacking the engine from the bellhousing
	•	Loosening the transmission and torque mounts
	•	Unbolting the mount-to-chassis hardware
	•	Multiple jack angles
	•	Carefully removing all accessible bolts

But that last bolt is dead center behind the rubber isolator, and even if I get a slim wrench in there, I’m not sure it’ll clear the bracket on the way out—it’ll likely hit the mount.

⸻

My plan:
	•	Go back in with a flex-head slim ratcheting wrench and just try to loosen the 4th bolt—not fully remove it.
	•	Hoping the bracket is slotted, and I can slide it off the bolt shaft once it’s loose.
	•	Worst case, I try again after nudging the engine a few more mm up.

⸻

My question:

Has anyone here actually removed this bracket without pulling the engine or mangling something?

If so—how?
And if not… Toyota… what the fuck. 😩

Is the ECU the only thing that would command the idle air control valve plunger to move in and out or does something else move it? Can a car still run with a damaged ECU?
2006 Mitsubishi Lancer ES 2.0L, 61,000 miles

My mechanic is saying that most likely my ECU has failed which is why I'm getting low idling stalling issues because the ECU is not telling the idle air control valves to allow more air to raise the idle speed. When I turn on stuff like the AC or circulation fans the idles drops, but never recovers and idles up to compensate for the increase load. It just drops and drops till it stall and triggers the check engine light. He discovered coolant was leaking into the idle air control valve chamber from a old gasket and thinks that coolant got into the OEM idle air control valve motor causing it to short out and then that short possibly fried something on the ECU as well. The idle air control valve is OEM and its only 1 1/2 years old. Throttle body is cleaned and MAF sensor was cleaned too and it didn't fix the issue. Before he thought it was the ECU he tried to replace the idle air control valves 2 times with 2 Standard Motor Product idle air control valves and the plunger on both wouldn't move when it was plugged it and he tested their resistance Ohms on both and they were within range. Harnesses look fine. The car also cranks on and runs, but it idles low. Right now it feels like the ECU is damaged and it is not telling the idle air control valves to retract and allow air into the throttle body.

Do you guys also think its the ECU too? Could the car still start and run with a damaged ECU?"

Right window won’t move?
Subject: Issue with Right Window on Ford Fiesta 

I have an issue with my Ford Fiesta 2009. The right window is currently not going up or down. Based on the symptoms, I suspect it might be related to a fuse problem.

Does any one know which fuse it is so I can try a replacement?

Advice on a few (hopefully) small things that I'd like to fix on my baby
I've got a few little things on my 2018 Equinox that have been bugging me, and/or I might want to get fixed before they become worse. Any tips/ tricks/ advice anyone has would be appreciated. 

•There's a crack on the outside bottom of my driver's seat. Any way to cheaply fix that?
•This crazing(?) of the tint that's happening on my doors. It's there anything that I can do about this?
•Condensation in my driver's side taillight. 
•This trim part by my driver's side front tire is pulling away. 
•(not pictured) The hitch cover came off years ago because it was loose from the beginning. Is there a way to fix that?

Overall, how much do you think this would all cost?

Also, not cosmetic, but my windshield wipers are acting funky. Like, the front will sometimes wipe at irregular intervals. Like: wipe ... wipe ... wipe wipe . wipe ... wipe... etc. Also, recently, the back one will wipe occasionally when the only the front ones are on. I used to own a Blazer and I remember that used to happen with her, too. Is it a fuse/ electric issue, or just a weird Chevy thing?"

hey guys just wondering if anyone can help. My car (2016 chevy equinox) has been stalling at traffic lights. it restarts normally, but this last time it struggled to. I’ve replaced my camshaft sensors, camshaft positioner, spark plugs, ignition coils, i’ve had my fuel injectors cleaned. oil level is fine, transmission oil is fine. Idk what else to do and it’s too expensive to have it diagnosed at a shop again.

Dodge issue
Hi, I bought a Dodge Grand caravan 2018. Good car but after a few days it started having an issue. The issue is when coming to a stop the car would jitter and most of the times turn off. It was sitting for around 5 months so this is what I'm thinking. Old fuel can be causing it to run rough. Bad spark plugs. I cleaned out the throttle body and it started running better, barely jittering when I stop but never turned off. After driving to work it started happening again. Although I might have not done a good job. When coming to a stop and putting it into neutral it doesn't jitter. That's how I've been driving it. Any idea what the issue could be. Ive been reading and heard it could be something to do with torque converter clutch or solenoid."

Valve Cover Repair?
Hello, recently took my car in for an oil change. It is a 2016 Chevy Trax. I hadn’t noticed any issues with the car previously. When I go pick it up they suggest I get the valve cover replaced due to the engine having a vacuum leak. Today definitely noticed that I had a hard time accelerating and when I stopped it was rumbling. They recommend “replacing the intake and valve cover”. The quote they gave me is $1114.75. Do you think this is a fair price? Any help would be greatly appreciated, thanks!!"

Bumper respray, colour seems a little off
Hi all,

Got my front bumper resprayed and I’m not sure how accurate the colour match is.

Can I get some professional opinions pls.

It looks good in sunlight hard to tell, but sometimes it just looks slightly more purple than the rest of the car. 

I’m planning to go back to the paint shop and get the colour checked using that code gun - thinking to buy the paint myself this time and get another respray from the same shop.

The paint shop however, said this particular colour is very hard to get right, and he’s always had issues with it.

Any suggestions?

Strange issue with 2010 Dodge Journey
So here's the background: A few days ago the car was starting up as normal. Cut to yesterday when I try and start it up in a parking lot and get just a click click click from the starter. No biggie. I hook up my jump pack, hit the button, and when I turn the key the engine turns over before promptly stopping entirely. I fiddle with the wire harness, try again, it starts. 

Now however as I am driving the e-brake light comes on as I approach 20 and I get a momentary dip in power before it goes back to normal as I reach 30. But every time I get stopped and need to speed up again, same thing. Finally get home and try and start the car with no pack; clickclickclick nothing.

I suspect it might be the wiring harness or the battery needs replaced (though it's barely 3 years old) but I wanted to get the opinions of folks who might know better"

LED taillight issue.
I changed out my wife’s Evo X taillights with some LED ones. I already had to take it to a shop to figure out where and how to install some resistors for the back up light due to it cutting off the reverse camera after about 3 seconds. Everything works BUT this fancy little animation it’s supposed to do at startup. It has manual switches on each side to turn this feature on or off. If I have it on, the right side taillight will just keep restarting the animation over and over until it stays on. If we push the brake pedal they both work just fine, I’m not sure why it’s doing this. Has anyone else run into an issue like this? These are the lights I installed. https://a.co/d/bnCsUKW"

What should I do?
I have a 2017 Buick Encore, yes, huge mistake, never had a Buick and didn’t do the research I should have. About a month and a half after I purchased, the check engine light came on, took it for a code read and got the P0420 Catalytic converter code, since I had still been in the first couple months the dealer went ahead and replaced the catalytic converter no charge, they did try to make me pay a diagnostic fee but I fought that. However here I am, 3 months later with the check engine again, code reading same exact code. 

Any idea what it could be? What should I do at this point? 

Seems pretty clear they didn’t try to find the actual issue and just changed the part. Not sure how to handle or go about it. Thanks"

Mercedes A160 (W169) Non-Start Issue - Intermittent Click, No Crank
Hello everyone,

I'm hoping for some guidance on a intermittent starting issue with my 2010 Mercedes A160 (W169). Automatic CVT gearbox, ~160000 kilometers.

When I turn the key, all I get is a single click. It sounds like it's coming from either under the hood or the relay area in the front passenger footwell. There are no other sounds – no crank, no whirring. The dashboard is completely clear of unexpected warning lights, only shows the default set of indications typical for a not-running car, and my basic ODB-II app shows no error codes. Interestingly, if I pull the starter fuse, there's no click at all when I turn the key — maybe it's obvious, but adding this in case it helps to narrow something down.

The issue first appeared a week ago, then reseating the starter fuse helped, and the car started normally for several days. But later the problem returned, and reseating the fuse doesn't help anymore.

I tried changing the car battery thinking the previous one was too old, but it didn't help. The voltage on the new battery is 12.3 V without load, dropping to 11.6 V when I try to start. Can this voltage still be too low? I thought if that were the case, the car would report that, but there were no messages on the dashboard.

I checked and reseated all fuses; all seem to be OK. I reseated all relays (in the feet space of the front passenger), but did not check them as I didn't know how.

Another thing I noticed is that with the ignition ON and with the brake pedal pressed it's not always possible to change a gear from P to, say, N (the gearbox is automatic CVT). I could not find some pattern in when I could or could not change the gear. Can a related sensor be causing the starting problem?

What could be causing this seemingly intermittent issue? Is there anything else I could realistically check before I have to tow it to the repair shop? I'm really hoping it's not a faulty starter motor!

Any insights or troubleshooting tips would be hugely appreciated! Thanks in advance!"

2006 Scion XA code P0103 and P0456
Hello. I had a problem last 6/18/25. It was raining bad and I had no choice but to drive througha puddle. I was able to drive the car into a parking and it stopped working. The car starts and dies immediately. It gave me the code P0103 because I had a scanner with me. As a woman, not knowing anything about cars. I had it towed to a mechanic that I usually go to. Take note: The first owner of the car had it modified, a friend of mine said that the car does not have the original airbox so it is exposed.

They looked at it and called me to say they fixed it. I picked it up 6/20. I asked them what the issue was and mechanic told me that the water did not get to the engine (so I thought whew that's a good thing) they said that they used a product to clean the MAF sensor. They charged me $300 for it.

The car was driving fine after I picked it up. Now 6/26/25, I started the car and it had check engine lights on and I used my scanner and it is giving me P0103 again and now added: P0456. I don't know but I've been reading about the codes. I don't want to accuse mechanic but I wanted to ask for an opinion from all of you. What should I do?? What could be the problem? 

I called the mechanic and said that the code came back with another code which was the evap leak and I was told to take the car back so they can look at it and I might need a new maf sensor. Have it towed to the shop 

They should've addressed it properly the first time right? Paying for labor that high is a problem for me because I'm not rich. I don't know what would happen next.


Please give me an idea on how to work it out, what do I say to the mechanic or whatever that can help me. Since the car is starting, I might try to drive it to the mechanic."

Car won’t Crank/Start
Car: 2007 Camry LE 4 Cylinder

Just to summarize my situation…

About 2 Weeks ago my car battery went out on me, so I went to AutoZone and bought another one.

Put it into my Camry and the Car ran fine for about 10 Days until the battery died on me again. So went back to AutoZone and had them charge it, took it back home and the car would start fine again. Next Day left the house and ended up stranded at a Shopping center because the car wouldn’t turn on after coming back out of the store. Had to get towed home and when the tow guy tested my battery it displayed 5.6V but when I took the battery to AutoZone to have them tested it said “Good Battery” 100% Charge Status.

At this point I’m assuming that the alternator is trash because clearly the battery is not charging while driving. Sure enough after having all 3 test, Starter was trash as well as the Alternator capacitor. So I replaced all 3 today and had them tested at AutoZone and all 3 Passed as Good but yet AGAIN after driving for 1h, the car wouldn’t start.

Also once the car runs, there are no symptoms or anything that could indicate some sort of issue

I’m praying someone in here is able to help me narrow down what the problem could be…

Forgot to mention that everytime I put a new battery in, I can start the car 5-6 without problems and then it happens


I replaced:

Would a car start up this way?
Long ass story short  as possible 

Crank no start- self diagnosed fuel pump not getting power. Ruled everything out but wiring, sent it to the garage to known for electrical repairs. 
They called and said the car was ready. Claimed the issue was the fuel line not connected.  Told us it was running. They charged us $199 for diagnostics. 

We went to leave, car wouldn't start. They said they'd look at it. 
Sent us the below picture and claimed we had a broken ground wire. When we came to pick it up, they charged us a second diagnostic fee of $199.

Now my question is, if this wire wasn't connected,  would the car have started? 

And IF it wasn't broken, and it broke on the alleged test drive, wouldn't the car have stalled on them?

My supposition is that either they never started the car and assumed the fuel line was the problem, or they broke the wires and nit only used about it, but charged us extra.

Am I being crazy?

2008 Hyundai Sonata ignition lock cylinder replacement
I've been having problems with the ignition locking up in my Hyundai for quite some time. I read online that the problem might be a worn down key, so I started using the spare and it solved the problem for several months.

This week, both keys stopped working.

The mechanic says it needs a new lock cylinder and quoted me $700.

I'm considering getting a new car over this because it needs a few other repairs and has 246,000 miles on it. However, I also wouldn't mind holding off on a new car until I can save a little more money. I cannot afford an additional monthly payment. 

I kind of want to know how delicate of an operation this kind of repair is? I have a trustworthy acquaintance who does car repairs out of his garage as a favor to people he knows. He charges money, but much less than a real shop. He's pretty talented and has done a lot of work on his own cars and has helped me with minor repairs. I've never asked him to do something major. 

Is this something a skilled non-professional could do fairly easily? Or is it a complex job? If I can get the cost of the repair down some, it would be worth it. Then I would have some breathing room to car shop instead of being in crisis mode over it. "

Do I Need To Replace The Crank & Bearings?
**Kia Sportage LX 2016, 2.4L, 110k miles - Engine Light & Top End Rattle/Knocking**

Here is where I am at....

**TL;DR - Contemplating replacing crankshaft, connecting rods and bearings. How many specialized tools do I need, can I do it without removing the engine from the car, what other costs will I have like gaskets, silicone, oil etc?**

**Problem**:

\-Initially had P0014 code - Exhaust camshaft position timing over-advanced (Bank 1)  
\-Then had P0016 code - Crankshaft Position – Camshaft Position Correlation (Bank 1 Sensor A)  
\-Engine wont rev above 2,000 RPM without top of engine rattling and making a lot of noise  
\-Engine splutters under any load when driving.  
\-Check engine light has been reset and is no longer showing  
\-No OBD codes despite the engine sounding awful

**Possible reasons:**

🆕 Defective/damaged Camshaft Position Sensor (changed)  
👍 Defective/damaged VVT Solenoid (tested and functional)  
🆕 Defective/damaged timing chain & tensioners (changed)  
👍 Engine is somehow gotten itself out of time, so camshaft/timing needs reset (reset)  
❓Damaged camshafts  
🤦‍♂️ Low oil

**What I have tried so far:**

❌ Oil level checked, it literally didn't register on the dipstick?! The oil/filter was changed in July and level was fine when they showed me the dipstick. I added almost 4 quarts of oil to get it above minimum level. (I know, I know, check the oil!!)

❌ Checked exhaust VVT solenoid - Correct volts in wiring loom, within ohms limits and operates when power applied. Thoroughly cleaned it and reinstalled. (see image)

❌ Replaced camshaft position sensor. Wiring loom has correct voltages. Not able to test old sensor due to sealed wiring connector so could not test voltage draw when metal applied to sensor. Replaced as assumed it was faulty due to lack of testing ability. 

❌ Checked timing marks were all aligned. They weren't, inlet cam was misaligned. (see image)

❌ Changed timing chain and oil pump chain.

❌ Changed all tensioners

❌ Changed drive belt.

❌ Removed oil pan, thoroughly cleaned it

❌ Removed as much sludge as possible from inside the engine

❌ Checked spark plugs (look slightly melted and coated (see image)

**Next steps I am considering:**

⚠️ Remove camshafts, inspect for wear and if required, replace them  
⚠️ Split the engine and inspect the crankshaft and if required, fix issues  
⚠️ Split the engine and inspect the crankshaft and if required, fix issues

**My request:**

What else am I missing or should I be considering as the Kia dealership is not an option as they want to charge a fortune just to diagnose the issue.

I am thinking the likely culprit would be the camshaft sprockets are defective and skipping and/or the crankshaft bearings. I am more than competent and can do the work myself if I don't need to remove the engine from the car.

Being blunt, I am down to my last $600 and just don't have the money to fix the issues myself, never mind a dealer!"

My key fob only locks and unlocks the door, and it also has a button for the car alarm as well as to pop the trunk.

About a year ago, I noticed that the key fob battery was starting to go out, so I replaced it. Whenever I did so, the fob no longer communicates with the car at all. Its definitely not the new battery, as I've tested it with a multimeter and it's reading as it should. I've taken it to a locksmith to see if they could pair the key fob to the car again, but no luck. Ultimately, I took the car to the Kia dealership to see what was going on, but they weren't able to help either. They told me that the car's receiver is working as it should, and the fob's transmitter is working perfectly, but the two just won't connect with one another. I ended up buying an aftermarket key fob replacement that my local locksmith orders from and a new fob won't pair to the car either. The locksmith tested both the original key fob and the new one, and they are both transmitting great sho he was stumped. I genuinely don't know what could possibly be going on, but id really prefer not spending the few hundred dollars that the dealership wants to charge for a new fob that they told me ""might not even fix the problem"". Would anyone know anything about what is going on here? Any help would be greatly appreciated."

Can a garage demand additional payment after the fact?
This is kind of a long story, and obviously not DIY-related, but I could use some insight from the hive mind. The tl/dr is that my garage told me that a repair would be covered by my extended warranty, but the day after I picked up the car they called and said the warranty company changed its mind and didn't authorize the full amount, and that I need to pay the $600 difference.

I took my car (2018 Audi Q5) in last week because it was leaking coolant. Took it in in the morning of Day 1, they told me they'd give me a call when they figured out what was wrong with it. Kept it overnight without calling to update me first. When I called on Day 2 I was told they'd already ordered the hoses it needed and that they'd be in later that day. I said I had an extended warranty that should cover the work (MaxCare purchased through CarMax), and gave the guy the information. He later called back to tell me the work had been authorized and to tell me what my share would be: deductible plus the difference between the labor rate the plan will pay and what the garage charges. I live in NYC so it didn't surprise me their rate was higher than what the plan will pay. 

When I picked up my car at the end of Day 2, a man I took for the owner told me he had ""good news"" for me: they'd found torn engine mounts and put in a claim with MaxCare to cover that too without my paying a second deductible. But this was the day before Thanksgiving and they hadn't actually done the work yet, so he told me to bring the car back in the following week. They hadn't called me before putting in this claim. But I agreed to come back.

Brought the car back in this week to get the engine mounts replaced and they took it upon themselves to do a NY state inspection on the car too without talking to me about it first. It was due, but I was annoyed at yet more bad communication. I've moved around a lot and used a number of mechanics, and I expect at a minimum that they call me when they've diagnosed the problem, give me an estimate, and get my ok before ordering parts/starting work/putting in claims on my extended warranty. Not to mention that they should call me promptly when the car is ready, which also didn't happen on either visit here.

It was another 2-day repair, and when I picked up the car I was only charged for the inspection. 

The next day I got a call from the garage explaining that my extended warranty had ""changed their mind"" and not covered the full amount of the engine mount replacement, and that I owe more than $600. Apparently the warranty company was unwilling to cover either the full number of hours put in or the full labor rate. I said I really don't think their dispute with the warranty company should be my problem and that they led me to believe this was fully covered. I also don't think this should be a surprise to the garage given that the warranty company also didn't pay full labor costs on the original hose replacement. I don't seem to have signed anything to the effect that I was responsible for a difference in costs between what extended warranty covered and what the garage charged.

So, do I have an obligation to pay this? Either way I'll be looking for a garage with better communication for future repairs. Thanks if you've read this far!"

AC Compressor Question
My AC Compressor went out so I got it replaced. Several months later it failed so I went back and got it replaced. And once again it has started leaking in the past day or 2. What is the problem? I’ve gotten it repaired by the same local repair shop. 

They will charge me for labor if I go back. Which I think isn’t right. I’ve had repairs done on past vehicles and have never had the same part fail a second time. Why am I having so much trouble me with this one?

Charged $800 for engine misfire 
Hi, i need an advice. 

I had my first engine problem a few days ago, and went to the nearest autoshop - firestone to get it fixed. 

Turned out to be an engine misfiring and was charged $800 to replace compartements. (I have 0 knowledge on cars, was panic and rushed so i just trusted the mechanics there). 

I waited nearly 3.5 hours mostly because it took hours for the parts to be deilvered from their warehouse. Actual labor time seemed about 30-60min. 

Seems like multiple ignition coils (charged $440) and spark plugs ($270) were replaced and charged $110 for  diagnostic test.

I dont have a quote or receipt in my hand yet - they said it will be sent to my email but never got it, im going to stop by the store tomorrow to get the paper receipt - i remember how much they charged me for the parts because the guy showed me the monitor with the price. 

Im driving 2003 saturn (78k miles). does $800 seem reasonable price or a rip off? If it was a rip off, is there anyway i get a refund? 

I'm really sad because i feel like they took advantage of my lack of knowledge on cars and got money out of it. Thank you 😞

Mercedes 2010 gxl 350 won't start 


Hello, so my girlfriends gxl 350 2010 will not turn over, the steering wheel and breaks are also locked. We just drove 6 hours to her parents place and we had no trouble with the car until we got here. The next day we woke up went to turn on the car and we got nothing. There is no clicking sound when we try to turn it over and the battery is fully charged. Like I said the steering wheel is locked and so are the breaks. When we put the keys into the ignition it says on her dashboard to take the keys out. What could the problem be and is there anyway for us to fix it? We are pretty far from a dealership and it would cost her 750 to just get towed to the closest one. Has anyone else had this problem? Any advice would be great? "

Hyundai AC contamination 
Hi Guys,
Two months ago, a bird went in my hyundai elantra 2021 and destroyed my AC Condenser sheet and caused a freon leak. I paid $170 for agency’s inspection charge thinking it was a warranty issue, it turned out to be a bird. I paid them $1200 for the repair to recharge and replace sheet. Unfortunately, agency has come up with another problem saying my refrigerant is contaminated and has a freon that it is not supposed to have. If they turn AC on, it will reach compressor or has already reached compressor that will damage it. So i need to replace my compressor now. They took the freon out as well to avoid more damage. No one ever touched my AC before, so not sure how that gas got there. 
I took it to a mechanic to get a second opinion who recharged AC to see if compressor was working. He said 3% contamination wont do shit to your AC and compressor is not working because the sheet they replaced, Freon is freezing on the sheet due to blockage. So idk what to do now"

Engine rattling/clanking sound during road trip. 
Hi everyone,

I’m new to this sub so I hope I’m in the right place. I am currently on vacation traveling around different countries in Europe by car. The car started getting a rattling/clanking sound from the front of the engine. Everything else has been in good shape. No sign of overheating. I took it to the first mechanic shop I saw on the road and left it there while we went to a camp site nearby. 

The checked it and said it’s the water pump and it needs urgent replacement. They’re charging me 350 euros to get the job done. They also said that because the water pump is moving it already messed up a couple other little spinning components that I have no idea what they are. 

The car is a 2016 Mercedes vito. Do you think it indeed could be the water pump, and if it is the water pump is it truly an emergency that needs to be taken care of right now? How long could I possibly wait before getting it repaired? Does the price seem fair for that kind of a problem? 

Thanks so much for you input! "

Tire repeatedly low but never flat. Confused. 
I noticed one of my Michelin premium a/s tires-about 4/5 years old bought new at costco-being repeatedly low. Usually at 26 pressure when supposed to be 33 front/32 back. drop happens most frequently when temperatures change but not always. What can be causing the problem? Had tires (size 205/55r16) rotated recently and technician didn’t say anything concerning about tire when filling it up. I drive under 10k miles/yr, which is not a crazy amount but also the car is not sitting still either. I did notice I may have a slight misalignment that is causing uneven wear on one tire. It is getting annoying how often I need to go to fill up with air. I don’t own compressor so I’m driving around my city frustratingly trying to find an air station that works or does not charge me an arm and a leg. Could misalignment be causing it? Or do I need just new tires? I’m feeling deflated by the whole situation! Pun intended. "

I'm frustrated and confused with the ongoing saga of my car issues. First, my passenger side tailight and right side license plate light stopped working, although the brake light on that side still functions. I took my car to a mechanic, hoping for a quick fix, but instead, they told me it was related to my remote start and referred me to another mechanic. However, the second mechanic debunked that theory and said the problem lies with the SJB fuse box underneath my dash. Now, I've been referred to the dealership, which is a daunting prospect given their expensive rates. I'm worried I'll be charged upwards of $1000, and I'm unsure what to do next.

2004 CRV - Random battery light. Charging system passes test. Battery usually passes test
Brand new battery. 2 year old Denso reman. alternator. Basically I've been getting a flickering battery light, mostly over 3500rpm probably starting about a month or so ago. Ran both a battery test and a charging test with my tester and had Autozone run a test with their tester and everything passed. Decided to sort of ignore it for a couple of weeks as I was stumped on what was going on.  
  
But recently I noticed it was more frequent and last week suddenly I was getting a steady battery light when I would start the car and it would stay on for around 4-5 minutes before going it. Flickering battery light would still show up over and around 3500 fairly frequently. I reran the tests and the charging test passed but the battery test failed telling me replace but ONLY if I did the battery test with the car running. With the car off it tested fine. Even took the battery out of the car, brought it Autozone and they did a full test on the battery and it passed just as it passed with engine off in the car when I tested it.

I was stumped and went home to do some more troubleshooting. Decided to pull the battery out of our Altima and connect it to the CRV and rerun the battery test with the engine running just to see if it too would show up REPLACE but instead it passed fine. So now I am thinking, its got to be my battery thats bad because it tests fine with battery from my other car. So figured ok, my battery is 4 years old. Maybe even though it test fine, at least with car off, maybe there is something wrong with it. So I bought a new Diehard Gold battery and put in. And bingo. Just like with the Altimas battery hooked up all tests passed whether engine was running or not. So I considered problem solved and that it was indeed a flaky battery issue with my 4 year old Interstate battery.

A week goes by and no battery light issues. Then suddenly 2 days ago I turn the car on and bam, battery light comes on. Again it lasts maybe 5 minutes and goes off. Of course the flickering battery light at high RPM returns as well. I rerun the battery tests and I am again getting replace battery when running the test with engine off, at least sometimes. Occasionally it will still pass with engine off.

Upon closer inspection of the testers readings I notice that when I run the test with the engine off the CCA reading hits around 550cca (Battery is a 500CCA). But when I run the test with the engine on the CCA reading drops alot, sometimes by half. Seems that the low CCA reading might be what is triggering the tester to diagnose it as Replace but I cannot understand why I am getting such a low reading with the engine running.

Here are the readings on the last round of tests

2011 Avalon Does Not Detect Car Battery 
2011 Toyota Avalon sat without being driven and the battery got too low to start the car. I hooked up two different car batteries to the Avalon and it had power but would not start. 

Some forums said it could be the key fob. Key fob was super old so I put in a new battery. After changing the key fob battery I connected the car's battery back up. Now absolutely nothing works. No lights whatsoever will turn on. The car acts like it does not even detect that the car battery is connected.

I have hooked the car battery up to two different battery chargers which both indicate that the battery is sufficiently charged. The little red light on the key fob does come on when I press the button so I believe the key fob is not the problem. Anyway even without the key fob working the car should have some lights and sounds when you push the start button or hit the horn. 

The car is getting zero electricity. It is as if when I originally tried hooking up those other batteries to get the car to start I must have tripped some master breaker? Any ideas on what could be the problem would be greatly appreciated before I send for a mobile mechanic.

2011 Kia Forte Ex Starting Problems
My Forte isn't starting for some reason.  I turn the key and I get nothing.  Just the usual lights on the dashboard.  I've gone down the list of possible suspects:

1. Alternator is fine.  No loss of power when it *was* running.
2. Starter was checked at Autozone and is fine.
3. Battery is fully charged.  Tried to jump start off of my other car with no luck.
4. Starter relay was checked and is fine.

My only guess is the ignition lock cylinder has gone bad.  I remember a few times leading up to total failure when the car wouldn't start unless I turned the key a couple of times to ""wake up"" the starter.

My question is this:  If the ignition cylinder is swapped and it's still not starting, could a dealer-installed starter interrupter on the car cause problems?  The car was paid off last year and Express Auto told me that they closed their connection to the vehicle, but they never removed the hardware.   Do people just pull that assembly themselves when they no longer have a lien?  Thanks for any ideas.

Update:  Located and removed the starter interrupter from the dealership and reconnected the wires it was bypassing, but no change in starting.  So I'm assuming the problem is the ignition lock cylinder."

2015 Ford Focus se not starting
2015 Ford Focuse se 2.0 L 4-cylinder hatchback.
A couple days ago my car decided to not start. It had full dashboard lights and the radio worked but the car would not start. A nice bystander had a battery charger and my battery was reading 12.5-12.8v. We let it sit and charge anyways, no start, we then tried jumping it with his car and still no start. I have it towed back to my house and later that night for the heck of it I tried starting it and it started right up no problem. I took advantage of the situation and ran to the store, turning the car off then back on no problem. It keeps starting with no problems for another day and a half and then suddenly decided not to start again. Everyone I talked to told me 100% it's the starter so I hoped to save some cash and skipped the diagnosis and just had the starter replaced this morning. I took the car out for a test run, stoped at the gas station and turned it off, to go in, and back on with no issues. I'm not sure if I accidentally hit a button or not but the truck randomly opened while i was about to pull out. I drove a little since i was at a place i could stop and pulled into a prking lot to shut it. Put the car in park and shut the trunk without shutting the car off. Went to take the car out of park and the car shut off so I pulled the key and tried to start it back up. When I put the key back in the car not only didn't start but I had no electricals pop on. I had an other bystander help jump my car and the dashboard lights turned immediately on but no dome lights and I couldn't roll up my window. A different bystander came up with a battery charger and it was reading 12.6v. I couldn't get it to start so I had it towed back home. I had to go to work in the meantime but when I got back in fear that it's going to rain in the morning I went out to try to roll up my window and the car started no problem. I'm hoping that one you fine individuals might know what's going on.

1997 BMW Z3 Roadster 4 Cylinder engine 1.9L
So my mom has had this car for around 6 years, and it worked when she bought it. It's a manual car and she wanted to learn to drive stick but never did because she is super busy, so the car wasn't driven enough the first 2 years she had it. The main problem back then was mostly the battery dying or some small problem, but for some reason she decided to let the car run in our driveway for almost a whole day, she's not a mechanic and has no car experience so she was definitely not thinking of anything going wrong, I think she just wanted the car to warm up or something??? Anyway near the end of the day smoke or steam came out from under the hood and the car hasn't been able to turn on since. Mechanics have come out to check on it but either give crazy quotes in hopes of buying the car from my mom or aren't experienced enough to find a solution. The things different mechanics have said over the years is alternator issue, fuel injector issue, and a fuel pump issue. The last mechanic apparently did replace the fuel pump but it still wont turn on.

This has become my project car now since my mom doesn't have any mechanical skills, any ideas on what I should replace or where I should start looking for solutions would be greatly appreciated. My next steps are going to be getting the battery charged, seeing if I can get any codes to show up on my Scanner, and maybe replacing the fuel injectors and the alternator."

Mechanic shop replaced both front struts. On the bill, only one item is listed. ""Parts $700. 0$ labor."" This seems unusual to me. And then they found/created new problems.
For context, we found out that my dad's car had a damaged front strut spring, cracked and hanging off the bottom. The broken off piece, half a loop, was rattling around when the car hit bumps. The noise was gone after removing the broken piece but the strut needed to be replaced for obvious safety concerns. Brought it to a shop where both struts where replaced as a recommendation. The bill showed a single line of $700 parts. $0 labor. Besides the lack of itemization the car drove worse after the repair.

Our guess is that the shop likely damaged some components while replacing the struts but won't admit it directly. The least damning explanation is that they didn't even bother test driving the car after the repair. My dad had paid the bill and started driving away until he noticed the car was making new, much more concerning noises. He went back to complain and question what happened. The shop played it off at first and wanted to charge an additional $500 parts and labor to fix the  new problem. After pointing out the fact the noises weren't there beforehand, they settled on only charging parts for $240. It had to be kept in the garage for the next day to fix the new problem... A problem which the shop likely caused but won't admit fault or even provide an itemized quote. Tomorrow we'll see if the situation gets worse. Another problem pops up or they decide to charge more since nothing is in writing. I wasn't involved directly but I wouldn't go back after this is over."

Battery vs alternator
Last week my ‘14 Ford Edge (3.6, AWD) came back from a shop after getting work done on the rear diff, power control unit, & water pump.

It was driven back and forth to work for a few days (25 min each way) and for various errands. No diggity, no doubt.

This afternoon we drove about an hour outside of town. No problemo. When we started the car to leave the battery light kicked on. Shortly thereafter the navigation was off, additional dash alerts started coming on, and the power was clearly failing.

We pulled into an auto parts store to get the battery checked. The first thing the service rep did was tighten the connection on the negative terminal. The battery was checked and it had 11v. He said it looked like the battery wasn’t charging, most likely because the negative terminal wasn’t secure.

We got a battery pack on the battery and got the car to start. It still had a lot of loss of function of electrical, but it was running! After driving many feet, possibly some yards, we decided to hit another parts store for a second opinion and because the first parts store had a ‘system down’ situation so we couldn’t get a replacement battery even if we needed one.

During the 0.3 mile drive to the second parts store the electrical didn’t come back on and we noticed an odd smell. When we pulled in we popped the hood and noticed the coolant was starting to bubble over. No electrical meant the system wasn’t doing anything to prevent an overheat situation. We killed the power ASAP. Parts store #2 guy said that the battery was dead, probably the alternator. When he tested the battery it was at 11v and some voltage tester thing didn’t register a difference when it was turned on and off - leading the diagnosis of an alternator problem.

The battery is on the trickle charger at parts store #2. It’s going to be tested for how well it’s holding its charge.

The battery is from autumn of 2021. It’s probably due to get replaced. The alternator was replaced in the spring of 2023.

Any guesses if this is battery or alternator? Are there any tests to confirm which one it is?

As always, thank you!"

I have an 06 polo 9n(facelift) and recently the car won't start. I tested the battery and its reading 12.3 volts, then after a jump start it was reading 11v which apparently is an alternator issue
I charged the battery and popped it back in and still no start no sound from the engine or the car, I have electrics no issue, headlights, radio.etc but no crank.

I'm still on the fence on wether it's alternator or starter motor. Any advice?

2010 Honda Pilot - Timing Belt Issue, Possibly Needs a New Engine?
As the title says, I have a 2010 Honda Pilot with 223k miles. It's been a great car, but over the last 12 or 18 months it's begun showing it's age. Probably the biggest thing was an oil leak that was difficult to solve. Mechanic said it was needed a valve cover replacement, so we did that. Check engine light came on a couple of days later, he said it was just a random misfire, not to worry about it. Take it in for an oil change  a few weeks later (I go to a different place for my oil changes) and they tell me I have an oil leak. So I go back to my usual mechanic. He now thinks it's a solenoid. As tends to happen with him, it sits at his shop for four days with nothing but excuses. They couldn't get the part. They sent the wrong part. We have the part, but gosh, you need the vehicle to go out of town, and we're not 100% sure it's the solenoid, so let's inject some dye and you can come back later. 10-14 days would be perfect, then they'll REALLY be sure where that leak is coming from.

So I bring it back in and they tell me, yup, it's the solenoid and it needs to be replaced. I authorized the work and told him to do an oil change.  When picking it up he tells me, ""the timing belt is fine, but it's making a lot of noise. We lubed it up to quiet it down, but just keep an eye on it.""  I just sunk $1100 into the solenoid, so I wasn't about to spend another $1300 on this problem. This is early January.

The next day the check engine light comes on.  Go back and he tells me its a catalytic converter code but he thinks the catalytic converter is fine. Whatever.

However, a couple of weeks later my wife comments that the car seems noticeably louder than before - I thought it was just my imagination.  I usually have music on, so I honestly couldn't tell. It otherwise seems to be running like a top.

Anyway, I was thinking of booking an appointment with my favorite mechanic who is impossible to get into - it'll need an oil change by then and they can check out this noise. Before I can do that, however, it starts running pretty rough. I immediately drove it to the first mechanic (the one that replaced the solenoid).

He calls me after dropping it off, ""the reason it's running bad is that you haven't changed the oil and it's down two and a half quarts!"" I told him he was supposed to have changed the oil in January AND IT SHOULDN'T BE LEAKING OIL. As for the noise, he tells me that he thinks the tensioner is broken or bent and it's going to cost at least $950 just to diagnose it. I tell him to change the $%\*#ing oil and I'll be back for it.

So I took it to the mechanic on the other side of the parking lot. He tells me that the belt is fine, but yeah, it's off or something. But he also tells me that because it's an interference engine, it's possible that the engine is damaged beyond repair. And there is no way to know until you replace the timing belt. Sooooo....$1300 to replace/repair the belt and then possibly need a new engine ($6600). At least he didn't charge me for that piece of bad news.

FYI - it still runs, it just doesn't run very well.

So I'm posting here to ask the following:

1. Is it true that there is no way to know if the engine is damaged until you fix the timing belt? It sounds right to me based on what I've read, but I just want to double-check.
2. If the engine is damaged, is replacing the engine the only cost-effective option?

If the engine needs to be replaced (gambling on the timing belt seems like a bad idea), then I'm shopping for a new car. Is scrapping the car my only option?

tl;dr: Honda Pilot timing belt is off - is my car kaput?"

Garage ripped me off - any mechanics who can help?
My fiat 500 pop (2018) developed an issue with the speedo. The rest of the display worked totally fine, just the speedo gauge stopped working. It worked intermittently, some days fine, some days stuck at 0 for the full drive. Eventually it fully packed in and got stuck at about 15mph even when the engine was off. I asked at my usual garage and they said they could have a look at it but couldn’t fit me in for a while. I decided to take it to a “fiat specialist” (they listed themselves as that) thinking it would be a quick and easy repair, especially after doing some googling of my own and finding out this speedo issue is a known issue with fiat 500s. I called and let them know exactly what the problem was and they advised me to bring the vehicle in. I brought it in on a Wednesday morning and they said they’d call me once they’d had a look at it. They called me later that day and advised that the issue was with the instrument cluster and provided a quote of £150 + VAT for the 3 hours labour, and £200 for the instrument cluster to be sent to another company and repaired. I agreed to this thought I thought it did seem quite steep - instrument cluster repairs are listed online for around £180-£200 but the labour seemed quite extensive given that the issue seemed very clear to me, not sure if I’m incorrect on that though.

However, when the garage called to let me know the vehicle was ready to collect, they now provided a final price of £990. This is allegedly the “trade price” of the cluster repair, and charge for the labour. However, I can’t fathom how the quote jumped up from £350 + VAT to almost 1 THOUSAND pounds. They allegedly charge £150 an hour plus VAT for labour, and that’s where my “confusion” has come from, but if they had made this clear I would have never agreed to the repairs. The woman on the phone specifically said £150 for the 3 hours, I don’t know how that can be miscommunicated so poorly. There’d be an extra labour cost for them to refit the part after it was sent back, but surely not enough to justify the final cost. 

I suppose I just want to know whether any of this is reasonable or not? I have no choice but to pay it under protest as I need the car back, and to then dispute with my bank as well as going to the ombudsman/trading standards. I’ll be asking for the full price breakdown and having a proper review of the invoice. They also never provided a written quote at all, just over the phone. 

I am just gobsmacked at this price. Any mechanics on here who could help me out with what’s reasonable for this repair? "

2007 Honda Accord - Cranking Power Varies
Daily driver with 2-3 starts per day.  175k miles for reference.  Relay always engages solenoid, and the solenoid never disengages with the repeated clicking like a lower battery.

October 2023 - the car cranked slower than usual.  It was parked at the airport after a week of travel.  Monitored and the problem didn't repeat.

November 2023 - started car just fine, drove to nearby shop, and then it cranked slow when I left.  Checked battery terminals.  Clean and tight.   Took to O'Reilly and battery tested fine.  

December 2023 - made a long drive and then when I went to leave it cranked slow.  Considered alternator not charging.  Slow cranking after short drive would be an alternator but 2 hour drive without headlights should be plenty of time for charging.  At end of month it got cold and it would start fine.  One day it didn't and it took three attempts to start.  Let it set for a week and used another vehicle due to cold.

January 2023 - thought I would clean the snow off the car and check it.  Started just fine.  Resumed driving and it cannot notice any pattern to weather, drive duration, power usage (ie headlights), or other issue.  

Thoughts?"

Seeking advice re: constant repairs on my car
I am absolutely at my wit's end with my car right now. I got it two years ago and I still have two years remaining on the loan, and it's cost me nearly $8000 in repairs since last May. It's a Volkswagen Jetta from 2015 with 115,000 miles on it, which I know is by no means a new car, but my previous two cars (which were from 1999 and 2003 when they were replaced, and like 22 and 17 years old respectively, and also each had nearly 300,000 miles on them at the point of replacement) didn't have a fraction of the trouble that this one has had. 

In May, a pipe collapsed in my engine and collapsed onto the catalytic converter. Nearly $3k in repairs. In October, all four of my tires needed replacing, which cost a bit under $1000. In November, I needed a new battery, that ran me $400ish. Then in December, something was wrong with the fuel gage, and that cost $200. I fixed that and immediately went out of state with my family for a trip, leaving my car at home. In January, I got back and the second I started my car after not driving it basically at all since the last repair, and it shook violently when it was on and moving slower than like 40mph. I took it in and needed new spark plugs, new spark plug wiring, and all four fuel injectors needed replacing. $1200. I got it back and have had it for two weeks now and realized the emergency break doesn't work. Cool. Brought it in. Apparently the problem isn't just with the emergency break, but there's something wrong with all of the breaks, and it's now cost me $1800. 

I quite literally cannot afford to keep spending money on my car like this. Many of these charges have been more than I make in one paycheck. Every time something new happens I cry and have a crisis and ask myself what I have to do to make this stop. I don't live somewhere walkable so my only option is to put myself in debt trying to fix my car. I've had thousands of dollars on my credit card for months now and every paycheck for the past few weeks, I find myself trying to make $100 stretch across a week and a half. I've picked up extra jobs on top of my full time job to try to pay for this and it's still not enough. I bought at a terrible time to buy my car and pretty much could not find a good price anywhere. If I sell this now, I'll probably barely be able to pay off the rest of the loan, forget a down payment on a new car. I feel like selling isn't an option. 

But what on earth do I do? Have I bought a lemon? I tried to ask the mechanic who did the most recent repair for advice, and he says that between 100,000 miles and 125,000 is when a lot of cars need repairs like this and that while how close they've all been together is super bad luck for me, this isn't terribly far out of the range of normal. 

Can anyone else speak to that? This is the first car I've ever owned with less than 100,000 on it when I bought it. Is it a normal experience to need a TON of repairs between 100,000 and 125,000 miles? Should I try to sell it and just deal with the fact that I'll have to take out a massive loan for a new car? Should I suck it up and hope the light at the end of the tunnel is near?"

Could I DIY this?
Hello! I have a 2009 Prius with a misfiring engine (cylinder 4 according to the Autozone scan).

I got new spark plugs around Thanksgiving since that fixed it last year (the mechanic I trusted told me I might just have to change them more often). I declined the $150 diagnostic since it was the same symptoms. The mechanic I trusted no longer works there, and they charged me $350 just to replace the plugs (no new connections or anything else), which seems high. That fixed it for maybe 2 weeks, and the 2-3 broken buttons on my steering wheel even started working again! 

The issue is worst when the car has been parked for awhile, and it’s much more of a problem on really cold days. It significantly struggled the day I needed to get gas. I’ve been doing some research, and it seems like I might have a faulty coil. I’m a kindergarten teacher, so what I *don’t* have is more money for a mechanic. 

I watched a YouTube video and the repair looks manageable, but I have no experience with cars beyond changing filters and wipers. I’m fairly handy though and have taught myself how to switch out light/plumbing fixtures and other stuff around the house… could I do this? Or would I just be making new problems for myself?"

What could be the problem if it’s not a parasitic draw?
I have a 07 Honda Odyssey that dies every few days if I don’t drive it. It has a new alternator and new battery.
Someone suggested it might be my usb cigarette lighter charger so I pulled it out and the next day it died again.
Someone suggested it was a parasitic draw so I had a friend who knows about cars do the test, charged the car for a full day to do the test and he says The multimeter is reading .03 milliamp draw one specs are .05 or less. He says it’s not a parasitic draw and he’s stumped. 
I read its possible it could be a problem with the sliding door causing the issue. And that it’s a issue with Honda Odyssey minivans. Both doors are extremely hard to open.  Before I break down and just go to a mechanic Anyone have any suggestions??"

2013 Nissan Altima steaming/smoking under hood after radiator repair
So I noticed a coolant leak a couple weeks ago, and kept adding coolant and keeping a close eye on coolant level as well as my thermostat until I was able to take it to my mechanic. A couple times (always when I was idling for a few mins) I noticed steam coming from under the hood but the temp never changed. One of those times I even stopped by my mechanic’s panicking that I needed more coolant and he said, yeah you need to get that fixed but actually you still have some coolant in your reservoir right now. A quick google search told me it was probably just the coolant burning off of other hot parts under the hood that it was leaking onto, which is why it never overheated.

A couple times the thermostat fluctuated a little when the coolant got too low and I immediately pulled over and added more. It never went even close to the H end of the thermostat. 

I took it in to get fixed, by my regular guy that has always done good work and charged me reasonable prices. He said it was the radiator, and did the repair it cost $585 all said and done and that was 2 days ago. I’m gonna be honest I know nothing about cars and I didn’t ask if he was replacing it or what. He’s always done good work and I trust him. 

Problem is, today it steamed twice when idling. I hadn’t noticed this at all since the repair until today (2 days later) and the temp on the thermostat has been where it should be since getting the repair done. I’ll take it back to him Monday but in the meantime I’m HOPING maybe it’s just all the coolant that had leaked onto all the other stuff under the hood still burning off? I did go through probably 3 full containers of coolant in the last few weeks.

Is that what this probably is or was the repair done wrong? Just looking for advice until my mechanic’s shop is open again Monday. Thanks for anyone that can help"

2012 Camry se 121k miles. code p171
I have a reoccurring problem getting a p171 code, system too lean bank 1. Comes on during idle. 
I replaced the engine filter and evap purge valve. Came back on a month later. Added engine cleaner bottle during fill up. Check engine light went off by itself then came back on a week later. Replaced maf sensor, cleaned throttle body. Improved idle and smoother drive after but code came back on a month later. When check engine light is on, car is rough, eco light never turns on.  I manually erased the code and the car drives smooth and eco light comes on. Assume code will come back soon. 
Considering replacing fuel pump assembly but kinda pricey and invasive. Or cleaning the throttle body better and adding more engine cleaner to gas tank. 

I did take it into a shop and they wanted to charge $1000+ for inspection and clean of fuel system, throttle body service, top engine cleaner, fuel treatment, technician road test

Any suggestions?

Edit: got p171, p455, p441 pop up. took it to another shop and they found out the evap canister was broken. They replaced it, no problems a week later. "

Did I get taken advantage of at this local car shop?
I brought my car into a local body shop because I noticed smoke coming from my back tire. After their inspection, I was told that the issue was due to the need for several new parts, and they charged me over $600 for the repair and I was satisfied with the work and timeframe of the shop. However, a little over one month later after the repair that supposedly fixed my issue, I noticed smoke coming from the same tire.

I immediately took it back to the shop. They acknowledged the oversight and assured me they would take care of the issue, which had caused significant damage. I was told it would be complex fix but we discussed the price range multiple times, once even being the day before my car was ready and I emphasized my concerns of staying within a certain budget they seemed more then fine with that. I asked that they notify me before proceeding with any additional work that might result in extra charges if that was needed.

However, when I finally received my car back after three weeks, I was handed a bill more then double the initial price we had discussed multiple times. They explained that they had to replace the entire axle, which they had not to communicated to me prior to doing this when I had asked multiple times for them to do. They also did tell me when I had spoken to them the day before then they knew they had to replace it because they said when I picked it up it took so long because they had to order the new Axle?? They also did not honor the discount they had promised for missing the initial problem causing more cost in damage to my car.

I’m worried I was taken advantage of but this is my first time dealing with a car issue of this extent so I’m just unsure is this is normal. they promised a certain price, didn’t communicate with me what the issues were and missed the initial issue causing more damage then charged me full price for work that was possibly a result of their initial oversight. Costing me nearly two thousand dollars in repairs…. I also am worried that there is further damage to the car is this something I should be concerned about?"

2008 Ford Fusion - Battery and Smart Junction Box
Hi there, I've had recent problems with the car draining the battery within 48 hours.  In the spring the mechanic replaced the battery and worked on the alternator.  Unfortunately this didn't seem to work, and we then eventually replaced the smart junction box, which required a lot of work to explore repair options, and to find a part from a wrecker.

I'm no expert on car electrical, but the 96R battery charge levels are not inspiring confidence - and I'm looking for guidance on levels.  The mechanic claimed to have fully charged it on thursday, it sat on their lot until saturday when I picked it up.  Took it home and the battery read 12.3v.  I then fully charged it to 13.2v.  Within 7 hours, it was back around 12.55v, and this morning it's reading 12.28v.  This leaves me wondering if the underlying electrical issues have been fixed with my car, as would this not be a low charge?  Am I thinking about this right, or can someone else guide my thinking on this topic.  Also, for awareness, at what charge level will the car not start, I want to know for my own sake, as I will not likely top this up, as I want to monitor it's charge levels.

Thanks"

Need Help ASAP…
I have a brake problem. Now it can be something simple as just changing the brakes but just incase it’s something else I thought I’ll come to Reddit and ask. I searched it up on Google and of course it’s saying change your brakes. 

Before you continue reading, stop right here and answer this question. How do you know your brakes is out? 

When your brakes is out does the brake peddle keep pushing down slowly? When I brake and I’m at a stand still my brake pedal keep pushing down further then it’s ever have before. Yes I also have to push down further when I’m trying to brake. 

The weird part is I was driving earlier just find, parked, went in the store and came out within maybe 10 minutes, came out, started the car and put it in reverse. Now I like to put my music on before I start going, so I’m sitting in reverse with my foot on the brake trying to get my music on. As I’m sitting there I feel my foot slowly going down and down. Lowkey got scared. Drove back home so slow.

Now I don’t want to change the brake pads and it be something more, my mom said maybe something bust but I feel like if a line bust or something I wouldn’t be able to stop like at all. Any bit of knowledge helps greatly. Trying to see if I can fix this myself before I take it to a mechanic and they charge me an arm and a leg for labor."

Battery issues
I'm having problems with my car battery. The vehicle is a 2009 Mazda MPV 

The battery went flat when I left the electronics on by mistake for maybe around 3-4 hours I tried switching the car on but the battery was dead. ( All the electronics where on but after a while of trying to start the car began to flicker and the radio turned off).

I found someone to jump start the car and it started. I drove home imediatly after the car had been jump started for maybe about five minutes. I don't think it was enough time for the battery to charge up. The next day the battery was flat again and so I got another jump start. This time I kept the car on and drove for around give or take 24-30 minutes. I got home and switched the car off and immediately switched it on again. I let it sit for around 30 minutes and tried switching it on again but the car wouldn't start. (Again all the electronics where on).

I got a friend's 4amp battery charger and charged the battery for about 8 - 10 hours. I constantly monitored the battery but the guage didn't move at all. I used my multimeter to check the voltage this morning and it was around 12.86V and 12.70V when it was off the charger, (I checked multiple times), before I put it in the car. The green light on the battery was on. I tried switching the car on but it did not start. And, the light went clear. All the electronics turned on.

When I plugged the battery to the charger the reading is at around 12.88V and 12.35V when I disconnect the battery charger and read the battery by itself it is somewhere in the high 10V range. The gauge on the battery charger goes up to full or halfay when you first place the battery on the charger but then drops. I don't know what the problem is anymore. 

I don't think it's the alternator because the battery light on the vehicle doesn't come on while driving and the belt looks fine. 

Please help me out"

Lanham Ford shady practices
I own a 2012 Ford Focus. Got a letter from Ford saying that if I experienced “intermittent disengagement of the transmission” that it was a Transmission Control Module issue, and they had a program to give owners the option of coming in before June 30 and we’d get a new TCM. This car has always lurched when you hit the accelerator; my husband quit driving it for that reason. Yippee, I thought, we can get this fixed. Called the nearest Ford dealer, DARCARS Lanham Ford, they verified the program code, and I made an appt to bring it in. Only THEN did they tell me that “if we find there’s nothing wrong with the transmission there will be a $300 diagnostic fee.” Hold up, I said, nobody mentioned that. “Well we’re telling you now.” I almost drove the car home….but decided the letter described my problem do perfectly it HAD to be the transmission. So I left it. Two days later, I get a call: There’s nothing wrong with my car and you owe us $300. I insist on making them test drive it with me. The service dept guy says he feels the hesitation but “that’s just the way this car is made.” Says even though it’s an automatic, it has a clutch “and that’s just the computer communicating with the clutch.” Which sounds like a TCM problem to me, but what do I know. I say, “I’m willing to pay the technician for his time but I can’t believe you guys spent more than an hour on this and $300 is excessive.” He says, “$300 IS our hourly fee. It’s competitive with all the other dealerships.”

NOT TRUE, I discovered when I got home. I called five area Ford dealers; they all charge between $150 and $185 an hour for diagnostic labor, so Lanham Ford is charging 50 percent more than everybody else.

I file a review with the Better Business Bureau. Get a reply from Lanham Ford saying they are sorry I’m unhappy, but their charge is $250 an hour, and “happy travels!”

That last part was what made me elevate from “pissed” to “white hot rage.” And at this point even THEY are admitting they overcharged me (though not by as much as I maintain I was overcharged). I have called the general manager, Sam Darvish, who said he’d get back to me. That was yesterday. Today, no hear.

I am LIVID.

$300 down the shitter and the car still lurches. But mainly I want a refund. Even a partial refund I’d settle for. I am an older lady and I feel dissed and scammed and I am at my wit’s end. They charged me an outrageous amount of money to do nada. Any ideas on next steps?"

I'm being forced to take my 2005 SL500 to an official dealership for a part replacement that needs specific security coding. What's the best way to approach their employees to not be hustled?
My area is kinda surrounded on all sides by shady Mercedes service centers who like to add on unneeded repairs and services to your specific needs, and I'm not sure how I should approach them to get what I only need worked on. I have a faulty EIS  (electronic ignition switch) that my mechanic can't repair/replace because it requires Mercedes security coding, and I'm sure my local dealership service centers are gonna say I need to replace my brakes or taillights - or something *additionally* not needed - as well (all four dealerships have tried to do this to me at different times before - warranty sensotronic brake system needs replacement? You need new pads because they're bare even though your mechanic already replaced them 5 months prior and showed you that they're still meaty, etc).

So far, I've made an appointment over the phone with Mercedes to bring the car in. But I think I only talked to a phone rep and not to an actual technician: 

\-Does anyone know if I can specifically ask to speak to a service tech when I get there? Or is the phone person the only one I need talk to? Do I need to speak to a service tech at all? 

\-And since I know exactly what part I need replaced, do I need to demand in writing that they only work on that part? I'm afraid they're gonna try to do some diagnostic service on top of my request and will try to charge me for something I don't need. But mostly I know the EIS isn't coding as an error, and I'm really afraid that Merc will try to do a diag first, won't see an error, and are gonna try to charge me for a diagnosis while refusing to do the part replacement entirely. 

\-My other worry is that all of my local dealerships give older cars to their newer mechanics to work and practice on while the more seasoned ""pro's"" repair the newer stuff that's still under warranty (this actually created a problem for me with another older Merc I owned a couple years ago that I had to bring in, so it's not rumor or superstition on my part).  

I really am stuck having to use a dealership for this specific repair, and I'm just looking for advice on what I should do from any car enthusiasts here. Thanks much."

Need help. A/C blowing hot air even after 20 minutes
How can I get cooling air from my car A/C? I took the car a month ago to a mechanic for A/C diagnostics. They charged $99 and said there is a problem and I need to pay $1200 to get it really working. I did and it blew cool air for a week or two when I drove it during the middle of the day.

However, today, when I drive the car for about twenty minutes, no cooling effect is happening. Then, a little bit of cool air comes out for about 10 minutes or so. Anytime, I slow down or stop the car, it gets hotter inside the car. And, another twenty minutes down the road, A/C literally blows me hot air. The temperature feels even hotter than the outside air.  Shouldn't I have gotten a new A/c for that price of $1200? I am not sure what is happening here. I would appreciate your comments and suggestions. Any advice?

I am thinking of taking the car now to the Walmart in my town so they can check and give me a correct diagnosis."

-Charging ok
-Instrument panel ok
-Fixed faulty wiring ok

The remaining culprit:
-Power drainage from fuse 107 - Instrument cluster battery supply, on-board diagnosis 


Fast forward to today, my steering power malfunctioned and the shop read following codes:

U261B Improper Program Termination of steering help and functioning

A/C acting weird
Hi everyone,
I have a 2014 GMC Terrain.
In last few months I started having this weird phenomenon. When I put the A/C to max cold, ot pushes out really hot air (which also stinks). Any other location on the dial blows out cold air (sometimes colder, sometimes not so cold, and sometimes even hot air).
I charged the A/C, and replaced the filters, but nothing changed.

PDF file with Format and Images
I’m having so much fun. But I don’t give up. I have a Chevrolet 2013 Silverado 1500 ½ ton pickup truck. 
It had 192K Miles on it when I had an AFM lifter 
collapse on Cylinder 4. It is an LC9 motor.
I Rebuilt the top side of the motor with new parts 
including an AFM/DOD delete with Parts from Texas 
Speed Performance. They are great. Good after 
purchase support. I put a Stage 2 CAM in it. This 
VIDEO shows how it was running. I have since 
treated with Marvel Mystery Oil and the lifter noise 
has minimised.
So as everyone knows that when you do a DoD delete you 
supposed to get it tuned so that it doesn’t put your truck 
in “limp mode” when the Valley Pan Actuators are not 
plugged in but some of us are economically challenged 
and still have to get to work. So short of Getting a tune I 
pugged the valley pan back in, suspended nicely and it 
was running Dreamy for 2 months. Lots of power. 
Plugging the valley pan back in trick’s the ECM into 
thinking it can still “actuate” the cylinder deactivation for 
AFM. Stage 2 CAM worked great with out changing the 
torque converter. Block is well grounded. Spraying 
starting fluid into throttle body does not help. This video
shows that on Cylinder 1 there is 150psi of compression 
and spark. The Engine Block seems to have relatively low 
resistance to the negative batter terminal. There doesn’t
seem to be any vacuum leaks.
Installed NEW fuel injectors, ignition coil packs, spark 
plugs and wires. New oil pressure sensor. As I was saying 
it was running sweet for 2 months.
After 45 minutes of HW driving it went into “limp mode.” Reduced Engine power. Crawling along the 
side of the HW.
I unplugged and re-plugged the Valley pan Actuator circuit and the 
truck started right up with regular power like the awesome two 
months prior. I was on the way to a well paying job so I decided to 
keep going forward. 
I had to repeat this procedure 3 times on the way to the job. It 
worked for a period of time between 10-20 minutes each and then 
went back “Engine power Reduced.” It did it several times on the 
way home until when we were 40 miles from home It was shifting up 
and down rapidly and the engine was vibrating abnormally like 
cylinders were misfiring and then when we pulled over I was unable 
to start It. Even though There was plenty of oil pressure Road Side I 
checked the oil and there was none on the dip stick so I assumed I 
had run it out of oil. It didn’t overheat. When AAA got us back to my

Trouble Codes
• P0010 – I did a VVT delete when I did the DoD delete. This is the VVT actuator signal connector 
that is dangling and likely corroded from our lovely Vermont winter. But The Motor/Truck has 
been running strong with this code for 2 months.
• P3400 - I believe this code was telling me that the actuators on the valley pan are shitting the 
bed. Open circuit. The ones that haven’t died I measured at about 12ohms. 2 of the 4 have 
failed so far. I plan to substitute some resistors here to trick the motor.
• P0420 – This on was new the day the truck died. 
• P0106 – This one came on about a month ago? –
Replacement MAP on order
• P0101 – MAF - Maybe this my problem – Replacement 
on Order
• P0068 – This one came on the day the truck died. From 
what I’ve been able to tell it has something to do with 
the TPS. I can get it up to 84%. I can hear it actuating 
when I press the accelerator with out starting it. –
Bought Replacement.
• P0452 - This is the Usual code we all ignore when the 
dumb-ass thing breaks. It being broke doesn’t stop the 
engine from running.
• P0420 – I don’t know much about this one. - Emissions
• P3441 - That’s ones on there now. It has to do with 
they valley pan actuator circuit is is opening up.
Parts on order
• Manifold Pressure Sensor
• Mass Air Flow Sensor
• Throttle Position Sensor
• Spark Detector
• Noid Light to Test Injector signal
Could it be a Cam Sensor? A Crank Sensor? There are no codes for those."

Frustrated beyond belief- Kia Sorento not starting
I have a 2017 Sorento that has an issue with not starting that NOBODY can figure out. Timeline: 

September 2022- car wouldn’t start- dash lights come on but engine doesn’t try to turn over. towed to dealership who replaced the battery

November 2022- car began this delay start where it wouldn’t turn over immediately but would within a second or 2 delay- but mostly started normal. Until it didn’t start at all and couldn’t be jumped for 3 days straight. Towed to dealership who told me it started just fine for them, kept it for 2 weeks and couldn’t repeat the problem so made me take it back. 

March 2023- car wouldn’t start when I left work. Somehow I got it to start with my remote starter after about 3 tries. Then within a couple days nothing would make it start at all and it couldn’t be jumped. Towed to a different dealership this time who told me it started after they charged the battery and that they can’t replicate the problem and made me come get it. 
Literally the next day my car wouldn’t start. Somehow after trying the other key fob it started that time. And now the day after (today) it’s not starting with either key fob or with remote start. 

I don’t even know what to do at this point. Clearly to me the issue has to have something to do with the car either not reading the fob correctly or a computer/wiring issue. Something signal, wire, or programming somehow. But the dealerships only care about the battery. If it was a battery issue and it was dying then it shouldn’t start sometimes with different methods like remote vs push button and it should be able to be jumped when it’s dead which it can’t be, right? 
I wish there was an option to manually put a key in an ignition when this happens because I have a strong feeling it would start if I could test that theory out. 
Is there no way possible for the dealership to test anything other than battery, starter, alternator issues (which are all normal)?"

Manual transmission issue
I have a 2009 Honda Civic SI with manual transmission. When shifting into 4th gear there is grinding even with the clutch disengaged. If I let the RPMs drop to idle I can shift into 4th without grinding. It also happens when shifting to reverse but only when the revs are up. When in neutral with the clutch engaged the shifter is prevented from going into any gear, except 4th gear.

Anyone know what the problem is? Is it something I could fix on my own with the right tools? Any idea what a repair shop would charge? Would a new transmission be cheaper/better?"

Charge warning light (battery? alternator? or something else?)
I have a 2009 Pontiac Vibe/Toyota Matrix, 2.4 L and my charge warning light came up on the first time. 

I checked my battery's voltage with car off, 12.4 V. My wife has a 2006 Matrix and her battery's voltage is also 12.4 V. (Haynes manual says it should be at least 12.6 V. Whatever)

However, when I start my car, I only read 11.7 V across the battery. On the other Matrix, it is 13.5V. Haynes says it should be between 13.5 to 14.5 V.

Since I had another car, I did the following test: with both cars running, connected their batteries together. When I do this, the voltage reads 12.7 V. I left this for around 5 mins but the charge warning light didn't go off. The belt looks like and I checked the cables visually.

What do y'all think the problem is? A new battery? A new alternator/voltage regulator? Or something else?"

Airbag sensor question for 2009 Corolla
Hello everyone,

I am looking for advice as my trip to the dealer and my inquiries with Toyota Canada (through their website) seem to go nowhere. For context, I live in Eastern Canada.

Car is a 2009 Corolla CE, manual transmission, with about 80k (kms, I know, I don't drive much lol). The car is in good condition given its age, and I am the first and sole driver of the car.

Back in August 2022, the airbag light went on. My local Canadian Tire where I usually get the tires changed in spring/fall said they won't touch it and it requires a trip to the dealer. Fair enough, off I go. Dealer keeps my car for an entire day, charges me $300 CDN and since I needed the car the next day, basically tells me it's an airbag sensor that needs to be replaced. Report says part # is   
 8917309510. Proceeds to tell me that changing it will be another $300 or so. Problem is that the part is backordered and they have no idea when it'll be available. The conversation ends with him telling me to call Toyota Canada and ask about it (weird, I thought that was part of their job but whatever...).

Fast forward through about 1.5 months of back and forth with Toyota Canada. Initial contact via their website. Took 2 weeks to get an answer asking for a bunch of info, which I provided on the same day. 10 days later nothing, I email back. A week later they tell me they need me to re-send all the info. Which I promptly did. No news. Contacted them 1 week later. Still waiting now for 8 days to hear from them.

From what I can see online, there is a website (not sure I can name it) where you can buy parts for Toyota in Canada. Part is about $115. I was wondering if it'd be worth buying it online and then asking the dealer to install it, or if I need to have the part sourced from Toyota themselves.

Given that it's an important piece, I want to know what you guys think about sourcing it online vs from the maker. If it were a lightbulb I wouldn't think twice but I am a bit wary of something sensitive like this. On the other hand, I would like to know that my airbag works as it should lol.

Thanks in advance!"

Car won't start after days with new battery
Got in my car (2013 Toyota Corolla) Friday last week (2/3) and my battery was dead (power but only clicking sounds when attempting to start). Got a jump and had it tested at AutoZone. Replaced the battery, no issues turning over. Drove around all weekend (roughly 200 mi give or take), no issues. I even drove it to the store Monday morning.

Got in my car Monday night to go to the gym, I get power but no sound at all. I bought a jump box and a multimeter (need one anyway).

* Before the jump the battery was at 12.37 volts. 
* I jump the car, removed the jumper, and the batter read at 14.7 volts. 
* Turned the car off, battery at 12.7. 
* Attempted to start, didn't turn over (one short click), battery at 12.43 volts.

It seems like the alternator is charging the battery. Maybe the starter, start solenoid, just happened to get a bad battery? Any other tests I could/should run or does it seem pretty obvious what the problem is?"

Dash lights, Gas Gauge, and Speedometer won't work when engine started.
I have a 2014 Town and Country that seems to be having a pretty severe issue. It started a few days ago while driving. Whenever I would come to a stop, my entire dash would flash on and off, but would stabilize when I was driving again.

I didn't drive again until yesterday, and it seems to problem has gotten much worse. When I start the car, everything works fine. But as soon as I fully turn the engine on, the entire dash goes black and my interior lights stop working. However, my entertainment system and the backlights on the a/c control panel are still on. At this point, gauges and speedometer still read, but as soon as I break, that gets stuck at whatever speed it was at. I'm not car literate at all, but I did check the fuses and they seem okay. The interior lights and some of the dash are on one fuse and the rest of the dash is on another set, but both seemed fine.

I did turn the engine on and then to start several times, and only once did the warning lights come on. The check engine and the electronic throttle control light showed up, but disappeared after about 30 seconds.  I have no idea if that is the issue or if whatever is causing the issue, caused that light to malfunction too.

I don't plan on fixing the issue myself, but I would like some ideas of what could be wrong before I get my car towed to a shop. I've had some bad mechanic experiences, and would love a general idea of what could be wrong, before they charge me for 3 separate things before finally correcting the right thing.

If anyone has any ideas what it could be, I would be super grateful. With the price of everything being sky high at the moment, I just don't have the cash for them to mess around and replace everything, and would love to be able to get it fixed ASAP.

I think i broke my Husbands car...
I borrowed my husband's 2008 Dodge Caliber to help my grandmother move a trunk. There was a crazy driver who almost hit me and I swerved to avoid an accident but the corner of the trunk caught the back windshield and shattered it. We got a repairman to come out later that day who replaced the rear windshield. I thought everything was fine. Later in the week, we went out to get groceries and his battery was dead. I took it to AutoZone to see if it could be charged. And it could! Later that week same problem. I took it to AutoZone and They tried to charge it and said It wouldn't charge. So I bought a new battery.  Again it lasted a week. I was wondering if replacing the back windshield may be something that was wired wrong and keeping a light on even though it's not hooked up or something like that. I know now we don't have the back windshield wiper that use to be on the car (didn't notice as we never used it) Trying to get an idea of what is wrong so I know what to look for or seek help from a mechanic."

Am I being scammed?
Hello. My 2019 Hyundai Accent is at the dealership and I suspect they're trying to fleece me, but I don't know enough about cars to be sure.

It started while I was visiting my mom. I took her and my niece out to dinner and when we got out of the car we smelled something like a cross between gasoline and burning rubber. When we got out of the restaurant my lights turned on and you could here the car trying to start, but it just wouldn't. 

I had it towed to a trusted mechanic and he said that it looked like the fuel injectors. He could fix it, but it would be expensive, and the problem should be under warranty. I had it towed to the dealership instead on his suggestion. 

The dealership guy called and he said the real problem was with the fuel pump, and it’s being fixed under warranty. Great!

Here's where I'm iffy though. The guy said that while the repair is under warranty, I have some basic maintenance they could take care of while it's there for around $500. This includes an oil change (it was due), new transmission fluid, a piston cleaning, and a new air cabin filter. My question is, if the pump was failing, didn't they have to replace those fluids anyway? Are they trying to charge me for something that should be under warranty?"

06 Honda CRV repair - crank no start - I’m out of ideas!
Hey folks. Need some help on my wife’s car. Really out of ideas here, as I am not the most knowledgeable with cars… unfortunately I also don’t make the dough to have a mechanic charge me out of the wazoo. So trying my best to DIY as much a possible.

Here’s the rundown: 
06 Honda CRV 2.4L tvech engine. 

•Engine has always ran pretty decent. At times it would do a weird “jolt” thing while driving& all of the dash lights would then come on. But Noticed that mostly happened when engine was low on oil. 🤷🏽‍♂️
•the past 3-6 months it has intermittently taken a bit more time to start, as if starter was going out or something, however it always ended up staring and running ok.


Came back from a week out of town and now the car will not start. It will crank & crank no problem, but will not start! Battery shows a strong 12.6v, fuses seem fine, relays are clicking, I can hear the fuel pump hum when I put key in & fuel is getting to engine fine. Got a camshaft sensor code so I switched that out… still just cranking. No start. No idea what to do next…

Any ideas? What should I do next?spark plugs? Charge battery even though shows full? Im at a brick wall!"

A/C issue on 2011 Altima - help?
The A/C on my car suddenly quit this week. It was working fine last week. I took it to a local garage and he checked the fuses, checked for leaking, and checked the freon and it was fine. He suggested the problem might be the controller (?) in the dash. He suggested a dealer and could not fix it there.

Dealers want to charge $200 - $300 to diagnose the problem, before any parts and labor. It's a 2011, so I'm really hoping to avoid spending close to $1000 to get my air working again. 

Any ideas? Anything else I can check? Is there a magic ""reset button"" somewhere 🤔 please?
Any help greatly appreciated! It has 107,000 miles if that makes any difference."

2014 Kia Soul alternator? Battery?
My car has 162,000 miles for reference.

So the other day I was sitting in my car (with it running), doing some work as I usually do.  Time got away from me, and when it was time to drive off, I noticed my battery light was on, but the car was driving fine. The next day I hop in the car and the battery light is flashing occasionally.  I drove straight to the place where I bought the battery (in Feb.) to get it tested , they say the battery is fine.  Just drive around and let it charge up.

The next day, I head onto the highway and as I am nearing my destination, every single light on the dash turns on. I get off on my exit and the power steering becomes difficult to operate. I pull over, turn the car off, and it won’t come back on. It can be jumped, but won’t hold power long.

I get it towed to the shop, $1200 later I have a new battery and alternator.  Ok, fine.  The next day, I am sitting in my car eating and after a while, everything on the dash is lighting again. Turned car off, it won’t cut back on. Get it towed back to the shop, they said a “relay misfired” and they fixed that for free. The next day, I was sitting in my car working again and after a good while, the car light up again.  I cut it off for a while, called my bf. The car magically cuts back on and he drives it home no problem.  He said the oil light came on. So we put some more oil in.

I mechanic friend of his was supposed to look at it, but it’s taking a while.  Meanwhile, I have a rental until Saturday.  I made an appointment for Friday at a shop, but it’s $96 Just for diagnostics.  The common denominator seems to be me sitting the car for long periods of time with it running. Any insight?"

Control arms need replacement, or just dirty?
Hello,

I have a 2012 honda civic with 55k miles. My dealership (who always tries to offer overpriced and sometimes unnecessary service) says the control arms are too old. Do they look legitimately unstable, or just rusted on the surface?

It's hard to take their word for anything, considering they try to charge 115$ to replace an air filter. I get my oil changed there, as they offer discounts which I think they use as a loss leader to get people trapped into other services.

&#x200B;

Also, I haven't noticed any problems with the steering, or any of the other signs associated with bad control arms.

2014 Ford Escape titanium “engine fault” message but no check engine light and no recorded error codes. Help?
So, basically what it says on the title. After starting the engine, exactly one minute in I get the message that says: Engine Fault Service Now.

The car runs as normal. Check engine light never comes on. I’ve connected my OBD II reader and I get no error messages at all. 

Has anyone else ever had this kind of problem, or have an easy solution that doesn’t require going to a mechanic to fix it? 



A little more story: In January I did have the car overheat. I took it to the dealership and they charged a lot to repair the cooling system. After I finally got my car back, I tried to get it inspected but because they also replaced the battery they told me that the inspection could not be completed, and I’d have to drive it around a bit to get all the emissions systems to record new data. 

I’ve driven it further than the 100 miles they told me to drive... and then the error message started showing up. Due to several catastrophes (Texas freeze, and an idiot in a Lyft paying zero attention and opening their passenger door while I passed, knocking my rear view mirror off!) I have been unable to attempt another inspection.  

That is one thing the obd reader reports: evaporator system monitor, oxygen sensor monitor, and oxygen sensor heater are showing as incomplete on the i/m readiness page. Any advice?"

Mechanic misdiagnosed problem, should I have to re-pay if charged?
So a little back story, I bought a 2014 Honda Accord about 2 months ago from this car dealership and put $2000 down. Now for the past couple weeks the car has been making a chirping sound. Originally thought it was a belt because the sound was happening even when the car was in idle, so I took it to a quick lube place that replaces belts and had them look at it. However, they said that it’s the alternator and was going to be over $900. 
When I got the car from this dealership, I got a warranty with it so I called them and asked to bring it in for a second opinion. 
The guy I was talking to at the dealership, in the service department told me he didn’t think it was the alternator because of the year/ make/ model of the vehicle.
When I brought it in to the dealership and they looked at it, they ended saying it was actually the alternator and it was going “out”.of course the warranty I got with the vehicle doesn’t cover the alternator, go figure 🙄
So I had to shovel out almost $800 & afterwards while driving it home, the CHIRPING SOUND was still there!! 
So I brought it back to the dealership and currently waiting to see what it actually is. 
If they try to re-charge me should I fight it? What if the alternator wasn’t even bad and they just went off what I said the lube shop told me. 
Please help, I’m a poor college student"

Can auto shops charge me a fee if I ask for my old parts back?
I had to get the pump on my power steering replaced because it was failing. I took it to one mechanic who  fixed it and everything was fine. 2 years later it started failing again! I took it to another mechanic who said the previous mechanic used a cheap pump that failed. They said they could replace it with a dealer-recommended pump and I told them to go ahead. 

I asked if I could keep the old pump as evidence in case I had a chance of taking legal action against the last sleezy mechanics. The current mechanic said I could have them back, but I had to pay a $70 something recycling fee or something. I declined, but they allowed me to take pictures of all the old parts as evidence. 

It didn't dawn on me until later though... why would they need to charge me a fee so I can have the parts I already own back? I know they need to be recycled and there are fees with that, but wouldn't that be my problem and not theirs? Would I need to pay that fee if I told them to recycle the parts for me, not the other way around?"

Truck fixed itself? Bizarre situation I cannot comprehend.
Before I start, this is going to be a little lengthy post as I want to provide as many specifics as I can and hope I can get this answered.

Anyhow, May of 2019 I moved to a new base (Military) knowing I would be deploying 2 months later. My current daily vehicle was falling apart and I wanted to get a daily truck instead. I went out and bought a cheap, 2006 Nissan Frontier 4.0 v6 and drove it around until I deployed in July.

I left my truck on base and a friend took care of it by driving it around occasionally to make sure the fluids would run and the tires did not rot. January time frame I find out he took the truck in due to a SES light and had the Bank 1 Catalytic Converter and O2 sensor replaced. Great. I return from my deployment in February and do a tune up with new tires, air filter, oil change, spark plugs, etc. I took my 2 weeks of R&R and drove back home where my folks live. While home another SES lights up so I take it in to Nissan. Turns out to be the bank 2 Catalytic Converter and O2 sensor so I get those replaced. I leave the dealership and shortly after another SES light comes on. At this point I was about ready to head back to my base so I left the truck with my folks and drove back my other vehicle that was there originally. A few weeks later my dad took the truck to Nissan to see what the problem was and it turns out the Bank 1 side was replaced with after market parts and they said there was a leak due to the after market Cat not aligning properly. I told him to not worry about it and that I will get my truck later as it has a 1 year warranty on the work where it was done.

My dad continued to drive the truck occasionally just to keep it running, despite the SES light. Then he kept having issues with the battery not keeping a charge. He went to jump it and accidentally crossed the wires and fried the BCM. Takes it in to Nissan to get it fixed and gets it back with no SES light on.  I return home for July 4th weekend and get my truck and drive it back to home. A few miles outside the city, SES light comes on. I took my truck to Autozone to read the codes and it comes back with Bank 1 O2 sensor again. I had to drive the truck, until today (September 8th), before bringing the truck in due to COVID and work. They tell me they have no idea whats going on, there is no SES light on and there is no history at all on the truck. I told them I did not mean to be rude or condescending but asked if they checked the right truck as the SES light was on since I got back in July and never went off. He assured he did so I went to pick up my truck. There was no SES light, truck ran perfectly and I could not hear any exhaust leak.

Now I am scratching my head trying to figure out how in the world this is possible. Did they mess up and not originally plug the O2 sensor in and did not want to admit it? I do not think so, because I think that would throw a code immediately. Is there is a wiring issue from the BCM that was so simple they just plugged something in and did not want to embarrass me? I am completely dumbfounded by this. Any ideas on what it could be/is?

\*\*Edit: The entire time the SES code for the Bank 1 side was on I would get awful gas mileage, hardly any power in the higher RPM range and the smell of gas after driving. I thought it was the fuel filter so I cleaned the entire system but the same issues persisted."

2000 Silverado Battery light on
2000 Silverado, 5.3 V8, auto 2WD.  141k miles.

Battery light is on (left side message center).  Battery is new, alternator has been tested and is working fine.  Vehicle is charging normally, sits at 14 volts while running.

&#x200B;

HVAC is unresponsive and won't light up, and the PRND lights above the column do not light up when the vehicle is running (but do light up when you turn the key on or off).

&#x200B;

Tried moving the grounds around near the alternator and tightening them up, and I've also checked all the fuses related to HVAC.  Not sure what to check next, googling the problem results in 100,000 answers of telling me to check the battery and alternator so finding a solution has been difficult.

&#x200B;

UPDATE:

I did some more troubleshooting, and I have 4 fuses on the secondary (in cab) fuse block that aren't getting power.  All the top left fuses (cruise, AC, 4WD etc) aren't getting power.  I checked the grounds (under driver, both sides below the windshield wipers, and the one near the front frame horn) and I've checked for cut wires all around the area.  All the fuses in both fuse blocks are putting out 12v except those 4.

&#x200B;

My temp and fuel gauge are not working, and the transmission display lights (PRND) only work in the ACC position, not with the key forward."

Subaru Impreza 2013 battery repair/60k mile maintenance question
I bought a used Subaru Impreza with 50k miles on it almost exactly one year ago. My first ever car. The other day I tried to start it and it wouldn’t turn on, so I had a friend jump it and that worked to get me home. Drove it around for about an hour hoping that’d charge the battery, but the next day I had the same problem and couldn’t get it to start. it’s currently sitting in my garage as I flew back to my hometown for about a month the day this second time happened. 

Sounds to me like the battery is dead (there was some corrosion around it when I first jumped it). I’m also at 60k miles now, so I want to take it in to a) get the battery replaced and b) do a full service since I’m about at the time this needs done I think. 

I’ve never owned a car so this is all new to me, but do those two points above make sense based on what I’ve explained? If so, about how much can I expect this to set me back? I bought it used from CarMax, but will most likely be taking it to a Subaru dealership by me to repair, unless anyone here would recommend otherwise.

Sorry for the newbie questions, I love the car and want to make sure I take care of it so I can have it for a long time. Thanks in advance!"

Subaru Tribeca air conditioning problem
Hi everyone! I have a 2009 Subaru Tribeca with some AC trouble. I first started having trouble with the AC 2 summers ago where on 1 or 2 occasions on very hot days, the AC would turn off partway into my drive and not turn back on no matter what I did. It was just a few isolated incidences so I ignored it. Then, last summer, it just stopped working on a very hot day so I brought it into a nearby mechanic who said they did AC repairs; I was unfamiliar with mechanics in the area so I went based off of websites. They tested the AC (not entirely sure what they did or didn't do) and said that they fixed it. They charged just under $200 and the AC worked for about 5 minutes and then shut off. I called them, took my car back in, and they said my relay plug was loose. They then re-lubricated the blue plug and pushed it back in. The AC then worked for the rest of the summer. Now that it is warm out again, I have been trying to use my AC. On the days I really need it (the hottest days), the AC works for 1-5 minutes at the beginning of my drive and then warm air starts blowing. On cooler days, the AC will last much longer. Yesterday it was around 65 degrees F out and the AC stayed on for my entire 20 minute drive. I took my car to a mechanic near home that I have been to many times a few days ago and they ran some tests- they said that they checked for leaks (none) and then checked the electrical signal (normal) and that the compressor must be the problem. They are currently waiting on a new compressor. My question is: is it definitely the compressor? If it were the compressor, why does my AC function just fine on cooler days? Are we sure it isn't a problem with the relay like it was last summer?

Thanks so much in advance!"

2003 Mazda Protege5 2.0L M/T Charging System Issue...Please help!
I've been scouring the web for an answer to my problem, but haven't found a solution yet, so I thought I would finally make an account ask Reddit. This is my first post (hopefully I'm doing it right).

I have a 2003 Mazda Protege5 2.0L M/T and had an alternator short itself to out (either due to old age or a failing oil pan gasket <since fixed> which was leaking oil onto it and everything around). During quarantine I have done a ton of work on her including installation of a remanufactured alternator (which turned out to be faulty) and then a new one from Autozone which is replicating the same problem as the reman. (Mazda wants almost $400 for an OEM alternator and I'm about to bite the bullet and do it if I cannot find a fix.)

My issue is this: at idle and up to 3k, the alternator charges just fine. However, above 3k rpm, I'm reading upwards of 18-19V across the (brand new) battery, which causes the dash lights to double in intensity and the A/C to blow twice as hard. (Also, this only seems to happen when the AC is on, so it's either the increased load, or maybe faulty wiring there). **Note: the alternator has a regulator, and from what I can gather, the ECU has a part in voltage regulation.**

I'm no mechanic, but here's my guess(es):

I have either gotten two faulty alternators/regulators (1 reman and 1 new), the Protege may simply want an OEM alternator/regulator, there could bad ground somewhere (which may explain the alternator whine I was getting through the speakers at higher rpms) or a bad ECU. Last week, I cleaned up every chassis ground I could find with a Dremmel and grinding stone, but I fire it up for a few days until I get some coolant in there. (Cracked thermostat housing re-installing after flushing the cooling system...smh).

If you've gotten this far, thank you!"

2002 Dodge Ram won’t start
Hi there,
I have an 02 ram 1500 5.9l that sat for a couple of months after a pole fell on it and busted the hood and windshield. When I was finally able to take it in to have that damaged serviced, it wouldn’t start. I jumped it, and it seemed to start but the battery wouldn’t hold a charge. I assumed that was because it was so ancient I couldn’t read the install date stickers, so I put a new one in. (I bought this used one year ago and it has always run like a dream, sans one issue I’ll mention in a bit) Seemed to work like a charm, I took it to the shop, drove it for a few days and everything was fine. 

Then I went out one day to start it and it wouldn’t start. No clicking, nothing, just a little red light on the dash. I tried to jump it and it will turn over, but won’t completely start unless your foot is pressing on the gas. When you let go, it cuts off and it’s like the battery is dead all over again. My boyfriend went in and found this cable that he put some tension on, and as long as you’re tensioning it, it will stay running. We drove it from my old house to my new one this way, about 17 miles.

He doesn’t really know that much about cars, I’m not even sure how he figured out that’s what was going on. Can anyone tell me what’s happening so I can sound competent explaining it to a mechanic, and maybe what the problem is? The ones around here will take advantage of women if they sound like they don’t know what they’re talking about. I was already going to take it in to have a misfire due to a bad ignition coil serviced, could these be related? Thanks in advance for your help."

Plz help before I set my car on fire!
So I have a 2000 mustang, 6 cyl 3.8ltr (I know believe me I wish it was a V8 too, yet it is not)  so the car was running well until it sat for 9 months and developed some issues. I had to put new exhaust manifolds, breaks and roters, AC clutch and compressor, repair the starter, and I thought alternator and battery. So here is my current issue, after I changed the battery and put a used alternator on it the car is still acting like it has a power distribution issue. Spuddering, and no dash lights or gauges; But it still idols weakly. However if I turn on the headlights or fan or put a load of any type on the engine it dies immediately. Leading me to believe the used alternator I got was bad, so I went and bought a brand new one fully expecting it to fix the problem but had no progress what so ever.By this point the car will only run with jumper cables attached, the brand new alternator is providing 0 Entergy to the car and 0 charge to the brand new battery. So I began to look at the positive lead from the alternator to the post on the side of the fuse box where the battery, engine, and alternator leads all 3 meet.  So I inspected the Alternators output wire and found it had been poorly spliced together, and with it being the only thing between the alternator and the 2 things not receiving it's output, naturally I replaced the shitty wire with a new high quality battery wire expecting it to allow a healthy flow of energy. But no, again the symptoms remain the same. I am at a loss I thought maybe a fuse or relay but there are no fuses on the path it is all straight wiring. Does anyone know what could possibly be causing this power distribution issue?"

Canadian tire messed up my rotor... Can I do anything to not pay for their mistake?
Hey guys! This ended up being longer than I thought so I put a TL;DR at the bottom!

Recently I've been doing a lot of research on car repair because my car has got all kinds of small issues that I'd like to fix myself and NOT spend an arm and leg on.

Small backstory: my grandmother made the decision to give up driving and thus gave me her car, to which I am incredibly grateful. However the key to this post is that she took the car to Canadian Tire just before giving the car to me so that it would be in good repair (she had also done some damage to it that needed repair in itself)

Fast forward to now and my brake pads have suddenly worn down to near nothing. I had no indication that they were headed this way (no squeaking)- save for her telling me upon recieving the car that they were at 50%, fair enough, I have now put just over 10k on the car in a 6 month span so that's on me. I am questioning however, why they made no audible sounds until the break pins were grinding against the rotor itself (yes, this has done some damage in the form of a nice scrape)

Now here's the kicker. When I drive, without depressing the brakes, I can hear a very light flipping sound, kind of like a straw flicking. This and even the pins squealing can only be herd on the driver side? Very odd for normal wear. Anyways, I realised today that the flipping is likely the cause of the rotor being warped and each time that warpage hits the pins, it makes that flipping sound. 

Curiously, I checked the records of service that my grandma had given me. The bill was $1790.40 and one of the repairs was a machined rotor... First of all, why?? The pads were perfectly fine and the calipers are not seized, so they obviously upsold her. The bigger problem with this is that they OBVIOUSLY warped the rotors when they machined them. I have no seized calipers, the break pads are only recently worn and the steering wheel has been shaking while breaking at higher speeds since I got the car (which I might also mention was the reason they decided to machine them in the first place apparently). So now I'm pissed and know I need a new rotor, I don't wanna pay for that though...

TL;DR: grandma gave me a car she took to Canadian tire. They charged her a stupid amount, one of those things being the driver side rotor machined because it wobbles while breaking. Now I have the car, it still wobbles and my ""neglect"" of my breaks has given me proof the rotors are now warped and that this is very obviously NOT a result of a seized caliper or anything I have done or not done to the car. Because I am sure it was Canadian Tire that fucked up my rotor, is there anything I can do to make them replace it or reimburse me so I can get it replaced else where?

Have any of you had a similar situation? What did you do about it?

TIA"

Alternator issues
I drive an 07 Mustang with just over 100,000 miles on it. Recently, I was traveling and it wasn’t driven for ~3 weeks. I live in Texas, it’s very hot here and the car is always parked outside. When I tried to start it, it was dead and all the dashboard lights started flashing. I got the battery checked, it was fully charged and they successfully jumped it. I took it to a Valvoline because that’s where I purchased the battery. They told me the battery was fine and it’s probably my alternator that’s going out. I decided to wait on it and drove home.

Since then I’ve had no problems starting it. Years ago, probably around 2011/2012, my alternator died and it was replaced. I was a teenager at the time and my parents took care of it all, so I’m not sure if it was a new alternator or a refurbished one. I remember it costing around $900, so maybe it was new. 

Based on some googling, it seems like an alternator should last longer. I’ve put about 45,000 miles on the car since it was replaced ~2012. I work from home and have for years, so I don’t drive very much. I’m wondering if it sitting in the heat for so long caused it die? Or maybe the alternator is going out faster than usual because of another issue? I’ve heard electrical problems can cause this. 

I would love to know some other people’s thoughts on this situation. Are there any other signs I can look for that would tell me it’s my alternator? I obviously don’t want it to die while I’m driving like it did in 2012. I also don’t want to be replacing alternators willy nilly."

2008 Nissan Altima A/C only blowing hot air
I have a 2008 Nissan Altima and it only blows hot air, the cold air function of the car is not working. I have had the car for about 2 years and when I got it, it was winter and I was glad I had heat! Come last summer, I noticed I didn't have AC and was terrified as to how much it would cost to replace. I ended up doing a little research (I'm not really a car guy, but I have done a few things myself) and found out it could just be low on refrigerant. I got some A/C Pro and although it said it was charged, I added some more anyway. Well, the A/C actually was working again and worked all last summer long much to my relief.

Now, this summer, I figured oh I may have a leak but the A/C Pro worked for me last year and it's cheaper than getting something replaced or fixing a leak so what the heck, I bought another can, this time just the can since I had my old hose and gauge from the last year. I'm not 100% sure if the hose was working properly/if I broke the part that attaches to the can last year so I don't know, but this time the A/C pro did not help.

When I turn my car to put out hot air, it gets hotter than when it is on the cold setting, but I feel like the cold setting is just sending through the outside temperature (colder when it's cold out, warm-hot when it is hot out)

Just trying to see if anyone has any ideas as I am a broke college student and would like to spend as little as possible/just tough it out. I could go and buy another full thing of A/C pro and redo the process with a new can and hose but if you guys think that probably isn't the problem, I don't want to waste money. What can I check to see what could be wrong with the system before I take it to someone and spend a lot of money?

TL;DR My AC in my 2008 Nissan Altima is only blowing hot air, but it is blowing strong. Tried A/C Pro last year and it worked, this year it isn't working but I may have fucked up the hose from last year."

I took the battery in and had it charged and checked but no go on starting and I can’t even put the windows up.

How do I properly diagnose & fix the short? I dont know how to use a multimeter. Please explain or push me links on the dummies version.

Will the problem get worse if I dont fix it? The mechanic charges $100 just to diagnose the problem. I can drive the without any problems. I just have to remove the fuse every time I let it sit overnight.

My Geo was running fine until recently it had a problem where it would run but once you turned it off it wouldn't turn on like it would just click. But when. You jump it it'd start no problem so that means it's not the starter. I went under the hood to check the alternator. Turns out the bolt that held the ground broke and it was just leaning against what was left of the bolt and a bolt that mounted the alternator broke. So I replaced the alternator due to the broke ground bolt. Installed it and stuff now. Went to jump start it cause the battery was low because what was happening and the interior lights wouldn't even come on. Like there was no electricity flowing when I turned the key. I checked all the grounds. And all the terminals. All was good and I tested the battery and there was charge and power. Also there was charge going to the starter too I checked. I need help.

96 Cherokee Transmission Problems and Wiring Diagram
Greetings
I have been having transmission issues with my 96 XJ. Specifically, it is not shifting automatically. By downshifting manually to the ""1-2"" setting and then moving to 3 or D when above 2,500 RPM's I can drive fairly normally, but I'm sure that it is wreaking havoc on my transmission and fuel economy.
Stopping in at a transmission shop, the owner took a quick ride, diagnosed the problems as shifter solenoids not firing, took a look at the diagram showing that the transmission fails to 3rd gear when not getting power, and told me to have a good day. He was booked and didn't want to charge me to fix such an old vehicle.

I since then I parked the car for about two weeks with the neg terminal off as I waited for parts and then replaced the fuel pump assembly, spark plugs, pcv valve and cleaned the throttle body all at once and although the car runs way better it still sounds like it’s struggling at idle and SPECIFICALLY with the a/c on.  I’m the cars 7th owner (yikes ik) but the car has been reliable till now. With it having 6 previous owners I’ve never really known its history but it has an After market exhaust and I wouldn’t be surprised if it had a minor tune of some sort. I’ve owned the car for 5 months and it’s been reliable till now


Ive been told it could just be the learning period for the ecu as the car is unaware of the change but I’d love it if anyone can let me know if this is true


And also I know I could just to take it to the mechanic but I’d rather learn and figure this out

My question is, what is the best brand for an after-market fuel pump relay for my car?

Fix My Old Vehicles or Upgrade to Something New (and Write It Off)?
Hey everyone, looking for advice.

I own two vehicles outright:

* **2002 Toyota Tundra (184k miles, 2WD)** – old but reliable, mainly used for hauling and occasional trips
* **2015 VW Golf TDI (103k miles)** – great on gas, fun to drive, but small

The Tundra just got a **$7,400+ repair estimate** for a bunch of stuff: suspension, steering, engine mounts, fluids, and more. Some I could DIY, but it’s a lot. Still needs a working horn and cold A/C too.

The Golf is in decent shape but needs some maintenance soon (timing belt, tires, etc.).

I run a branding studio and could write off a new vehicle through the business. Thinking of selling both cars and putting that money (\~$15–20k) toward a newer Tundra or Tacoma, ideally 4x4 for winter travel and work shoots.

What would you do?

1. Fix the Tundra and keep both cars?
2. Sell both and finance something newer I can write off?
3. Get an SUV instead, like a 4Runner or GX?

Appreciate any advice, especially from anyone who’s done the small biz write-off route. Thanks!"

Issue with CarPlay connectivity
I drive a 2019 Nissan Altima SL, got just over 95,000 miles on it. Lately I’ve been having an issue with getting my phone to connect to the car in general but especially with CarPlay. It used to connect no problem, I just plug the cord into the USB port under the car display and connect it to my iPhone then I get CarPlay. But all of the sudden it doesn’t like to connect. I’ll plug my phone in and after a few seconds it will say CarPlay on my phone like it’s connecting and the option replaces “phone” on the car display and then the option changes back. After a few seconds I tries again and does the same thing or will display CarPlay on the display for a fraction of a second, then go back to the Bluetooth audio screen. Sometimes it goes through this ritual about 4 times before just deciding that my phone is actually an iPod and playing music that way, other times it just immediately thinks it’s an iPod and doesn’t attempt CarPlay, and still other times it just doesn’t do anything, not even connect via Bluetooth. 

Sometimes the issue happens more frequently when it’s colder and things function better after my car has been running for a while, other times it doesn’t matter the temperature. I’ve restarted my phone and that doesn’t fix anything, I’ve replaced the cord and no dice. 

I also noticed a long time ago that my volume dial on the display is screwy. When you turn the volume down it’s fine, but going up sometimes turns the volume up and more often than not it just drops the volume to 1. Continued turning up goes about like 1,2,1,1,2,3,4,0,1,2,0,1, etc. I only get reliable volume control from the steering wheel buttons. 

I’ve been coping with this for about 8 months and am starting to get annoyed enough to try and figure out how to fix it. So the question I have is what would you all as a community recommend I look into? Should I try and replace the display tablet?(this is what I thought I should do but don’t know what exactly that entails) Should I just take it to a mechanic? Is there a fuse perhaps? Is there an obvious broken thing I could just see if I knew where to look?"

Seeking Advice: Car Dealership Botched My Repairs — What Are My Options?
I’m dealing with a frustrating situation with a car dealership, and I’d love to get some advice from people who might have gone through something similar or just someone who knows a lot about engines. 

Here’s the timeline of events:

August 2023: I brought my 2018 Subaru Outback to Dealership A for a suspected oil leak. They diagnosed a leak from the driver-side cam case and performed repairs under my extended warranty.
December 2023: I brought it back because the car was still smelling like burning oil. They informed me that the timing cover had been damaged during the August repairs and was replaced at that time.
April 2024: I returned due to a low oil warning. The dealership diagnosed another leak, this time from the upper oil pan, and removed and resealed the engine under warranty.
Now (April 2024): I took the car to a different Subaru dealership, and they found multiple new leaks from the driver side cam carrier, passenger side camp cover, lower oil pan, upper oil pan, CVT front pump cover, and transmission oil pan. 
The car has been through two engine removals now, and I’m concerned about long-term reliability. My engine light coming on two different times due to these repairs could've damaged the cam bearings, crank bearings, internal engine damage due to oil starvation and repeated engine disassembly. Both times that my engines were removed and reassembled, the dealership did not clean my engine at all. My partner said it was the dirtiest dealership work he's ever seen. I’ve also reported this to Subaru Customer Advocacy, and I have a meeting scheduled with the service director of both dealerships on Tuesday to review the issues in person.

I’m wondering:

What should I demand from the dealership that botched the repairs (full engine replacement, loaner car, extended warranty, etc.)? At this point I would like this dealership it's currently at to do the work as I do not trust Dealership A. I also do not want to accept resealing as other components to the engine could have been damaged. 

Any tips for handling this meeting with the dealerships? What should I say to ensure a fair resolution?

Would really appreciate any advice, especially from anyone who has gone through a similar experience with car repairs or warranty issues!

Bmw 530e (B48 Motor) is reliable or not?
Hey there! I am thinking about buying BMW 530e, but I‘ve heard a lot of things about these engine so I‘d ask you as mechanics etc about your experiences with this car.

Disclaimer, I‘m not a mechanic or a person that really knows everything about cars so pls be polite😂

Reference car:
2018-2020 year, <123k km, country of origin Germany

1. Chain.
   Some friends told me that Bmw doesn’t have problems with 2.0 gasoline engine anymore, is that true? How often it should be changed or it lasts forever? 

2. Oil
   I drive mercedes 250e now, 75k km, bought it with 40k km, changed oil only once at 60kkm, last time it was changed before i bought at ~30kkm, but I‘ve heard there is an issue with oil in BMW engines and I have to change oil every 7-8k, is it also true? 

3. in general engine. How reliable is it?

Solid Check Engine light just returning Catalytic Converter error - Is there a workaround?
Hi everyone. I drive an 05 Toyota Camry that keeps presenting Check Engine light errors which only show up as Catalytic Converter congestion related errors when checked by a code reader machine. My mechanic who has reset the light several times before does not believe a full CC replacement is necessary because I do not live in a state with required vehicle emissions standards that make replacing this necessary. I know cleaner products exist, and I also know this error will just keep showing up if I do not take any action. For peace of mind, I am wondering at this point if there is a consistent reliable solution to get this error and related light (which is just solid, not flashing) to go away that does not require buying cleaners over and over again, and having the mechanic turn the light off after code read testing over and over again. I know replacing a CC can be expensive, and that CC's get stolen, so am just looking for a good recommendation as to how to proceed. Thank you all."

Blown Engine, Just outside of Warranty
Hey all,

I am looking at an engine replacement that could end up costing me $7k. I have had multiple estimates, and honestly this is looking like the best option (just to clarify that I have called around and asked for many estimates).

That being said, I don't have the money to afford this repair. I have a lean on the car, and I have to get replaced or else I would have to scrap the vehicle, and still have a car payment.

Does anyone know of a reliable financing source for paying a bill over time for repair? I have decent credit and just looking for advice if anyone has used a certain company before.

2013 Subaru Forester 2.5x

Thanks for any info. I can not afford this repair and the car payment will keep coming. I will probably take a loan on my 401k if I really have to, but trying to avoid that."

Hello r/CarRepair Redditors!

If you are a frequent flyer of this subreddit you may have seen things start to change a bit and things get tidied up (rules, appearance, etc.). After a bit of time in a weird limbo state our sub has begun to get its feet under it again and we want to thank all of you who continued to frequent the sub and keep it active. We are very excited about the future of our subreddit and being a place where you can find reliable advice on your car-related issues.

With that, one of the most important things that we have updated is our ruleset. For a while, it was quite lackluster and left the sub open to a lot of issues over time. Now that we have cleaned that up we want to take the opportunity to run through them so everyone is familiar with them. Please see below for our ruleset most of which are pretty standard for Reddit but we want to make sure everyone is on the same page moving forward.

1. Be Respectful
2. Car Repair Content Only
3. Please include Year, Make, and Model **(PLEASE SEE BELOW FOR IMPORTANT NOTE ON THIS RULE)**
4. No Advertising or Self Promotion
5. No Buying or Selling
6. No Politics
7. No AI Generated Content
8. Do Not Intentionally Provide Bad Advice

As mentioned above rule 3 is a slightly unique one in that it **will not be enforced** and is more of a recommendation so you can get the best help possible. Over time we have solidified ourself as a subreddit as being more focused on cosmetic issues so items like Year, Make, and Model (mileage even less) are not as critically important to diagnosing an issue and providing advice/estimates. That being said we still provide support for mechanical issues so that is why we encourage you to include all the information needed in your post to get the best help possible as fast as possible.

Again, thank you everyone who has participated in the subreddit and we are very much so looking forward to a bright future of car repair with you all!

Does the clutch need replacing when the gearbox is replaced?
My car (2012 Hyundai i10) broke down today, and the breakdown recovery man reckons it's a problem with the gearbox. We then took it into a garage, and the guy there was saying the clutch will need replacing too, even though the clutch is only 2 months old. He was saying that the clutch can get contaminated by the oil leaking from the gearbox, and that whenever the gearbox gets replaced it's best to replcae the clutch too. Does this seem right, or is it likely he's trying to upsell? He said this without having looked at the car himself, since it was almost closing time.

Choosing the Right Auto Mechanic: Tips for Consumers
Selecting the right [auto mechanic](http://instamek.com/cities/mechanic-calgary/) is a crucial decision for every vehicle owner. Whether you need routine maintenance or complex repairs, a trustworthy and skilled mechanic can make a significant difference in the performance and longevity of your vehicle. To help consumers make informed choices, here are some valuable tips for choosing the right auto mechanic.

# 1. Ask for Recommendations:

Start your search by asking friends, family, and colleagues for recommendations. Personal referrals are often the most reliable way to find a trustworthy mechanic. Inquire about their experiences, including the quality of work, pricing, and customer service.

# 2. Check Qualifications and Certifications:

Look for auto mechanics with proper qualifications and certifications. The National Institute for Automotive Service Excellence (ASE) certification is a widely recognized credential that demonstrates a mechanic's competence in various automotive repair areas. ASE-certified mechanics have passed rigorous exams and are required to update their knowledge regularly.

# 3. Research Online Reviews:

Browse online review platforms such as Google, Yelp, or Angie's List to read reviews and ratings for auto repair shops in your area. Pay attention to both positive and negative feedback, and look for trends in customer experiences. Keep in mind that a few negative reviews may not be cause for concern, but a consistent pattern of complaints should be taken seriously.

# 4. Visit the Shop:

Before committing to a mechanic, visit their shop in person. Assess the cleanliness and organization of the facility, which can be indicative of their professionalism and attention to detail. Speak with the staff to gauge their communication and customer service skills.

# 5. Ask Questions:

When you visit the mechanic or contact them over the phone, don't hesitate to ask questions. Inquire about their experience with your specific make and model of vehicle, the types of services they offer, and their pricing structure. A reputable mechanic should be transparent and willing to provide clear answers.

# 6. Request Estimates:

Obtain written estimates from multiple auto mechanics for the services you require. This will help you compare prices and ensure you are not being overcharged. Be cautious of significantly lower or higher quotes, as they may indicate subpar work or hidden fees.

# 7. Check for Warranties and Guarantees:

Inquire about warranties or guarantees offered by the auto repair shop. A trustworthy mechanic is often willing to stand behind their work with a warranty, which can provide peace of mind in case issues arise after the repair.

# 8. Consider Specializations:

Some mechanics specialize in specific areas, such as engine diagnostics, electrical systems, or certain vehicle makes and models. If your vehicle has unique needs or a complex issue, consider seeking out a mechanic with expertise in the relevant specialization.

# 9. Verify Licenses and Insurance:

Ensure that the auto repair shop holds the necessary licenses and insurance coverage. A licensed shop is more likely to adhere to industry standards and regulations, while insurance coverage can protect you and your vehicle in case of accidents or damage during the repair process.

# 10. Trust Your Instincts:

Ultimately, trust your instincts when choosing an auto mechanic. If something feels off or you have reservations about a particular shop, it's perfectly acceptable to continue your search. Your comfort and confidence in your chosen mechanic are essential for a successful and stress-free repair experience.

# 11. Start with Small Jobs:

If you're unsure about a new mechanic, consider starting with smaller, less complex jobs like routine maintenance or minor repairs. This will give you an opportunity to assess their workmanship and reliability before entrusting them with more significant repairs.

# 12. Establish a Long-Term Relationship:

Building a long-term relationship with a reputable mechanic can be beneficial. A trusted mechanic who is familiar with your vehicle's history and needs can provide more personalized service and offer preventive maintenance recommendations tailored to your vehicle's specific requirements.

In conclusion, choosing the right auto mechanic is a crucial decision for vehicle owners. By following these tips and conducting thorough research, you can select a trustworthy and skilled mechanic who will ensure the safety, performance, and reliability of your vehicle. Building a solid relationship with a reliable mechanic can provide peace of mind and save you time and money in the long run.

Can I do anything about the bill?
I generally like the service repair shop and they've done good repair work. A/C was not working in the old reliable van. So they put in some part that blocks the a/ c from the back so only the front would work as I  agreed. The Bill was $800. I had to take it back bc the front ac still wouldn't work.  It never did after the repair and refill of ? Freon? . They told me the next problem was the evaporator core, therefore it would be a grand. And if I fixed it there is no guarantee of another leak. I understand it's an old vehicle, but it sucks that the first bill was $800.  I wasn't told there would still be problems.  They will not adjust the bill. Should I ask for an adjustment or am I out of line given it's an old vehicle."

Car overheating with AC running in high ambient temps.
Hello and thanks for any help. We have a 2009 Ford Flex SEL and have been having issues with the hot air blowing while idling and engine temp rising while the AC is running. The rising engine temp doesn’t reliably occur. Temps in our area run high in the summer (between 100-110 at peak daytime hours). We replaced the AC fan assembly, the expansion valve, the thermostat and topped off the coolant (all in the past two weeks). The changes have improved the issue but not gotten rid of it. The issue seems to get worse the higher the ambient temps. We are also planning on putting ceramic tinting on the windows. Any insight would be greatly appreciated."

I turned off the A/C and waited to see if it would go off, but after another 5 minutes it was still on, so I pulled off to the side, turned off the car, and popped the hood. While the hood was up and cooling off, I noticed that all the coolant had run out and the reservoir had gone dry. So rather than drive it, I towed it a dealership service center. Before driving it from the parking lot of the service center to the bay, we added some coolant and it did leak out, leading me to believe there was a crack in the radiator, or the reservoir, or a bad hose. But the temp light never came on. When I let the tech know they said they would take a look and get back with me.

The next day they called and informed me I would need a whole new engine (but I'm in luck, they have one there, used with only 10K more miles on it than my engine and will have it installed for just about $6000) wasn't exactly what I wanted to hear, and the fact there were no lights, no sounds, nothing fishy with the way it drove, nothing that would lead me to believe there was engine failure of any kind, had me scratching my head. I'd been in regularly for oil changes, and through their ""X-amount point inspections"" nothing was ever identified as problematic. The last one was just a month before this occured. So rather than shell out for it there, we did a little inspection, added enough coolant but not so much that it overfilled, and drove it to a non-dealer mechanic that my family knows and trusts. they're about 20 miles south of us and will have them look at it and see if there really is anything that warrants needing a replaced engine. But on that 20 mile drive down, no warning lights, no sounds, nothing. Drove just fine. And it didn't leak this time, coolant level stayed exactly at the amount we put in.

Is it actually possible for an overheated engine to need replacing for such a short indicator? Is this just sketchy service/maintenance sales tactics? Seems a bit bold to tell someone they need a whole new engine and all they give you to go off of is that they identified it during this inspection. The engine has some miles (107K when this happened) but from my previous cars, most have been fine without major issues usually to about 150K-200K with regular maintenance check-ins.

As for the car itself, I drive the trendiest clown shoe any happening great-aunt would love to have, a 2016 Nissan Juke. Had the CVT replaced a few years back, but apart from that, it's been a reliable little commuter car. Any other Juke/Nissan owners have similar issues? I'm curious to what this family owned shop will say when they check it out, but until then I figured I could see if anyone else has experienced something like this."

2014 VW Passat EPC light is on
Hi there car enthusiasts,

I need your help! I have a 2014 Volkswagen Passat Wolfsburg edition with an EPC light on.

So I recently took my car to the mechanics because (1) my airbag light was on-indicating that my airbags weren't working (2) my car horn wasn't working and (3) All the buttons on the steering wheel were not working. The mechanics replaced the dashboard clockspring ($750 for labor and parts). This fixed all the issues although now I have an EPC light on (I noticed it was on when leaving the mechanics, it was NOT on prior). I took it back to the same mechanic who said there was a communication error with my circuits. They were able to turn off the EPC light saying it is sending error codes such as..  ""driver door electronics"" and ""window regulator"" but that it is misreading these as errors and that there are no actual errors and is instead a communication issue. They then asked if my battery was bad. But I had recently gotten my battery placed from AAA a few months ago with no issues.

The mechanic said they reset everything and that there are no other problems and were able to turn off the EPC light. They also said to continue driving it and see how the car handles and reassured me that the car is safe to drive. The next day the EPC light turned back on! I'm on a trip and have to get back home (a 6-hour drive) and am worried about the EPC light still being on.. should I be concerned? When I google it, it says it is not safe to drive.

The mechanic seems reliable and trustworthy although I'm not sure. Any suggestions on what I should do in this case would be greatly appreciated.

Thank you!"

Removing KARR security device?
Hi everyone, I recently took my 2018 Mazda CX-5 in to the my local Mazda dealership due to a major and very sudden drop in MPG after filling up one day. In addition to a drop in MPG, my MPG readings became very inconsistent. My MPG Average had gone up from what it was in the past 6 months, but my actual fuel level reading was dropping dramatically and the real-time MPG gauge was giving me very low and inconsistent MPG readings as well.

My mechanic pointed out that there was a KARR security device that had been installed and that Mazda has informed their mechanics to remove this device due to it causing issues in cars. He said the MPG issue could be related to the KARR device. They offered to remove it at a cost, but I'm curious if I can simply disconnect it from the wire harness, making it inactive, or is there more to it? Do they wire them in a way that the only reliable process is by fully removing all wiring related to KARR?   


Also, I'd love to hear from anyone with a similar experience related to KARR devices?"

What is the right path to take?
I have a 2010 Forester, 5spd non turbo 2.5, bout 110,000 miles. I still owe $6,500 on the car, as I just reached one year with it. When I bought it I did not realize the rate at which it burned through oil and eventually it led to a knock on the engine, it still drives as it did but obviously this only leads one place. The horn decided to stick on randomly, so I have the fuse pulled but it won’t pass inspection without it. I was also in a small accident with the front fender being damaged with some scraped on the bumper. I truly don’t care about the cosmetic aspect of the car, I have a kid and two big dogs that put a beating on every car I’ve had; but I don’t know what my best option is here? Do I take a loss and try and trade it in on something else? Do I try and source an engine myself and have a friend do the swap (reliable mechanic in the family, would probably charge me between $700-$1000 on top of the cost of an engine, do I pay a bum to drive it into a River? I just don’t know what to do, and I’m not in a position where I have a security blanket laying around right. Thanks for looking and your opinion."

Subaru Outback 2017 Transmission Blow
The week before Christmas, my beloved Subaru Outback was taken into a trusted body shop to get the transmission serviced because it was recommended.  It had been running fine but I wanted to keep up with it as it had surpassed 100,000 miles (106 to be exact). After I got it back something seemed off, and my husband took it back in and they looked over it again and said it was fine and probably just acting up because it was cold out (that big snowstorm was moving into the Midwest at that point) and adjusting to the new fluids.  I had the week off between Christmas and New Years so I didn’t really drive my car, but the following week still I felt something was off with my car…I thought it had a weird smell once I got to work (30 min drive) and had a slight different sound to it. 

Fast forward the first long drive we took was this past Saturday with it.  We got 45 min out and my transmission stopped working.  We got stranded on the side of the highway and had it towed to a Subaru dealership.  We talked to the body shop and they said IF they were at fault they’d pay to get it fixed entirely (yay!).  They approved us to have the dealership to diagnose it.  The maintenance guys on Saturday had assured us that they were nearly certain it was the work done at the body shop that caused it based on our experience.  Yesterday they got back to us (different guy) and said they weren’t sure yet what caused it but have to remove and replace the entire transmission.  They quoted the work for a little over $9,000.  They told my husband that I needed to approve it and they could go from there to hopefully figure out what happened but there could be a chance that it was just bad luck and I’m stuck with that bill….I still owe $16,000 on it as I bought it fairly new because I wanted a reliable car after a ton of issues with my last car.

I guess does anyone have any thoughts about the likelihood that my Subaru’s transmission just self destructed?  Or would you think the auto shop is at fault? It’s a 2017 Outback, I love that car so much and never had any issues with it prior.  It had been inspected twice this past year when I got new tires and then brakes and everything looked and ran great.  I’m not a car person at all, but I tried really hard to take care of my Subaru and did the research when I was looking for a car to find something that would not leave me stranded like my last car did. I cannot believe it needs this amount of work only two years into owning the car just by bad luck."

Clicking then more of a Clunking after rear brake pads & rotors replaced

Hi.  My car never made any strange sounds before.  2014 Nissan Rogue SL AWD.  Had 4 new tires put on & a front end alignment. Belle tire told me I also needed new rear pads & rotors.  Quote was over $400 & my online search showed that to be a bit high.  A family friend (& this as you may suspect is where the story goes downhill) who has his own private auto mechanic business did the repair for a much better price, but then after a short period I noticed my car making a clicking sound when braking, especially at low speeds coming from the rear on both sides of the car at different times.  He took the car again and greased some pins?  & said it was all fixed.   It wasn’t & now the sound is getting worse,  more of a clunking sound.  When I started my car leaving work yesterday & just driving through the parking lot it was making all kinds of clunky sounds.  He wanted to take the car to look at it again,  but now I really do not trust him.  My car never made any sound like this & I get the brake repair & now sounds like a beater.    

I’m curious what thoughts are on this…. Should I go to a place like Belle Tire or straight to the dealership?   & do I have any right to ask for a refund or anything from the person I suspect jacked (literally & figuratively) my previously very reliable vehicle.  

Thanks for any helpful insight or guidance"

Toyota Yaris 1.5 (2017): coolant loss, radiator fan on very often
Hallo people,

first of all, sorry for my bad English, it is not my mother tongue. :)

I have a problem with my otherwise reliable Yaris with the 1.5 l engine and 80.000 km driven, mostly highway. Since I got it, it always had a tiny loss of engine coolant. After a vacation and a lot of km driven a month ago, the coolant reservoir was almost empty. There was water on the bottom of the floor cover things, but unclear if coolant or rain water.

Also the radiator fan is on way too often, even after very moderate drives in cool weather. It also activates more often than before, basically each time after driving and then slowing down. The fan shuts off when I switch off the engine.

Temperature gauge is normal. No check engine light.

Went to the dealership, they found no leaks, and the coolant system was pressure tested, nothing.

No idea what to do now, the car has to work many years to come and i am afraid of damage from overheating. No idea where the coolant goes. No idea if the car overheats or if faulty sensor. No idea if both problems are connected to each other or not.

Can you help me diagnose what's wrong please?

Thank you so much."

Cost of luxury vehicle routine maintenance, and can I do it myself.
Hello everyone.  I am looking to buy a fairly new, low mileage luxury vehicle, ideally a Mercedes SUV or perhaps a BMW.  I have been told that the routine maintenance - oil changes, plugs, filters, etc. - are extremely expensive.  Is this true?  If so, is there any reason I cant do those routine things on my own, just as I do now with my trusty Toyota truck (keeping it by the way, far too reliable!).  

It doesnt make sense to me that an oil change for a Merc or BMW would cost more than on my truck.  Its oil, a filter, and some labor.  What, if anything am I missing?  

BTW, my intent is to find a low mileage vehicle coming off a lease or being returned by a single owner. This will be our 2nd vehicle for when the SO and I go places, take trips, etc.  The Tacoma is my daily and she is WFH."

Question about a band-aid solution for low oil pressure when engine at operating temperature for end of life car.
I won't be repairing this car. Audi a3 2012. Not looking at troubleshooting any further. I've done everything to troubleshoot and I took it to an Audi service center and it's just not worth fixing now as it will require either an oil pump or balance shafts and even possibly a new bearing for them. Very costly as they're built into the engine. Anyway...

Basically, the issue is that only when it gets to *operating temp* the oil pressure falls steeply to the point where the engine struggles.

1.5-2 Bars (22-29psi) is the standard  but runs at 0.5Bars (7.25psi) when heated up to operating temp.

THEORETICALLY: If I put in a thicker oil than specified for this car, it could temporarily help the issue, is my understanding. It's running 5w40 as the standard. What oil viscosity would you recommend to try, considering this amount of drop in PSI? I was thinking 5W-50, but do you think that oil pressure difference would necessitate a higher viscosity? 60?

Technically the oil would be more viscous, which should help in theory at operating temp? When the engine has not reached full temp and the oil is a bit thicker and cooler, it **runs beautifully**, so I thought this could be a Band-Aid solution until it's ready to go to the grave in a few months (hopefully), and it's becoming less drivable now.

And I just want to stretch the life of the car a bit longer, I don't care if doing this ends up gumming up & damaging the engine longer term I just want to get more stability/reliability of of it while it's still running over the next few mo, because it struggles sometimes when after reaching normal operating temp.

I've searched on Google and most people say don't do it, and some people say if it's an old car just do it as a band-aid. I'm going with the latter because I don't care if things get wrecked longer term.

Pls lemme know what you think re viscosity vs the PSI reading!"

2013 Corolla radio touch screen
A few days ago, my radio stopped working reliably. The touch screen no longer woks at all - pushing the ""buttons"" (i.e. screen fields) on the screen does nothing. And the manual buttons and knobs are significantly less sensitive. I have to push the volume/power knob very hard multiple times just to turn it on - then the manual buttons on the steering wheel and radio itself seem to work okay.

This happened the day after I cleaned out the interior of my car. Typically I'll spray a rag with Armor All and wipe everything down. I don't spray onto the radio, but I do get the rag fairly wet. Perhaps some Armor all got squeezed in around the perimeter of the radio trim.

Is the repair worth it?
Okay so obviously I know very little about cars, I'm a college student in need of transportation this year with limited money to spend on it. We have a 2001 Buick century that's been sitting in the garage for a few months. In the past two years almost everything on this car has been fixed or replaced. The mileage is low and the tires are good. Here's the the thing, the cam is broken, my dad said that the car is basically shot, since he doesn't want to put a new motor in it. 

My plan has been to save the money and be able to repair it rather than wait until I can but some random used car. I've been told my my mother that it's a huge Gamble and not worth trying because I have no guarantee that the motor I buy will work, even know if I get it from a reliable source or test it first. She's convinced that I'm going to be wasting my money and the car still won't work. 

So has anyone had any success with such a fix or am I delusional to think I can save this car?"

Gas Gauge continued to go haywire . Saying I had a lot of gas,then jumping down ( began to see how this could have been the prob in the first place since I knew gauge said I had gas!) took it back in and they put another fuel pump in - said the previous one was faulty( I had already decided to go somewhere else due to steep prices $700?? ) then it ran ok for a few months.Then all gauges went berserk . ) I was going to take it back to them, when car shut off. Seemed electric to me ,(Like it tripped a safety lock was one guess because I had a tow recently?) Was talked into buying a new battery by friend , even though I knew that wasn’t it (because friend tested battery-was extremely low-even though we charged it all night) I put new one in myself. Nothing . Took it into a shop recommended by a friend , where he doagnosed it as something electrical and referred me to another shop that specializes in wiring /electrical issues. They got it running $500 later. Then gauges immediately up down fuel and rpms ?! So was going to take it back to that shop, when car just cut off -after starting it , abd driving 2 blocks. smelled rubber. Coasted into a gas station. A belt had burned. Water was extremely low! Put water in, wouldn’t start. Stopped immediately and had towed home. Took to shop that specializes in electrical/wiring , where they said it was a belt and one of the pulleys , and wanted to fix all of them fir $1200 . Had towed to shop recommend by friend again for second opinion, he said it was the air compressor and pulley and $900 to fix ?! Or could bypass something or other for $250, but I wouldn’t have cold air. (My ac needed charging -I had been having to do that once per year since I bought the car 10 years ago-so it wasn’t blowing cold air at moment for me to notice change in cold air coming out) it’s Florida in hot sun so .. thought about it, asked if everything else looked good on car , so if I invested $900.00, did he think I’d be good? Yes. As soon as I drove it home and pulled up in the driveway, gauges started going berserk again, engine cut off., water leaked out?! .( 5 miles) I drove it immediately back to him and it drove fine the entire way there and started for him and ran fine while I was there of course. He looked at it and said , no reason anything should be wrong with it , abd he’d be comfortable driving it across country ?! I asked if I should take it home over weekend( since was Friday)  and see what happened. If it would be ok and it wouldn’t mess anything up? He said no. Well, I drove it for a couple quick runs to the store ,was fine.  and then I drove it a couple miles up road, when cold air from newly charged air (with new new compressor) went out And then water was boiling out of the water resovior again ! ? Causing the car to smoke when water hit hot engine . I drove it immediately home. Took it back to him , and this time , he said i needed a new hose and would have to pay to recharge the Freon because it leaked out Of the hose! I asked wouldn’t that have been part of the air compressor repair and new Freon put in ? He replied, no. It’s common that when you put in a new air compressor, old hoses will  crack /break?!  and and A cracked plastic water resovior. That was the cause of the water splashing out,!? Another $400 ?!? I was pissed at this point because it was non stop fir weeks now?! And once I put in $500, then  felt should do the $900, then after all that money, i had to invest$400 more etc etc, to see if I can’t get this car working ?!? Very soon after that , all the gauges including the speedometer, odometer, gas gauges , would all cut off. Stay off a while,then come back on. So was going to take back to somebody?! ?!  But pulled out of driveway, and car shut off and I coasted it off to side of road, and now seemed to be fuel issue- took back to the fuel pump place. They said thre was no compression in engine -prob broken timing belt ?!? Towed acreoss street to have that diagnosed, no., timing belt in tact?!? Need new engine?!? Now I’m sorry ,,... but I am thinking that all  these things are not seperate issues, and the mechanic who fixed the air compressor/ pulley / belt /hose /and water resovior , let me drive my engine into the ground  by not diagnosing it properly and by letting me keep driving off with the car, every time he “fixed” it. Opinions? I’d LIVE TO HEAR THEM?!  I truly want to call him and let him know what the hell happened now? But I want to know what I’m talking about when I do ?! Over $2000between him and mechanic who did electric ( I’m not counting the $700 for the fuel pump from the first pricey place? I’m really frustrated,what can I do? Any ideas? I want to sue him, fir all my money abd stress and time , but not sure how to prove he didn’t fix my car , and in fact caused it to die , by telling me it was fixed over and over again, and letting me drive it away?!  No way the original burned belt/water boiling out of the car, is not related to the next time after the air compressor was replaced when water was boiling out of plastic resovior abd he replaced the hose-recharged it with Freon , abd replaced a cracked resovior, abd is not related tobengine cutting out abd now having no compression?! No way! ? Am I wrong ? How do I handle this?!  I am on  disability and live on $771 a month?! This is financially devastating to me to have done all of this work abd paid all of this money , and now have nothing. Any suggestions, opinions, advice ?  Thank you for taking the time to read this and reply. "

What not to overlook when buying a used Lexus sedan?
Hi.

I'm thinking about buying my first car ever. I don't have much money, so I thought about buying a used car with high mileage from brands that do have a good rep for reliability, and Lexus seems to be perfect for that purpose .

I'm checking some ads for IS-250s AWD models from 2005-2009, but I'm still a little bit reluctant, what I've noticed is that:

- Some cars have their navigation system broken, that doesn't seem to be a big deal.
- No owner so far has confirmed whether if they have replace the timing belt/chain or not, but I'm assuming they haven't.
-One 2007 which I'm very interested in seems to have everything working well.. except the headlights, I texted the owner and he told me ""Need headlight bulb or blace for safety,  Maybe both...or only balace "". That sounds like some electrical problem.

I don't want to throw away thousands of dollars in repairs  of an old car, what other signs should normally be asked for before buying a Lexus with over 200k km / 130k miles on it?

Regards"

Did I Ruin My 2011 Chevy Aveo?
Hi y’all,

Recharged a killed battery the other day but when I went to reinstall it in my 2011 Chevy Aveo LT I stupidly was thinking of the orientation of the battery in the video and didn’t slow down to check while I installed it - of course I realized when the lights and horn roared on I’d messed up. Got a new battery in there but she still won’t start, but all dash lights and air conditoning comes on. Radio will not turn on. I when you turn the key no clicks, doesn’t try to turn over. 
 Do y’all think I killed it? I have a multimeter and and an OB2 scanner, but haven’t used either before. How best or proceed?
Thanks in advance y’all; I can’t believe what a dummy I was. I hope I haven’t ruined my car!"

Car won’t Crank/Start
Car: 2007 Camry LE 4 Cylinder

Just to summarize my situation…

About 2 Weeks ago my car battery went out on me, so I went to AutoZone and bought another one.

Put it into my Camry and the Car ran fine for about 10 Days until the battery died on me again. So went back to AutoZone and had them charge it, took it back home and the car would start fine again. Next Day left the house and ended up stranded at a Shopping center because the car wouldn’t turn on after coming back out of the store. Had to get towed home and when the tow guy tested my battery it displayed 5.6V but when I took the battery to AutoZone to have them tested it said “Good Battery” 100% Charge Status.

At this point I’m assuming that the alternator is trash because clearly the battery is not charging while driving. Sure enough after having all 3 test, Starter was trash as well as the Alternator capacitor. So I replaced all 3 today and had them tested at AutoZone and all 3 Passed as Good but yet AGAIN after driving for 1h, the car wouldn’t start.

Also once the car runs, there are no symptoms or anything that could indicate some sort of issue

I’m praying someone in here is able to help me narrow down what the problem could be…

Forgot to mention that everytime I put a new battery in, I can start the car 5-6 without problems and then it happens


I replaced:

Starter Alternator Battery Serpentine Belt

2001 Chrysler Town and Country
I went to look at my parents minivan because it stopped starting and this started after the winter. The transmission display puts a box over every gear and the car won’t start. When you take the key out the dash lights start blinking and heading over to the engine it sounds like the fuel injectors are clicking away. If you disconnect the battery for a bit the car will attempt to start usually cranking for a second or two but then this behavior returns. In the past it would randomly shut off even if driving and disconnecting the battery for about 2 minutes would allow the van to start again and it would be fine for weeks or months. I do have an idea of what I think the problem is but I would like opinions on what the community thinks to see if my thoughts align with people more experienced than I. "

03 VW golf gti vr6 24v
Just bought this golf I drove it for 3 days it threw 2 codes one for the camshaft sensor(replaced) and one for o2 sensor(no biggie after market exhaust). It died and won’t start, battery has full charge, and it cranks forever. It will crank for as long as I hold the key over, But it never starts any ideas? 

Sub context: A shop said it needed timing and that the way they knew was cause of the sensor code and the chain was loose but I pulled the valve cover and timing cover off and the chain is tensioned properly. "

Gear Indicator Disappearing from Dashboard Hyundai
Hello community,

My 2015 Hyundai Elantra Limited has started doing something really weird: the gear indicator disappears from the dashboard. When I turn off the car and wait about 10 minutes, the gears will show up again; however, after a few seconds, it disappears once more and won’t let me start the car or even crank the engine. I also noticed a check engine light?

A friend told me that may be the neutral safety switch, will it make sense?

Battery or alternator?
I left my 2012 CRV in the garage for a week while we were on vacation. Just went to turn it on and the car won’t start. The battery was replaced within the last year so I’m guessing it’s likely the alternator unless you all think one week of non-use could be responsible on an older car. Of course it’s Sunday and nothing is open. I’m wondering if I should try to jump it myself or just have it towed to the shop tomorrow in case it’s the alternator. Thoughts?"

Car won’t start after driving with the handbrake on
Hey everyone, I’m trying to figure out what’s wrong with my car after an electrical issue.

A while ago, I accidentally drove with the handbrake engaged. The car still moved, but when I reached my destination and turned it off, it wouldn’t start again. The lights and radio still worked, but the engine wouldn’t crank.

After checking, I found that a fuse related to the engine management system had blown. Later, I discovered that a track on the ECU was damaged, but I had it repaired. Recently, I noticed a wire in the front harness that seemed to be shorting against another. After separating them, the short was gone, and the fuse no longer blew.

Now, when I turn the key, I hear relays clicking, but the car still won’t start. What could be the issue? Could the starter, ECU, or another component still be affected? Any advice would be really helpful.

Thanks!

Need Help Diagnosing Overheating and Starting Issues with My 2009 Pontiac Vibe AWD
Hi everyone,

I'm having some serious issues with my 2009 Pontiac Vibe AWD and could use some advice. Here's what's going on:

Symptoms Before Repair: Serpentine belt started squeaking a few days ago, then began smoking. The battery light came on, and the car wouldn’t drive at one point. I noticed the water pump pulley was seized, so I replaced the water pump and the serpentine belt.

Current Issues: After the repair, the car wouldn’t start—it just cranked and cranked. Eventually, it started after a lot of cranking and ran okay, but:

The coolant reservoir level stayed full, but I noticed the coolant bouncing around.

The temperature gauge spiked to ""H"" during a short drive, so I pulled over. There was coolant spilled in the engine bay, and a small puff of smoke came from the exhaust area.

On the way home, the temp gauge dropped to ""C,"" shot back up to ""H,"" and then fell to ""C"" again.


Other Details: When I removed the old water pump, no coolant spilled out.


Now the car cranks but won’t start again. Could this be air in the cooling system, a blown head gasket, or something else? There’s no milky oil, and the car drove fine (once it started) before the temp issues.

Any ideas or advice would be appreciated. Let me know if more details are needed!

Thanks in advance!

😖‘17 Jeep Gr. Ch. won’t start
My wife’s Jeep’s battery died, while parked in the garage of all places.  Fortunately, I found a video showing how to access & pull a switch to put the transmission into neutral from inside the console.  So, I pushed it out of the garage and into the (sloped) driveway, so that I could pull my car next to hers and jump it.  After a while, her Jeep had enough battery life to display the dashboard, lights, etc.  The problem is that now, it acts like it wants to start…it just never quite gets there.

Battery acting up. 
Hello! I have a 2003 Toyota Tacoma. The battery is less than a year old and every once in a while, maybe once every two months, the truck won’t start. After going through this a few time trying to jump it and all that, I’ve learned that disconnecting the battery and reconnecting allows it to start. It’s worked almost every time with the exception of one time when I tried to start it after not driving it for over a month and the battery just seemed to be dead. I put it on a charger over night and that was the last time the ol’ disconnect/reconnect truck hasn’t worked. 
Also worth noting that there’s a fair amount of deposit build-up on the battery cables and terminals. I’ve cleaned them up before and they tend to get gnarly again pretty quickly. 


Any ideas? I had it into a shop recently for another issue and they didn’t notice anything going on with the starter/alternator. Could it be as simple as replacing the battery? Just not sure why disconnecting and reconnecting it would do anything if the battery was bad.

Lemme know whatcha think!

Car Won’t Start — Getting No Response from the Starter, What Should I Check?
Hey everyone,  
I’m working on troubleshooting a starting issue with my **W207 E250 2015** and I’m hoping someone can point me in the right direction. Here’s what I’ve got so far:

* **Symptoms**: When I turn the key, I hear relays click when the key is in position 2 (on), but when I turn it to the ""start"" position, I get no sound from the starter relay or any attempts from the starter to engage.
* **What I’ve Checked**:
   * Battery is fully charged and the terminals are clean and tight.
   * The **starter motor itself works** (bench tested).
   * No clicks, no cranking, and no noise at the starter relay when the key is turned to ""start"".

**Things I’ve tried**:

* I swapped the starter relay with another similar one.
* Tried jumping the starter to the relay directly, still no response.

I’ve also checked for loose wiring at the starter, battery, and ground connections, and everything seems good. Any thoughts on what might be causing this? Could it be the ignition switch, wiring, or a safety switch issue?

I’m feeling a bit stuck and would really appreciate any suggestions or things to check."

This issue started when randomly the clutch would get stuck to the floor for maybe half a second before swinging up back to where it should be, I drove the car on the highway home, only problem was shifting was extremely jolty, read online that it’s probably the master, replaced it, didn’t work, replaced the slave, didn’t work, vacuum bled the hell out of both now, but while the car is running, the car won’t go into gear unless pushing down on the clutch, however it doesn’t engage at all, not even a little power, nothing, is there anything else I should try or is it time to throw in the towel and replace the clutch"

Help diagnosing 2014 Subaru Outback rough start 
Recently as it’s gotten a little colder (maybe down to 30 at night) my car has been cranking normally but then puttering for a little while before coming to life. I’ve recently replaced the battery, changed the oil, and the air filter. It only does it on a cold start and never after the car is warmed up - it’s sometimes bad enough that I’m afraid it won’t actually start. I bought this car recently from my cousin, who doesn’t have great maintenance records. 
Is this maybe an issue with the fuel pump or fuel filter? Or something else? There don’t seem to be any issues with a rough idle or running poorly otherwise. Thanks for any ideas!"

2012 Fiat 500 won’t start
2nd and 3rd cylinders have no compression (exact reason unknown)

Rough estimate to rebuild/replace engine? I’m in the DC/VA/MD area

Worth it to rebuild? Better off replacing engine? Or just not worth the expense at all? "

Need some help with my 05 V6 Mustang
It’s throwing codes P0193 (Fuel Rail Pressure Sensor High) and P0108 (MAP/Baro pressure circuit high). 
My main question is about the MAP sensor, I’ve read that it’s built into the EGR valve and the whole valve will need replaced. But I’m wondering if the code is caused by a bad sensor or the headers on my car cause I’ve also read that it can be caused by bad catalytic converters but I don’t have any on my car. 

And for the fuel sensor, I’ve read that it can be a nightmare because anything from a faulty connector to the fuel pump can be the culprit, and I’m wanting to know the best way to diagnose it cause I don’t want to start throwing money at it if it won’t fix it.

Any advice/guidance would be greatly appreciated

Car won’t start continues
Okay for context, last week I had trouble starting the car. I changed the battery, battery terminals and starter. It was working g this week until today same problem. Dash turns on, but when I turn the key, I hear a click and everything shuts off with now power. 

I tried jumping, dash turns on, but doesn’t start and turns off. 

Here’s my previous post for details:

https://www.reddit.com/r/CarRepair/s/NDa8WsKiJv

I tried bypassing the ground on the battery to the body of the car (like last time). That doesn’t work. 

I just want to be able to turn it on so I can drive it to the mechanic. 

But I do have a question. Would the alternator prevent the car from starting, even during a jump?

I appreciate any insight

2009 Toyota Camry

I took my Camry out on a drive, I never turned off the car but I put it in park for a couple of minutes and it started jumping. Regardless, I was able to get it home just fine.. acted completely normal even at stops. The next morning I get in it and it won’t start. It’s making a regular start up noise and won’t turn over, so I tried jumping it which didn’t work. I then took my battery to o’rileys for testing but they said that my battery was in good condition. I recently replaced my alternator myself with the help of my dad over the phone, it worked regularly for 2 weeks after so I’m not so sure it’s that. All of my lights turn on, the dash recognizes when i shift gears. I’m at 1/4 tank of gas. I have had previous problems with my spark plugs/coil packs. Even when it starts just fine and the plugs/coils are all replaced it shows an error code for them. I’m not very educated on cars, and I do not have anyone close to me with knowledge of cars willing to look at my car. If you have any idea what the issue may be, please help! Thank you!"

2020 terrain randomly won’t start although battery, alternator, and starter check out.
I have been having an ongoing issue with my 2020 Terrain for about 3 months. 

In July, days after an oil change the transmission started messing up. Few thousand dollars later at AAMCO, new transmission. ( 80,000 miles).

Beginning of September, day after oil change, car wouldn’t start. Jumped it, tested it, battery, starter, alternator all checked OK. Changed the battery in key fob, car still sporadically will not start. Once a week, generally after sitting all night.

Got a new battery, happened again. This is probably the 6th time. At this point, we get it towed to GMC dealer. The car starts right up for them, they can’t seem to see any issues.

Suggestions? They still have it, but I have a feeling they’re not going to find anything. 

** the power goes on, get about 1 click and that’s it, no attempts to turn over or anything**"

Help!! my car won’t start 
Hello,

I am just looking for some answers on what could be happening with my car. I have a 2012 Hyundai accent. I went to go unlock my car today and it wouldn’t unlock. So I manually opened it and tried to start the car. There was no noise or lights on dashboard. Nothing was working or starting. I will also add this car has only been driven maybe 3 or 4 times in the last 4 months. 

Could this be a dead or low battery, if so can I jump start it with another car or do I need to get a new battery? 

If it’s not that battery what else could it be? 
Any advice would be highly appreciated! 

Thank you in advance! "

Valve Question
So cylinder 2 sparkplug shot out and destroyed the bottom part of the ignition coil and stripped the threads, I tried to fix it with the tools I had I put in a new ignition coil in and tried to put in a new sparkplug but it wouldn’t tighten the threads were stripped so I had to drive home which was about 10ish miles away, I kept the ignition coil I’m hoping that it’ll be fine, I started up the vehicle and it started to smoke out of the exhaust, it was white smoke, I then turned off the car and took out the coil and put a thread chaser in the socket instead and made it home with a massive lack of power, I was able to put the new sparkplug in with the new coil to get that fixed however now it smokes for about it 3-4 seconds, misfires from cylinder 2, from my research I found the smoke would be from a valve stem being bad so I went to replace the valve stems when I cracked it open the rocker arm for cylinder 2 was found on the corner not attached so it must have came undone, I replaced all 16 stems and the valve cover gasket.

Main issue:
The issue being now which is why I ask for input when I go to install cylinder 2 rocker arm I am unable to install the valve sits to low about 1/8th inch compared to the rest so when I go to put it on it doesn’t stay on it falls off, I tried to get pliers and move the valve up and it moves a little bit but then when I rotate it about 180 degrees it gets stuck, I’ve been told that valve issues are caused by rocker arm or the lifter being bad but when I try to move the valve to its correct place it won’t go like something is stopping it, I was wondering if anyone knew what could be the cause I don’t think the valve would be bent and I’m hoping it’s not so if anyone has any insight please let me know(and if it’s important it’s a 200 crown Victoria 4.6L engine)"

Car got rear ended. Took it to a collision shop. Took about a month to get fixed. Get into the car for the first time and it was running all weird. 

My bumper was the only thing that needed to be fixed. But for some reason my wheel felt all strange and my car stereo was reset even. After I got hit I drove with my bumper half off for almost 6 miles home with no issue. Car still ran as good as the day I got it. 

Get it back today with the car running all weird didn’t think anything of it because I know
nothing about cars. But it was barely even able to accelerate. An hour later went to get back into my car and it wasn’t starting. Is this normal to happen after them just changing a bumper? Why was my car so reset my stereo was set back to default mode dont get it. "

Brakes tight when car not used for awhile…
So when I don’t use my Jeep grand Cherokee 2019 for a few days, I come back to find the brakes very tight, almost locked up.
Because the push start requires a foot on the brake, I really have to push down HARD, otherwise the car won’t start.

Once the car is started up, brakes are fine and the tightness goes away. 
If I use the car frequently the issue disappears. The issue is only present when I don’t use the car for a few days"

Car turns on but won’t start all of the time
So I have a 2017 Nissan Altima SV. 
Randomly out of nowhere, when I try to start it, my car will turn on (screen turns on, so does the music) but my car isn’t started. This doesn’t happen every time though. Sometimes it starts with no issue. But when it does happen I usually have to restart it a couple-few times for it to work. 
On the dashboard the red battery icon will appear. So I got my battery replaced and now I’m still having the same issue. 
It’s funny because it usually happens when I have my car turned off for a shorter person of time (grocery or gas) but never happens when I have my car turned off for a longer time (8hr work shift or overnight in the garage)
I’m just afraid it eventually will crap out and not start at all. 
Has anyone dealt with anything like this? This is my first car so I’m definitely not a pro in this area.. 
If it’s any help, when I was changing my battery, there was some blue foam (?) around the battery? Would that be caused by anything

2004 F-150, sporadic not starting for over a year now
Hi all, I come in desperate need of someone, anyone, that can explain what’s going on with my dad’s truck. I don’t know where else to go. Looking for either a solution or advice on how to find that solution.

Symptoms:
- Main symptom: randomly won’t start with PATS light flashing
- Happens entirely randomly (more frequently now)
- Only sign that it’s gonna happen is the battery level indicator. When the key it turned to the ON position, if it doesn’t go at least halfway or so, it probably won’t start
- Doesn’t necessarily need a jump to start. Waiting works. Sometimes minutes, hours, days later it will start again. 
- There is also a random dinging in the cab, seems unrelated but might not be. I think it’s for the passenger airbag from online research. 

What’s been done:
- At least 3 new starters
- At least 2 new batteries
- New PATS module last summer
- New PCM installed Friday

The timeline:

- About 3-4 years ago an amateur mechanic put in a new starter. My dad suspects that he messed something up and thinks it’s a “wiring issue” (I’m not as sure). 
- Between then and last summer: new starters, batteries and alternator. During one of those trips, one of the techs at a non-Ford shop asked my dad if his windshield was leaking because he found some corroded wires, but I assume fixed them. 
- Last summer: finally decided to look into it and thought the issue was the PATS system as others had similar issues. Got it into Ford. They weren’t able to recreate it, but agreed probably PATS and put in a new module.
- Last fall: happened again, Ford couldn’t recreate it and sent him home without doing anything.
- Few weeks ago: really ramped up in frequency. Got it into Ford, they kept it until they could recreate it and scanner apparently told them PCM. After ordering PCM online, they replaced it Friday. 
- Started Sat, Sun, Mon but didn’t drive it. Drove it today, about 5 hours after turning it off it wouldn’t start again. Battery level indicator was a bit low. Waited 15 mins and it started up. 

TLDR; ‘04 F150 randomly won’t start with PATS light flashing. Replaced a few starters, batteries, alternator, PATS Module and PCM. Looking for solutions/advice. Thanks!"

2011 Dodge Nitro TIPM fried?
We put a 2” lift kit on my son’s 2011 Dodge Nitro.  Part of getting to everything was taking out the fuse box & TIPM.  After everything was put back together the vehicle is totally dead until you turn the key to the on position.  No power to the overhead lights, locks, radio to keep the time & presets, etc.  Nothing works until you turn the key to the on position. It will start and drive fine, but the power locks still won’t work.  We’ve replaced a few of the fuses, checked the grounding wires, and nothing has changed.  Is it possible the TIPM got fried or is there something else I’m missing?

URGENT DIAGNOSIS - CAR STALLING OUT
2005 Mercedes-Benz C240 [W203]

I’m having an issue with my car where it will keep randomly stalling out after running for a good while, once the engine temperature heats up (not overheating). And then it won’t start back up and when you turn the key it will still click just not fire, and because of the way the Mercedes’ is it clicks a bunch of times until key is pulled out. And then about an hour after sitting there it will start back up and run fine for a little bit and then start the same thing all over again.

Some things to take note of:

Put in a brand new fuel pump
Replaced fuel filter 
Brand new battery
There has been no dead battery, or low power, no dim lights
The ignition clicks every single time
Ignition will fire no problem, only after the car stalls will it not fire, but once it cools down or about roughly an hour, ignition clicks and fires no problem
And this may not be relevant but just dropped 20” speewell rims on it with low pros 😝"

Tailgate Door Opening Problem
So I have a 2012 Vauxhall/Opel Meriva and a couple of months ago it started having problems with opening the tailgate before eventually it just wouldn’t open at all. Found out that the Body Control Module was the culprit and the mechanic recommended that rather than get that repaired which is expensive I could ask an auto electrician to rewire the tailgate to bypass the module.

Few weeks later I had one out and he found that while the body control module was a problem, also the switch on the door was too worn down. So he wired the door up to a switch in the dashboard. Now I have to hit that switch to release the tailgate, however, it usually takes two people because if you’re not pulling it open as it is released the weight of the door is likely to get it back down into a position where it is not quite shut properly but also won’t open. So one person hits the switch as the other pulls it open. Obviously frustrating when on your own.

A solution I thought of was to attach a spring to the inside of the tailgate at the edge which can be flat enough to allow it to close but which will push it out when opened so one person can use the switch by themselves. What I don’t know is what kind of spring would work best for this or even how to find that out. If there’s any better solutions I’d be happy to hear about those too…"

Vw golf sunroof leak
Volkswagen Sunroof Leak

Attention VW techs and any and all car mechanics! 
I drive a 2017 VW Golf. Last year, my sunroof started to drain near the rear view mirror. Went to dealership service center. They told me the sunroof frame was cracked and it would take six months for the part to come and cost about $2k. I agreed to the service and in the meantime was super diligent about covering my car as I don’t have a garage. Finally the part comes and they install it. Just about three months later, there are leaks on the top front  sides of the car. I am very familiar with VWs issue with leaky sunroofs and know that those two side drains need to be unclogged using that special tool that looks like a snake drain thing with a brush on the end. Before the sunroof frame incident I was pretty good about cleaning those side drains every couple months. So, I clean the drains using the tool and noticed the tool didn’t come out the other end on the bottom of the car as it typically does. Happened on both sides. So knew something was up already. I then did the water test where you pour water in those top two holes to make sure it’s unclogged and was hoping to see the after drain out the bottom. Instead the water went right inside the car near where the driver and passenger feet would be. Happened on both sides. Take it back to the dealership thinking clearly this has something to do with how they installed the sunroof frame. They told me it’s likely the drains are just old and/or damaged and it coincidentally happened so soon after having the frame replaced. They said it would cost $900, mostly for labor, to open everything up and see if the drains are damaged OR if there was damage as a result of how the frame was installed in which case I won’t have to pay for the work. My question is, is it likely/feasible/possible that those drains were damaged during the frame installation?  If so, how would they be able to tell? I just don’t want to pay to have them open it all up and tell me “nope just damaged drain” or “you must have punctured both sides with the tool” and then fork over $900 for the repair. It’s just too coincidental that this happens just a couple months after having the sunroof frame replaced and I’ve used that tool a bunch of times prior to clear out those drains. The photo is the estimate and the pic the mechanic took to try and show me what he could see without having to do the four hours of $900 labor. 

I should note too that it took them over two weeks to replace the frame because during installation they broke these little clips and had to wait for them to be delivered. That tells me there was sketchy stuff happening during the frame installation. 

Any advice/thoughts appreciated!!!!  "

2016 Nissan Rogue window motor problem
Hey! I am having a difficult time finding this part. Our 2016 Nissan Rogue rear driver side window was rolled down and then stopped working with all switches. Other windows are fine. 

We narrowed it down to the motor, removed it and started looking for parts. I thought it would be easy, but there are six pin and two pin options for the same car, and the prices range from decent to over $500. Every time I think I find a matching part online, it’s a two pin connector, when I need a six. The best matches are always the incredibly high priced OEM parts from dealerships. 

I don’t even care about a workout window, I just want the window up, but it won’t stay up without the assembly and motor working. It’s driving me nuts. I’ve posted photos of the whole assembly,  if even the motor alone would be fine. You can see the six pins in the photos.

Thank you in advance for any assistance! I’m in the Austin, TX area."

Removed the dead car battery positive terminal first
My car battery died out a few days ago so the car won’t start at all, and the engine hood lift support was also broken so I had to remove the battery with a single hand. I mistakenly removed the positive terminal first…then the negative terminal was loosened but stuck there. So I left it over there…now I read that I should’ve disconnected the negative terminal first for safety reason…

Question is tomorrow, should I reconnect back the positive terminal then remove the negative terminal? Or it is still ok if I continue to remove the negative terminal with a flat screwdriver?

My 2015 Malibu Needs help
So first off I wanna get this out of the way, it’s not the alternator, battery stays alive and charges while running.

So my 2015 Malibu is having issues. It won’t turn on without a jump and dies once turned off. We replaced the “relays” idk what they’re actually called but the thing that goes over the battery but that didn’t work. Something is draining the battery and we think it’s the small secondary battery in the trunk. We also know when the battery is fully charged when we jump it we have to connect it to the relays to get it to start. Is it the small battery and the relays or is there another issue?"

How screwed am I? (Car carpet found flooded after 4 few days)
So, about a week ago I discovered the floor of my car was soaked. Like so soaked I could push on the carpets in my backseat and see a puddle of water. 

Issue started when I had taken it to Firestone for an inspection and to get a lower control arm replacement, and somehow in the process my sunroof was open a tiny crack unknown to my knowledge (I don’t use it ever).

When I found the water in the carpet, it had been raining a and this water had been sitting in my floor for about 3-4 days at this point before I knew the floor was wet. It seemed to mostly be on the backseat floor. 

I’ve been very attentive to it, but because it’s been cold and rainy in LA for the last two weeks my car hasn’t had the ability to try out. 

I’ve done a lot to try to get the water out. Specifically the first day I blotted out all the water on top with towels and spent 6 hours blow drying it. That seemed to dry most of the top of the carpet,  it feeling it wasn’t enough, the next day I rented a wet vacuum and spent 3-4 hours sucking out all the water I can rotating through the seats of the car sucking up water from the floor. 

Tried rice on the floor which is what my friend who is a mechanic said, but it didn’t seem to absorb enough from inside the foam under the carpet. 

This whole time I’ve had Damp Rid hung in my car so it can absorb as much moisture from the air as possible. 

At this point my car feels mostly cleaner and dry, but I can tell in one portion of the carpet I can lift up that the foam under my carpet is wet. 

The carpet at this point isn’t getting any more wet than it is. The temperatures haven’t exceeded 80 degrees lately so hopefully it’s not warm enough for extensive mildew or mold to grow. 

I don’t see any external signs of mold of mildew growing. 

In you experience, how fucked am I? Is it most likely that all this work I do won’t be enough. It’s supposed to be overcast and rainy here the next few days. I’m hoping to avoid any mold or mildew growth. What I’d love is for it to be super hot and dry (as it normally is in LA), but not this time of year. 

I figure if it doesn’t get better soon I’m going to have to make an insurance flood claim and pay $1,000 deductible. But I don’t want to overreact either. It seems this happens to a lot of people for various reasons and ideally most or many of them can dry out their cars before it’s too late. 

What do you think? At this point it’s only the foam under the floor I need to dry. Is it likely too late 1-2 weeks in if it’s been rainy and cold? I think mold/mildew usually requires warmer temperatures to grow."

Possible ignition cylinder issue
I have 2015 Patriot, and for the past week or so every time I put the key in to start the vehicle the key won’t turn. I have to keep rocking my steering wheel back and forth for it to eventually unlock/turn. I finally was able to to take it to the shop I typically go to and turns out they said it will have to go to a dealership to be replaced because something in it has to be reprogrammed. So as frustrating as this is, I’m wondering if anyone else has encountered this issue? As well as if anyone knows what something like this may cost to fix?"

Advice would be much appreciated RE: Tire Pressure Sensor
Hi everyone, I have a car repair question I’m hoping for some clarity on. I’ve tried googling but not coming up with definitive answers.

I bought a 2009 Nissan Versa about three years ago. The Check Engine light has been on the entire time I’ve had the car; each time I have the code read, its about tire pressure but no further details. Once the code is wiped, the check engine light turns off but comes back on about a week later.

My tire pressure sensor light usually kicks on about this time of year as it gets colder outside, which happened a couple days before thanksgiving. Stupidly I didn’t air up before taking a trip to a nearby town on Thanksgiving with my boyfriend. During the trip, which was probably 100 miles all around, my tire pressure light started flashing which has never happened before. We aired up at the destination as there were no nearby gas stations.

My boyfriend did that part, he said he aired all four up to 30 PSI. On the way back to town, the tire pressure light continued to stay on and would flash sometimes. BF did not look at the cold pressure reading for my tires, so the next day I aired them all up myself to 33 each, which is the recommended cold pressure. The tire pressure light stayed on even after that. 

It flashes when I start the car for a minute, then stays solid. From what I’m seeing, that means one of the pressure sensors has failed- that’s what all the symptoms suggest. So I anticipated getting a repair estimate soon, but last night, the sensor light was no longer on or flashing, and my always-present check engine light was still on. At the last stop of my errands last night, my tire pressure light again started flashing on startup and stayed solid. It’s continued to do so today.

Why would it go off and then come back on? If the sensor is failing, won’t it continue to flash and stay on indefinitely? Or is there something else this could be? I really appreciate your advice in advance, I love this car and I want to keep it going as long as I can!!"

2016 - i10 - timing belt
Hello! Looking for some advice on what our next move should be as I think our car is a write off. 

It’s not been driving well and the engine light has been on for a while. 

Took it to the mechanics about a month ago. They ran a diagnostic and flagged it as a timing belt issue. 

We bit the bullet and put it in for a repair. They ended up cleaning the cam shaft sensors instead. We were told this would mean it will drive better. 

However the engine light came back on straight away and now we’re told the back brakes have seized and need replaced. 

They did that and now it won’t start as the timing belt has gone. 

The car is worth about 3k maybe. 64,000 miles on the clock. A few scratches here and there. 

Do we scrap the car? 
What is a fair price. 
Does this all sound legit? 


Thanks"

No check engine light car randomly stalls at idle and intermittently won’t start. At mechanic shop
Update: they initially couldn’t reproduce. Me being paranoid had them replace the cam and crankshaft sensors for oem ones just in case.

After the sensor swap they did a test drive and it died. Turned out to be the fuel pump. They measured the fuel pressure. Pump is under warranty and they will replace.

Car is 2006 Nissan Altima. Going to ask the if the fuel tank looks dirty or if the filter on the old pump looked clogged.


They said cars as old as mine doing throw codes for loss of fuel pressure so it wouldn’t code.

———

Car is at the mechanic shop, but they can’t reproduce the engine start problem.

Had a full tank of gas mixed with fuel stabilizer prior and it ran through the whole tank to a quarter tank just fine. When it reached near empty but still above the last empty line and before low gas light appeared it stalled out at a stop light.

Wouldn’t turn back on. Thought I ran out of gas or the fuel stabilizer mix diluted the fuel.

So I put some gas after a tow. Problem seemed fixed. Drove on and off most  of the day no issues.

Later in the day failed to start. No check engine light. Fuel pump was replaced 7 months ago. 

Anything I should ask them to try? Maybe fuel injector cleaning? They say no misfires currently. Car is a 2006 with lots of maintainer work done. Injectors are original and currently at 160,000 miles"

Car is having electrical issues, I don’t know if it’s all related.
I have a 2009 Nissan Rogue and it’s an overall piece of crap but it’s a piece of crap that we’ve been able to repair with minimal cost and it runs. I plan on driving this thing until the wheels fall off. 

However, one thing I haaaaaate about this car is that we’ve been having issues with my audio system, it wouldn’t stay connected unless I dismantled my dash, took the power cord out and put it back in. It would work for 2-3 weeks at a time. It was annoying but I knew I could fix it temporarily, until one day it just wouldn’t turn on again. 

We bought a new audio system, same thing. It won’t work at ALL. I asked the folks over at the car av subreddit and they gave great suggestions but unfortunately it was all suggestions my husband had already tried. I just listen to music on my phone now and figured I’d just deal with it. 

Then, a few months ago, my cigarette lighter/charging port thing stopped working. Same situation. If I jiggled my charger a little bit, it would work until I had to leave the car and start it again. Rinse and repeat until a few weeks of that turned into it not working completely. Not the end of the world, but really inconvenient when I need to charge my phone. I adjust accordingly now and make sure I have a full charge before going anywhere and I bring my normal charger with me in case of emergencies. 

Finally, my cruise control stopped working and when I hit the cancel button trying to see if any of the buttons worked/were stuck/smashing buttons out of desperation, it honked my horn. I didn’t push it hard, just a tap. And it continued to do so every time I pushed the button, until one day it didn’t. So now my cruise control has petered out. Lights don’t show up on the dash, and it doesn’t activate at all. 

I’m not car savvy AT ALL save for being able to dismantle my dash to “fix” my audio system. My husband is very car savvy but he’s so overwhelmed with other projects at our house and at work that when I talk to him about this, I’d like to present solutions to him rather than hit him with a bunch of questions. 

My questions for y’all are: 

1) are these related? Could it be that my electrical system is just going to shit? 

2) if we take it to a mechanic, would this be an expensive job? I live in SW MO for reference, I know cost of services vary by location. I also know and understand that this is a very vague picture of what’s going on and that any suggestions of cost are simply suggestions and could vary based on what’s actually wrong with it. 

3) are there possibly any other explanations for what’s going on or do I just need to suck it up until it finally dies? 

I don’t need any of these things to get from point A to point B, and I don’t take this car on road trips (it will try to strand me, it’s personal at this point) so I don’t “need” cruise control. This car has many other mechanical issues right now but the three issues I’ve presented are the ones that have us frustrated. 

I can try and answer any further questions, but my scope of knowledge is limited and my husband is at work and prob won’t be able to answer until later tonight. I will absolutely try though. 

Thanks in advance!"

2003 Jeep Liberty
Alright, so I’ve had this issue for a while now. I’ve had a few mechanics look but without enough money they just say it could be a hundred different things. Obviously lol anyway, had a bad rain one day and it got washed down a hill. I turned it off while it was a lot underwater. It worked fine after for a bit  and then one day it refused to start. Now, the engine won’t turn over with the key. I started with the basics. Swapped the battery, the starter, and the alternator. I’ve checked fuses and relays. Everything seems fine there. However, I can pull the starter relay out and put in a piece of wire to bypass the relay and it turns over. Obviously not the brightest idea but oh well. I went and got a new one just in case. Still won’t start. I’m thinking its probably the ignition switch or the actuator pin. Not sure if they’re attached or not. So I guess I’m looking for a second opinion before I start taking it apart again. Also, I need a new grommet for the air intake housing (on the passenger side of the engine if it matters) because it broke pretty much in half, which makes it harder to find the correct one. So if anybody knows which one I need I’d appreciate the help. Thanks in advance for anything to help"

2012 Chevy Cruze cooling fan issues
Hello everyone. So I have a 2012 Chevy Cruze with the 1.8 engine, 115k miles. Lately I’ve noticed it running pretty warm if it’s warm outside and I’m sitting with the car running for more than a few seconds, the radiator fan isn’t kicking on so the engine will run between 200 and 226 degrees a lot. And the AC won’t run as cold as it should be. I just got the condenser replaced and the AC serviced last summer. I do know that i can hear the fan relays clicking and the fan will try to turn on but seems like something is stopping it, if I give it a good smack in the middle of the fan, it’ll run like it should for a few minutes then just goes right back to doing what it did before. I’m thinking just putting a new fan assembly in it would fix the issue seeing as everything else seems to be working besides the fan itself and it does work for a short time if it gets started a little bit. Just trying to make sure I don’t waste money on something that isn’t likely to fix this issue. Any advice would be greatly appreciated. Thanks!"

2014 Chrysler Town and Country starting is slow.
Had an issue with starting about 2 months ago. Just died. It was super cold and the battery was about 6 years old. Got it jumped and got a new battery. Started just fine. It threw a code and they said it was an under volt but once new battery was on the code went away. 

2 months later, won’t start and light came on. I have a power pack that I jumped it with. Drove for about 45 minutes. Went to start it again about 10 hours later I hit the ignition and nothing but instead of jumping it right away (all the lights were on and electrical seemed ok) I pushed the ignition again and it wanted to start. Pushed it a 3rd time and it finally turned over but really slowly.

There was no clicking.

Brakes grinding after quote
2018 Audi s4 

My brake light came on so I went to Audi and they told me I have 2mm in the rear and around 8mm in the front…of course they charge an insane amount for any repairs so I decided to get a quote elsewhere. I took the car to a German garage and they told me I have 1mm on the back and 3-4mm on the front. I was very skeptical of the mechanic after he provided such a different measurement. I decided to order my own brake kit from ECS Tuning and have a mechanic install them. 
The day after this German mechanic checked my brakes I went out of town and so I did not drive the car for about 5-6 days. When I started it up this morning, I drove about 2 feet before shutting off the car because of loud grinding sounds. I’m wondering why this is happening. I’m not sure if that mechanic did something in order to expedite my need for brakes or if they put them back on incorrectly.


My main concern is…when my brakes come in in 10 days, will I be able to drive to a mechanic to get them installed? (I certainly won’t be touching the car until then)"

Battery Advice
I haven’t been driving my car much since Covid. I may go 2 weeks or more without driving it. A few months ago I went to drive my car and it was completely dead. I was able to jump it and was on my way. I ended up having to jump it a few times the past few months. I went to jump it about 2 months ago and it would not jump. I took the battery to autozone and said the battery was bad. I purchased a battery that was around $175 with 2 year warranty. After I purchased my car sat for 3 weeks. I went to drive and my battery was dead. I thought that a new battery would not die within 3 weeks. I purchased a boost jump device from Amazon and it would not start my car. I had someone use regular jumper cables and my car still wouldn’t start. I replaced the boost jumper and it worked. Car started right up. But after starting, before I could even get out to remove the device my car died and all interior lights went off. I unplugged the boost and restarted my car. I sat there for like 5 minutes revving the engine hoping it wouldn’t die. It was fine. Since my battery is dead after 2-3weeks, is this normal? Or could the new battery be bad? I’ve jumped cars before but never see a car that completely died after a jump. It’s so dead that even my interior lights won’t stay on. Should I warranty out this battery. Thanks for any advice."

2014 Edge, 4500 miles, long history of won’t start
Greetings﻿. We really need some help with our 2014 Ford Edge. We have taken it to the dealer many times and spent several thousand dollars in the last seven years for electrical issues--but the issues have never been fixed. 
 
The low mileage is because it’s always broken but the mechanic is telling me it’s always broken because we don’t drive it enough. Since we've bought it, we replaced the spark plugs at 1,533 miles, the battery at 2510 miles, a relay at 3326 miles, the FCIM at 3600 miles, another battery and a fuse at 4360 miles, anot﻿her fuse at 4375 miles, and another battery at 4450 miles.
 
Inspite of all these repairs and regular maintenance, the vehicle isn't starting. Again. The dealer is recommending replacing the smart junction box and the HCU and ECU ABS modules. 
 ﻿﻿
I’m banging my head on the advis﻿﻿or’s desk asking him to look at this holistic﻿ally—this isn’t normal that a car (even one that’s ﻿﻿seven years old) has so many problems of this type. Last time we replaced the battery, they told me THAT was the reason it wasn’t starting. They rolled their eyes when I told them the dead battery was just a symptom of a larger problem. 
 ﻿
So I’m not sure if they’re playing darts with their diagnoses, or maybe they’re recommending replacing the smart junction box because they know it’s out of stock nation wide, or if they legitimately diagnosed the problem this t﻿ime. 
 
A complicating factor might be that it’s a US-spec car but we don’t live in America. anyone got any suggestions?"

Toyota Rav 4 repair
Hi all. I need some help/advice.

My Toyota Rav 4 2.2 diesel recently broke down. Had it recovered and booked in to a garage for diagnostics/repair.

No 1 injector was leaking and have had the Injector replaced with a genuine Toyota injector. 

However, the garage that done the repair have said that they could not finish doing the coding of the injector. The injector was coded but they were unable to do the pilot settings and that it is locked to main dealer. Said he tried to do it on 3 different machines.

I have been to Toyota and they have said it could take 2 hours to do and there’s no guarantee they would be able to do and that it could take longer and I would be liable to charges even if they can’t do it. I don’t want to pay 2+ hours at main dealer rates when there’s no guarantee they can even do it. They also said that the garage I had it done at should be able to do it and that it’s not locked to main dealer. Was also told that the car might not run properly without it being done and that it could go into limp mode.

The car seems to be driving ok, but I have only driven a mile or so since the repair.

So the question is, do I need to get this done? Will it cause any issue if I don’t? Why have the mains dealer said they can’t guarantee they can do it? Is it not just a case of plugging in a machine and pressing a few buttons to code it? 

I hope this all makes sense, I don’t really know too much about cars."

Weird creaking sound after front spring replacement (Mazda 323 (BF), 1989)
Half a week ago I replaced both front coil springs on my 1989 Mazda 323 BF. The right one was broked, but I changed both of them.

Unfortunately, a creaking noise has appeared from the right side after this, which I'm unable to pinpoint the cause of. It happens when the suspension is compressed/released, and you can actually feel it in the spring itself. It does NOT happen when turning the steering wheel. I've filmed every bushing and ball joint to see if there's play in them and I've checked that every nut and bolt I loosened has been torqued down again. I can't find any play in anything. The sound can not be heard when driving (no matter the quality of the road). It can only be heard sometimes when going really slow (walking pace) and hitting some unevenness on the road.

What in the world can this be? I noticed in my video that the top of the spring sort of ""rotates"" when compressed. I'm not sure if that's normal behavior for a coil spring, but it's the only thing I've found that I'd consider a bit off.

Any ideas?"

What would cause the gauges on the dash to all flip to the left/stop reading suddenly while driving, followed by the Jeep beginning to simultaneously lurch and start stalling out, before losing all power and ""dying""?
I have a 2001 Jeep Wrangler Sport and know nothing about auto repair, nor do I have the money to take the Jeep to a mechanic right now. The gauges on the dash all flipped to the left and stopped displaying anything very suddenly, while I was on the highway. That was accompanied by a loud beeping noise, off and on, for the next few miles. Then, the Jeep seemed like it was losing power and slowing down, and as it began to come to a crawl, the vehicle began lurching and trying to stall out, at the same time.

(Edit to add information: The Jeep has a new battery, new battery cables and posts, and a new alternator.)

I'm sorry if my description is not more detailed or technical. My husband of thirty years was the one who maintained our vehicles, until I discovered that he was having multiple affairs and running up thousands of dollars in debt and confronted him, at which time he left to go play house with his affair partners, leaving me broke, driving an old beater with major issues. (The frame was also rusted out and when I was able to take it to a mechanic months ago, I was told that it was a death trap and the transmission could drop any time, if I went over rough terrain or simply hit a big enough bump. My soon-to-be-ex husband confirmed that, when I texted to ask if that was accurate.)

I was/am content driving my Jeep and need to do what I can to fix it. But, I have no idea what the issue is and no local family or friends who can help, now that my husband betrayed and abandoned me. I can get a book on the Jeep and try to repair whatever the issue is, once I know. But, I need to know what the problem actually is... and I am NOT knowledgeable about vehicles. So, I am desperate for help and came to Reddit to see if anyone would recognize the issue(s), so I have a starting point to work from. Please let me know if you need more information in order to help. Thanks in advance for any information or suggestions!"

What car brand to buy after my car broke down?
Hello,

Yesterday, my Mazda cx5 2.2 diesel 2014 broke down & today I found out that the gear box is kaboom. The estimate is over my head & the only thing I can afford is to buy something on installments otherwise ko car no job for me. Mazda cx5 was biggest mistake of my life & it just pushed me further into loans.

Would love to know what car brand you suggest after bearing in mind I drive about 40-50000 km/year.

Thanks. "

19` Volkswagen Jetta, Passenger Blender Actuator isn't working properly.
Hi peoples, I've never owned anything this new... My Jetta seems to have a bad blender actuator. Using a Temperature sensor, I verified that my passenger side vents blow air at the same temperature as the outside, unless its called for heat, then it will actuate and blow HOT air. It was 83 degrees today, and my ac was not cooling me off. The drivers side was cooler on the far left then it was in the middle and the passenger side got hotter towards the passenger door. I've skimmed the internet for instructional videos or diagrams but to no avail, does anybody have any tips for accessing the actuators for further diagnosis. Im scared im gonna manhandle the ""seamless"" plastic too much and break something.

UPDATE: It was In fact the refrigerant level, I broke down and purchased a $95 10 ounce bottle of the 1234YF.
And in minutes I was blowing fifty degree air from all vents. Ai chat was also a great help in finding diagrams and service manuals that have leaked from the pay wall. Thank you!"

Replacing Starter on 2017 Nissan Rouge
We ran into an issue on the road and had issues with the vehicle at night.  Couldn't really look at it because we were broke down at night so we had the towed to a nearby Auto Repair shop.  My question is if there is any reason why they would quote us so much for a new starter.  They quoted us $1400+.  I haven't replace a starter in a vehicle for a while and wasn't sure if their are computer related reasons for the high cost or if they are just highballing here."

High Pressure Fuel Pump - Strange Happenings
This is a follow up to my previous post here...I am kind of confused at this point.

Short of it, 2020 VW Atlas with the turbo 4cyl. Went to merge into traffic so I had to get on the throttle to move this turbo 4cyl...it rev'd way higher than usual and then settled down, but now I had a noise, handful of hours later, I am now in limp mode and an EPC and Check Engine light. ODB Scanner says HPFP not moving fuel.

I bought this car 3 years ago, roughly, from an Audi dealership with about 10500 miles on it. I havent put may miles on it in that time, but enough. It currently has about 32K. I dove a little deeper and went to remove this old HPFP yesterday...when I took the engine cover off, the thing wasnt even bolted in. Im not sure what the story is, but it appears like at some point, someone replaced this already. After getting the pump off, I thought, maybe its not even bad, maybe when I rev'd hard, it put it under pressure and came unseated since it wasnt bolted down. I went and bought bolts and was going to remount it to see if it resolved the issue...That is when I found out, one of the old bolts was sheared off about halfway down in the mounting hole...the other was just missing completely.

Did someone try and mount this, broke off the bolt, and just panicked and put it back together?

Would a hard rev to 6K put this thing under enough pressure to dislodge or shear 2 8mm, 32mm long bolts? Seems highly unlikely, but also seems unlikely a previous repair would have left it like this.

Im just sort of baffled at this point."

My 2019 Hyundai Tucson broke down 2 weeks ago and I have no idea why. please PLEASE help.
I just need some opinions on what could possibly be going on here. I apologize, I’m just a 19 y/o girl and I know absolutely nothing about cars but this has been the most stressful and enraging 2 weeks of my life so bear with me. 2 weeks ago my 2019 Hyundai Tucson broke down on the side of the road. As I was driving my speed suddenly started declining and the battery and oil lights came on in red. After I turned it off it would not crank and was making a knocking noise when we would try to crank it. The mechanic who towed it looked at it and told us it had no oil in it and probably needed a new engine. also had metal shaving where the oil goes. it’s been sitting at his shop for 2 weeks. he hasn’t looked at it again or tried to put oil in it or anything and we’re trying to have it towed to a dealership. I’m so confused because it never gave me an oil light or had any indication of an oil leak. The engine had started to sound different but it was so barely noticeable I was going to wait til my boyfriend could look at it later that week. My boyfriend typically changes my oil but we had an oil change place change it 3 months ago because we were busy. We always keep up with my oil changes and do them on time. I am so lost and stressed. I can’t wait any longer to get answers I just want to know what’s wrong with my car and if I’ll have to buy a new engine. I’m currently trying to move and it’s already tight with the car note and insurance and everything and I’m terrified that if it is the engine and we refinance the car it’s going to be so much more expensive. I’m so stressed I feel sick. I need opinions. 

edit: if it helps the car has 93k miles and i put about 500 miles on it a week ! I drive it a TON. I drive 35 miles to work and back 4 days a week and about 115 miles and back to see my boyfriend weekly. "

Just had brakes fixed and they are 'going out' but my question is.......
Paid $500 for new brakes and I honestly, knowing so little about it, I assume whatever else you get for a ""brake job"".  A month later I'm going down the mountain and they barely work and pressed all the way to the floor still creeping forward at the red light. Had to get a hotel because I can't go back to my campsite and risk coming back down again.

Obviously I'm taking it back to the place that did the work today but what I'm wondering is, well, the 4Runner started rumbling over 50mph about a week and half ago. I don't know how else to say it. Just riding really really rough, enough that it's unbearable to drive it that fast.

I just had the brake work, all new tires, and the ujoints replaced.

So my question is, since my brakes are now going out I'm wondering if that could have been causing the roughness and rumbling going over 50mph? I just want to go in there was SOME kind of information.

Please help. I have no people in this city and I'm afraid I'm going to go broke trying to get out.

One more thing. I was told this was nothing but a week after all this work was done I heard something that sounded like a rock hit underneath. It was fairly loud. The 4Runner is up higher than normal and I never heard that before. So I kind of forgot about it and then the sound happened again days later. I took it somewhere and they said they don't see anything.

So there is all the info. I really appreciate any help. I've already paid more than the thing is worth but I'm scared of getting a ""lemon"" by buying a used vehicle. I'm so stuck.

Hi I had to take the valve body down on my 6r80 transmission, and I noticed a valve retainer clip was broke, I know its still holding it in place, should I replace the clip or throw it back together as is. I'm not sure how hard it is to replace the clip I may have to split the valve body, can I squeeze it in without splitting the valve body?

Car broke down 2 days after purchase from dealership 
I bough a 2016 BMW from a dealership, car as was sold as is. The guy at the dealership who sold me the car told me the car had no issues at all, and how great of a car it was. He said he personally drove the car and it was great. I test drove the car before purchasing and everything seemed fine. I paid $9000 cash for it and bought it in full. 2 days later I was getting an engine light on and a messsge saying “drive-train malfunction, service as soon as possible”. I took the car to BMW to get the serviced and they told me the car needed an entire new engine and quoted me $22,000. They said the based on the VIN my car was previously serviced at their location and whoever owned the car then was told to replace the engine, and that was 2-3 years ago. Apparently the engine was never replaced with a new one and the car was sold. Within 3 years the car had only been driven under 2000k miles. We know this because the car was serviced at BmW previously it had 130,000 miles on, 3 years later when I brought the car to them the car had 132,000 miles on the odometer. The dealership told me a lot of times smaller dealerships will get a mechanic to reset the cars computers to turn off the engine light, but eventually after driving so many miles the engine light will cut back on and you’ll have the same issues. I say this to say when I test drive the car, obviously I didn’t drive the car long enough for the engine light to come back on to warn me that the car has issues. I informed the dealership of the issue and they said it had nothing to do with them and it’s nothing they can do about because I bought it “as is” . They then told me to get a second opinion and take it to the shop next door to them who works specifically on European Cars and who previously serviced the car before they had it on their car lot. The dealer I bought the car from, purchased the car from the European car repair shop next door to them and then they sold it to me. 
Now the shop told me they can put used rebuilt engine in it for around 4-5k which is much better than 22k as BMW quoted me. I asked the dealership if they can at least go half on the repairs with me which they refused. I’m really upset and disappointed because this happened within 48hrs of me purchasing the car from them. What can I do in this situation? Do I have any rights legally to pursue a civil claim ?"

Loud humming noise after replacing front struts
My nephew, not a mechanic by trade but is good with cars, replaced my front struts and link bar a few weeks ago. The first time I drove it, I noticed that it stopped the clunking sound every time I hit a bump, but as an added bonus, there is a loud humming sound when I drive. I was on the parkway when I first noticed it and I thought there was a motorcycle next to me or a car with a loud muffler, until I broke away and I was the only one around.

My first thought was a wheel bearing, though it is strange that this happened immediately after changing the struts. I lifted the car and tried the shimmy the tires up and down and left and right and there was no play so I think I can rule out the bearings. My tires were ready to be replaced so I got 4 new tires, hoping it was the slight uneven wear on the inner tires that were causing the noise. Not that.  I could get an alignment but I am worried that if I do, and that doesn't fix the problem, a mechanic will need to do whatever needs to be done and then pay for a 2nd alignment. 

  
Any ideas what could cause this? It is a loud humming sound, almost as if something is rubbing, yet when I have the car jacked up and I turn the tires, I hear nothing rubbing. The pitch of the sound gets higher and lower with speed.  Definitely not the engine. My nephew has done this job before on his and my wife's car with no issues. Something is different this time"

Broken seat belt: mechanic, body shop, or DIY?
Not entirely sure how this happened.  When I bought the car a few years ago, the seatbelt buckle was above the seat where it should be, so I didn't notice anything wrong.  But there were other signs the car had been in an accident and was damaged around here (front passenger side).  At some point the buckle fell down below the seat, and I realized it was not properly attached.  I'm not sure if it has been like this the whole time, or if I somehow broke it.  Anyway, is this a job for a body shop or a mechanic?  Or is it a reasonably easy repair that I could do myself?  The car is a 2009 Honda Fit.

Stuck bolt that’s completely rusted through
I just took out my catalytic converter and I had some trouble with the bolts connecting down below, I ended up having to use a deep socket bolt extractor to get them off. when I got off one it broke the bolt and it never actually got the direct nut off the bolt it was rusted around and through the gasket as well so it came off like a chunk you feel me? So not it’s the back of the bolt and a little of it sticking out, there’s no way I can get this bolt out unless I use like acid or sum to remove the rust and there’s no leeway to grab it to turn or anything. I’m thinking of getting some clamp a bolt to use but I’m not sure that’s gonna change anything unless I get something to flatten that roughness to seal the gasket.

The back of the bolt is completely flattened out so it’s like a flat headed bolt.

The bolt is rusted like one big rust bolt so not only is the original bolt attached to the gasket the rust is holding it tg as well.

When I got the old bolt and nut off it snapped and the nut is rusted to the piece I took off so now it’s only half a bolt through the gasket 


Any thoughts ideas or solutions? I’m open to any criticism and conversation 

Here are some photos I was able to take or get a clip of while I was working on it earlier "

Brake issue causes other issues
I'm wondering if the auto shop should be held more responsible & help with costs.  
 Here's the story -  I recently had rear brakes replaced, whole 9 yards... as well as some other repairs it came out to $2,000.00.  5 weeks after the brake job, the rear passenger brakes failed. The wheel was grinding and lurching because a bolt on the caliper broke and caused the car to be un-drivable. Luckily I could pull over and have it towed back to the same shop. I had no idea what was wrong at the time.   
Because of this caliper braking, it damaged the inside of my wheel causing it to crack in several spots. Therefore the wheel is ruined and my tire went completely flat. The tire then HAS to be replaced because it was sitting on a flat spot before the shop could look at it. 

The shop tells me I have to get a replacement wheel (so I got one from the scrap yard), and pay to replace the tire. But they said the tire is old and bald - THAT is why it is flat and needs replacement. The tire was not bald, sure it was older and would need replacing soon, but it still had some life left. They were holding air fine before, I have not had to refill them, there was no slow leak or anything like that.  They fixed the brake issue for free, since it's still under warranty. 

I just looked at the wheel today, and it's very clear to me the brake issue caused the cracks in the wheel. He swore up and down they were not related, and it just was happen chance my tire went flat after the brakes broke. 

  
We argued and even though he said they're unrelated incidents, he gave me $20.00 off and some warranty on the tire for free, but he still was very adamant the brake fail had nothing to do with the wheel & tire fail. thanks in advance -- So what do y'all think? should the ship be held liable for the wheel and tire? just the wheel?

Very tight hex nut location
https://imgur.com/a/Qc3BTej

2011 Hyundai Santa Fe limited 6 cyl AWD

Two hex nuts shown here are 14mm.  They hold down the bracket for the stabilizer bar bushings that i want to replace.  This is at the front left wheel 

I can fit a socket onto them but not the wrench because the head of the wrench is too big with a short socket, and the metal brake lines interfere with a longer socket.  I tried a flexible/spring socket extension but that broke because the nuts are on tight.  Not enough room for an open end wrench to swing, and a rachet/open end wrench also doesn't fit down on the nut.

If there was a 3/8"" or 1/2"" square bar with a 90° turn in it, I might be able to stock that onto a short socket"

2021 Mazda3 Brake Squealing
I'm completely car illiterate so please bear with me if this is a dumb question, but I've tried to look online and haven't been able to figure out specific nomenclature for a fix.

My husband has a 2021 Mazda3. The brakes have squealed since the winter of year one (we are the only owners of this vehicle, bought new). When checked, they continue to say nothing is wrong, but they squeal at every stop. So this past February (2024) we broke down and got a brake job even though it seemed way too early to get new brakes. The sound went away, and now is lovingly (sarcasm) back. Upon a recheck, brakes are still in great condition.

We live in NC and the climate has been extremely humid and wet, and the car stays outside (not in a garage that is). So there is a layer of brown (rust?) on the brake...rotor? Drum? Disc? I'm not sure what that is but I can see it through the rim and it comes off on my fingers when touched. I'm wondering if this is just enough build up to cause the brakes to squeal, and if so, is there a way I can clean this? I'm a windows-down almost all year kind of person, but the sound is so incredibly loud that I can't. I can take a photo if that would help.

Any help is greatly appreciated!"

Struggling to Diagnose
I am in desperate need of guidance!! I have a 2015 Nissan Juke SL AWD with just over 140k miles. For most of the time I've had the car it hasn't really needed much maintenance besides oil changes, tires, and brakes. When I bought the car it came with 6 free oil changes and regular maintenance for each of those, so I didn't do much of the work on the car when I first got it. Now that I have been doing the work on the car it seems that everything has been waiting to all fail simultaneously. Of course when I'm already in the midst of financial burden, because I can't really afford to pay for labor. I've been doing my best to do the repairs myself and with a little help from my brother. Neither of us are experts, but can usually handle repairs as long as we can diagnose the problem. That is where I've been struggling for the better part of a month now.

I know that some of the issues I'm having are related and some are not, but I am going to list all the things that I have done on the car in the past several weeks and the issues that I'm having in hopes that someone is about to play Gregory House MD car edition. Not sure if anyone will be able to figure it out without looking at the car, but I figured it couldn't hurt to try. Maybe someone out there will appreciate the challenge.

Repairs completed:  
-New Alternator & Belt  
-New Battery and Battery Terminals (Nissan Dealer installed these)  
-New Valve Cover Gasket  
-New Spark Plugs  
-New Mass Airflow Sensor  
-New Air Filter  
-Idle Relearn  
-New Rear Brake Pads ( Not likely connected)

At first the issue was that the engine was sputtering at idle and when my fiancé was driving it the engine stalled out completely at red lights twice in the same day. The first thing I did was get new spark plugs to replace the plugs, because I couldn't remember changing them. When I went to change those, I pulled out the ignition coil on the 2nd cylinder and it was dripping with oil. There was also a little bit on coil/plug in the 3rd cylinder. Replacing the spark plugs didn't solve the problem. It wasn't until after I replaced these that the check engine light came on and I started to get codes. I have an inexpensive OBDII reader, so I was able to read the codes and reset them to keep tabs on how often the computer was throwing codes. Here is when I first got a 'System Too Lean Bank 1' code.

Here is where my brother started to help and we did a bunch of research and decided that we needed to change the valve cover gasket. My plan was to drive the car to work (about 10 miles), then drive the car over to his place after work and do the repairs. I made it work with no problem, but then when I went out to the car to leave after work and the car wouldn't start. I have a portable jumper battery that I couldn't get to start the car. For some reason while I was trying to get the car jumped, the immobilizer triggered. Because the battery was dead, I couldn't reset the immobilizer and because the immobilizer was triggered I couldn't start the car to jump it. By the time we realized we needed another battery it everything was closed and also while trying to reset the immobilizer we repeatedly removed the battery terminal and the terminal bent and broke. So I chose to have the car towed to a dealership, with the expectations that they would do an inspection of the car and at least tell me what was wrong in addition to turning off the immobilizer. They told me the battery was dead and charged me $450 for a new battery and battery terminal, but DID NOT do an inspection on the car and refused to do anything more on the car unless I agreed to let them fix whatever they found. Sending it to them was a mistake, because I then had to have it towed again to my brothers, because the engine sounded terrible.

There, we replaced the valve cover gasket and put everything back together. In hindsight, I'm not really sure what made me think that was going to magically solve the misfiring issues. After we put everything back together and started everything up the engine was making a distinct grinding noise. We found at the grinding was coming from the alternator and the belt and realized that the alternator was seized. The one detail I will mention that I'm still slightly confused about is that the belt didn't have many cracks on the grooved side, but the backside of the belt was well worn. We checked the tensioner pulley and it spun freely so I didn't believe that to be the issue...now I'm not so sure we shouldn't have investigated more.  So we got a new belt and alternator and tore apart the wheel well and removed the front bumper to fix that. All of this happened on July 4th, just for reference on how long this has been going on. Once that repair was completed, the grinding went away and the engine sounded slightly better, but not completely. But the car was able to drive and it still hasn't completely stalled since. One other note that I can't tell if it's related or not, before I did all these repairs the passenger rear brake light was out. It was on my to do list of repairs, but it seemed to come second to engine repairs. After I did these repairs, all of the lights in that assembly stopped working and only my right turn blinker began blinking twice as fast. My friend told me that it was likely a bulb that needed to be replaced, but I know it was be a fuse or electrical ground issue that causes this to happen.

I had to drive it to and from work at that point. I work in Milwaukee near where the RNC took place, so during that time I was simply too busy to do anything on the car at all. However, it didn't give me some engine codes. At this time I was getting the same 'System Too Lean Bank 1' code and I started getting an 'Idle Air Control System RPM higher than Expected' code. Also, the air conditioner stopped blowing cold air and it still isn't working. I spoke with a friend of mine who is a car guy and he told me that before I try to replace the Idle Air Control Valve I should do an idle relearn and that would likely fix the issue. Before doing this the car had been idling between 1200 - 1600 RPM. After doing the idle relearn the engine didn't seem to be stuttering as often as before and it was idling just about 1000 RPM which seemed closer to the 600-800 RPM my research showed it should be idling at. After doing this, the 'Idle Air Control System RPM' code stopped, but I was still getting the 'System Too Lean' and I soon after I started getting a 'Random/Multiple Cylinder Misfire Detected' code.

At this point, I started to get a major grinding from the rear of the vehicle. Turned out to be brake pad that was down to the metal. I had already purchased pads to change them when we did the other repairs, but we simply ran out of time after having to replace the alternator. I doubt this is helpful, other than to illustrate that there is a lot or work that needed and still needs to be done on the vehicle.

The car continued to throw these same two codes for awhile, even after I would clear them, they would return pretty quickly. After doing some more digging over the next few days, I found multiple sources talking about a test for the mass airflow sensor. According to what I found, if the mass airflow sensor is functioning properly, if you pull the lead off the sensor while the car is running it should immediately shut the engine off. If you remove the lead and the car continues running then the sensor is bad. I did that test and when I disconnected the sensor the engine kept running as if I hadn't even taken it off. So I went and got a new mass airflow sensor. I installed that into the car and to be honest, it seemed to cause the car to stutter and misfire more than it had been before changing it. After changing the mass airflow sensor, the 'System too lean' code stopped, but it was immediately replaced by a 'Intake Air Temperature Sensor 1 Circuit Low'. Also, I took out the spark plugs and checked the gaps to make sure they were correct. This was the second time I had taken the ignition coils out since replacing the valve cover gasket. The first time I took them out everything was dry and when I took them out more recently there was oil on the coil and plug once again. That was Wednesday and since then I've continued to get the Random misfire code and that Intake Air Temperature codes regularly and also a couple days ago I got a 'ISO/SAE reserved' code. From my research, this code isn't going to tell me much by itself, but hopefully it can be useful information to someone who really knows engines.

At this point the car is driving, but the gas mileage has been severely hampered, whenever the car idles it seems like it is going to stall, but it seems to rally at the last second and keeps running. The acceleration isn't always continuous and you can feel a slight loss of power as the engine misfires. I think I've put about 400 miles on the car since the alternator repair. I really hope that continuing to drive it isn't causing more damage to the internals, but I absolutely need to have a vehicle so I haven't really had a choice. At this point, the only other thing I can think of to do is to try to replace the Idle Air Control Valve or the IAT sensor, but I can't help but feel like all I'm doing at this point is throwing money at the car hoping that I guess correctly and I really don't have the money to just keep buying parts hoping to find the right bad part.

If you have read this far, I appreciate you even taking the time to read this far. I really hope that someone out here that really knows engines and Nissans and can somehow sift through all this information to come up with some idea that can point me in the right direction that can help me find the proper diagnoses and fix this. If you can help me you will officially be my favorite person in the world. This is probably my final Hail Mary before I take the car to a shop and struggle to figure out how to pay for the repair as well as the other bills I have that I can't afford."

Kia Sportage: could ignition repair affect power window operation?
My 2017 Kia Sportage was hit by a Kia Boys theft attempt, in which they broke my right rear passenger window, climbed in the car, ripped open my steering column, and tore out my ignition cylinder. Typical Kia Boys method. (My car had the software update and would not start, so they left.)

The car has been repaired at a collision center. Everything seems to work normally, except for the driver's door power window controls for the passenger windows only. From my driver controls, I can lower the passenger windows, but most of the time, I can't raise them. (It's a little intermittent.) 

The power window switches on the passenger doors themselves work fine in both directions, and the windows go up and down normally when you use them. Because of this, my body shop doesn't think anything they did, or any damage from the thieves, is causing the problems on  my driver's controls. They think those switches -- the ones in the drivers' door -- need to be replaced and they want me to pay for it. 

Thing is, this problem did not exist before the theft attempt and repair. So I'm wondering if it's possible that damage to the ignition cylinder/wiring, or improper re-assembly of it, could cause the driver's door power window switches to malfunction in one direction (up not down -- and only for the passenger windows; they work fine on the driver's side windows.) Sounds far-fetched, but I know nothing about auto electrical systems, so wanted to ask. 

Thanks in advance for any help.

What would cause radiator & reservoir to be empty in a truck that hasn't ran in years and had no previous problems? And how to go about?
VEHICLE: 2008 Toyota Tundra TRD off road 5.7L V8 2WD
MILEAGE: around 176,000miles

Truck's starter went out about 2.5 years ago and has sat untouched (outside) waiting to be fixed (Which is NOW!).

Now that fixing it I found that the coolant reservoir is completely empty and from what looks like the radiator empty too (I'm not sure how to properly check & confirm but don't see anything inside it when take the radiotor's cap off.).
I'd check the coolant about a month before it broke down & it was fine, and I didn't have any issues with the truck before it broke down (Outside of it seeming like a delayed start, which now know was starter. Mechanic confirmed.).
So what do I need to do and how do I go about it all? 
Truck's starter hasn't been replaced yet so can't be started just now. But need to try to have everything done & ready so can start truck once starter is replaced as well need to know what else I may be looking at having to do & what will cost me if there is a problem before I invest too much time & money into the truck that I can't afford.

I'm told to just put water in both radiator & reservoir to see if leaks, but also that may have to run in order to show a leak. Which if the case, don't I need coolant in there before run it? But either way, what am I possibly looking at having to repair??? 

I'm a novice. I know some about cars but not a lot. However am very mechanically inclined & bright, and can usually fix anything with the help of the internet & YouTube lol. And due to finaces I am forced to fix myself and learn more about cars from this experience.

*edit: prior to the starter going out there was absolutely no signs of problems other than delayed start the last couple of months that figured was the starter going out which it did & was confirmed by mechanic. There was no smoke at all, no over heating, no smells of any kind, no fluid problems, no misfires, no signs of problems whatsoever and the engine ran fine. 
When starter went out oil needed changing amd light indicator just went off. oil looked fine when checked after starter went bad. And oil doesn't look like what told would if coolant was in it, however now after sitting for so long when wipe oil dipstick on a paper towel it looks brown/black and then the second wipe looks like brown green (will post pics of) but this didn't happen until after sitting for a long time.

""Alternator bracket"" for 2006 Dodge Caravan?
 Sorry if this is not the right place to post.

My car recently broke down and I took it somewhere to get fixed. The guy I took it to says the problem is the alternator bracket (in his words a part of the ""tiny cover,"" whatever that means, maybe I heard it wrong). The thing is, he has not been able to find a new one to replace it anywhere. I desperately need my car up and running soon so I need to find the part. Any help is much appreciated.

2014 Ford Focus Shaking Issue
I bought the 2014 Ford Focus several months ago around 100k miles. This is my first car and I'm not car savvy to understand what's going on with the car.

When I first got it, I just notice that the car shakes/shudders whenever I accelerate in a certain gear. It is sometimes accompanied by a sudden high rev with no acceleration. I looked it up in the internet and figured something to do with the transmission.

My dealer tried to change its fluid but no avail. I went to an official Ford mechanic and they told me I had to replace the clutch and several parts around it which cost more than half of what I paid for the car and it will not fall under the TCM warranty. So I asked my dealer to fix it (as it is still within the dealer's warranty) and so they did (however, I'm not sure what and how they do it though).

I thought all problem is solved, I notice the car is totally fine when I drive alone. But whenever I have some people in the car or I'm bringing something heavy, the car shudders again on a certain gear like before. Especially if the car is going uphill. There was one time the shake was so bad and max revved on a hill with cars behind me, I got so scared I thought my car broke down.

The weird part is, after I drop off the heavy load, the car still shakes throughout the day. But if I give the car some 'rest' like leaving it overnight or don't drive it several hours, it will go back to normal again until the next time I need to bring someone else with me.

What seems to be the issue here?"

Paid over $2k to get a/c fixed, pressure blows low. Help?
Year/make/model: 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis

Pre-work condition of A/C: The air was randomly changing from blowing out of the front vents to the floor vents, to the defrost vents. After some time of doing this, the compressor ended up seizing/burning up and smoke and burnt rubber smell was coming out. The a/c was unusable for about two months until I took it into my trusted mechanic.

Diagnosis: The compressor and condenser needed to be replaced. The system needed to be flushed. The switch/dial area responsible for changing where the a/c was coming out of needed to be replaced(they ordered an after market part for this).

Post-repair: The pressure of the a/c was very low. Like, it was a soft caress of my face, sometimes barely reaching my face. It SUCKED and it was a huge let down because before this all broke, the a/c was strong as hell and ice cold. I could blast it for 30 seconds and then already be cold. It was great. What I got back was cold but nothing like it should be, and the defrost wasn’t even able to work well because the pressure wasn’t very strong. It would defrost in bands rather than the whole windshield.

After I got home from picking up the car, I had to call back and explain the issue. They understood and said I could drop the car back off and any work would be under the warrantee of the parts and labor just done. They hold my car for 8 days, telling me that the mechanic has to start from square 1 again because sometimes the compressor comes with oil filled too high, so he had to drain and refill it to improve performance. I also requested that a used switch head(can’t remember the name) that controlled the dials of the a/c be used instead of the after market part because the dial that increased and decreased the air flow was not working right. After the 8 days, they gave me back $146 dollars which I guess was the difference for the used part being swapped. Mind you, I paid $2300 for all this to be fixed initially.

I ask my mechanic liaison if the pressure is stronger. I don’t get a straight “yes”, I get a bunch of talk about how the temp goes down to the 40’s. My wife picks up the car and won’t tell me how she feels about it. The shit is the SAME PRESSURE. Just better dial control and maybe slightly colder. 

If they replaced almost every component related to the A/C, what in the hell could be preventing the air from blowing as strong as it used to? I know the mechanic is short staffed. But I was out of a car for a collective 14 days or so, and I feel like maybe the guy working on it just doesn’t know what the issue is with the blower. Help?"

Mechanic has had car for about 3 months - just give him the car and walk away?
Here's an odd one (to me), tho some online searching has revealed it  isn't unheard of. Like to know what other redditors think. 

Loooong story as short as I can make it:

1. My old car broke down several months ago (2006 Hyundai Sonata, lots of miles). Just stopped on a country road.
2. I'm not a car guy. No idea what the problem could be. Towed to my small town mechanic (he is basically a one man operation)
3. He spent a few days testing it, determined the timing chain needed replacement. Said it would be $1500. I couldn't replace the car for that of course, and don't want to get a different car at this time. I told him ok.
4. A few days later he calls, said that didn't fix it, but the timing chain was stretcher and needed replacement. without going into detail, I tend to believe him on this one. Said he would keep diagnosing.
5. That was several months ago. I have heard sporadically from him since. No progress on a fix. Basically he doesn't have a clue.

The guy clearly doesn't know the problem and doesn't have urgency to fix it. This has gotten beyond ridiculous. What I'm considering is just walking in with the title, tell him the car is his, and leaving.  Sure I told him to go ahead with the timing chain fix, but that was a couple months ago, didn't fix the problem, and he hasn't made any further progress on figuring it out. I checked KBB, and even with it not running and AC not working it has some value. Maybe then he would suddenly figure out what the issue was and could fix it for  himself. 

Thoughts from the community on that approach? I suppose if he threw a fit I could  offer him $500 (maybe a bit more) and still give  it to him.

I've been driving a loaner from my dad that I can hang onto for as long as needed.

thanks for your perspective."

Tailpipe cutters... am I using this thing wrong or is it just garbage?
Hey everyone,   


I recently borrowed [this tailpipe cutter](https://www.oreillyauto.com/detail/c/evertough/tools---equipment/rental-tools/exhaust-rental-tools/250754330d1f/rental-tools-evertough-3-4-to-3-1-4-inch-tailpipe-cutter/ren1/67070) from O'reilly in an attempt to fix my wife's leaking exhaust on my own. everything I'd read online suggested that this would be the best tool for this job due to being able to cut through the exhaust cleanly and without much hassle. 

&#x200B;

The box and brand name suggested that this tool was probably not of the highest quality (just reminded me a lot more of harbor freight-level tools than something from a known brand) .   


Got the chain wrapped around my exhaust, clamped down and began to rotate it.  It seemed to be going alright until suddenly multiple links of the chain fell off the tool and the whole thing kind of just fell apart on me.   


The root cause seemed to be a bit of a combination of there not being much width on the pins which hold the chain together to keep the individual links  from sliding off the pins (they're stamped in one spot which expands their diameter at that spot, but on some pins that stamping is VERY minimal)  , as well as all the holes in the links themselves actually stretching out a bit from my using the tool.  


A secondary issue was that after I reassembled the chain (and actually secured all the links back on by wrapping them in electrical tape which worked well enough for short spurts of use at least) I noticed that the cutting wheels themselves started actually chipping . 

So I guess what I'm wondering is;  Did I just squeeze way too hard on this thing? I don't feel like I was exerting an overly high amount of pressure on the handle and ultimately didn't even get through the pipe entirely.  If I were to purchase one (even Harbor Freight's version has better reviews and looks slightly higher quality) should I expect to run into the same issues here, or was this tool I borrowed just REALLY poor quality?   


  
Now I have to go back to oreilly with a broke-ass tool and try to convince them that I didn't just beat on the thing and break it or something so that I can still have my money back for the rental... "

2018 Kia Soul - DIY Repair After Car Theft Attempt
Hey folks, somebody tried to steal my buddies Kia Soul. He got laid off and switched to liability only insurance (talk about timing), so it is DIY time. I have done a little bit of wrenching over the years but this is a new one on me. Knowing how these kind of projects go, hoping anyone can give me some advice on what my actual part list is gonna be so I can track down a guide online for disassembly/assembly, and any potential quirks I might run into for this one. I have had my fair share of rabbit hole jobs that start out as a long afternoon and turn into a multi-week nightmare.  
He says he can technically still start it but they broke off the windshield wiper lever so that is stuck on, and they broke off the switch for the steering wheel height adjustment so the steering wheel just swings around.

Any advice folks can give me will be hugely appreciated. Really hoping we can bang this out in a weekend and not have to go to a mechanic. Thanks so much in advance.

2006 Honda CR-V - Runs rough at idle and during driving
I've been having an issue with my CR-V that's been happening for some time, and my attempts at diagnosing and firing the parts cannon has been partially successful.

Mileage 277,000

Engine:  2.4L

AWD

Here's the recent history of my attempts to fix this:

\- 50,000 miles ago - I noticed the engine started running rougher at idle and during drive, it was slight but noticeable.  No codes given

\- 45,000 miles ago - Noticed oil in the air filter box, found that the PCV valve was stuck and the attached hose was collapse.  Replaced both, oil in intake stopped

\- 44,000 miles ago - Cleaned throttle body

\- 40,000 miles ago - Spark plugs were due to be changed, replaced with Denso 3377.  No change to the running condition

\- 35,000 miles ago - Ignition coil resistance measured lower than the expected range, replaced with Denso 6732301.  No effect, suspect I found bad data on the expected resistance

\- 20,000 miles ago - Started getting P0420 and another catalytic code that I forget.  Lack of time and money prevented me from working on this.  Occasionally received an intermittent misfire indication on cylinder 2

\- 5,000 miles ago - Replaced the catalytic converter with an aftermarket one, running condition improved but still rough.  Immediately got a P0135 Oxygen Sensor Bank 1 Sensor 1 Heater failed code.

Replaced the Oxygen Sensor with a Denso 234-9064 Air Fuel Ratio sensor.  Code went away, running condition improved some what, but still poor.  Immediately got P0136 and P0137 codes for the downstream oxygen sensor.  I suspect I broke both of them during removal when I did the catalytic converter.  Sensor replaced with a Denso 234-4352, codes gone.  

The running condition is definitely better, I no longer have any bogging down and no check engine lights, however the vibration at engine start/drive is still prevent as well as it being fairly loud.  

I checked the intake hose, no tears.

Spark plugs don't look terrible, no oil on the coils.  However there was a red deposit on spark plug #1:

Water pump broke off a piece - what next
Hey Guys,

My car, Audi TT 2008, started to leak coolant and it looked like it is coming from the are of the water pump.

I took it apart thinking I will need to replace the pump -> however,  the plastic part next to the seal of the water pump broke down instead.

I am planning to buy the new part, 2 questions:

1. Should I go for the metal casing? Is it worth it?
2. The broken piece most likely is somewhere, do I need to find it?

More details for 2:I have tried to clean out the 2 pipes going to radiator -> but no  luck. I believe the inlet where the piece broke is actually flowing  towards the engine, if that is the case, I am not sure what is the best  place to look.

Rebuilt transmission broke down two weeks later
Hello,
Recently had our transmission rebuilt on our van at a shop here in California with a 6 month/30K mile warranty. My son drove the van up to Oregon, to report to work as wildfire fighter. 16 days after it was rebuilt and replaced, my son notices the gears won’t shift and it’s leaking fluid. He had it towed to a local shop up there to diagnosis it and they say he needs a completely new transmission. The shop in California said they would honor the warranty but we would have to tow/ship it down to them. Rates right now to tow are roughly $1500 dollars to tow it (16 hour drive - 32 round trip)
Not a car person and my husband who passed away was always the one who would handle all auto matters…asked for warranty paperwork from the shop and they said they don’t have any fine print it’s just 6 month/30K miles, whichever first."

Possible Transmission Problems, 2016 Ford Focus
I'll start off by saying I know very little about cars, so please be thorough but nice with your answers 😄 Also, yes, I know my specific car is notorious for transmission issues. I have had absolutely zero issues with it up until now, so I'm wondering if my luck has run out. The car has high miles (160k) as it was used for traveling sales previously but has been well maintained. Only repairs it's ever had were a water pump and a coolant line that broke.

Yesterday I was driving on the freeway, about 75 mph with the cruise on when the car suddenly downshifted out of nowhere. I pressed the accelerator, and the RPMs started to go down rather than up, then when I let off the gas, it downshifted again. I repeated this a couple times until I was going about 30 mph and thoroughly confused. I pulled over and put the car in park. Hoping and praying my car was fine, I then put it in drive again and pulled off slowly. Everything was working just fine again, and I finished my trip with no issues. I've driven it again today with no issues as well. Is this a sign that something is going wrong or just a freak occurrence? Can anyone explain why it did that? Should I get it checked out by my mechanic?

TIA for any help"

Hoping you can help me
My 2010 Chevy traverse broke down. I took it to jiffy lube because they’ve done repairs in the past and I was happy with them. They said it was one of my fuel pumps. Apparently my car has 2 and one went 4 months ago. They fixed it. I picked it up. No problems. This time it was the other one. I got the estimate. $1100. I told them go ahead. A few days later they say they fixed it but it has to be synced at the dealership. They apologize that they didn’t know that at the beginning, that’s what the book said. So I had it towed to a GM dealership. ($100 for the tow, $100 for what the dealership was going to do)They said they calibrated it but it’s still not running. They’re looking into what is wrong. My question is do I have any recourse with Jiffy Lube. I’ll be the first to admit. I don’t know anything about car repair. And I hate to pull this card but I have been screwed before. I’m a woman. But my understanding is, these days they plug the computer in and it diagnoses the problem. No fuss no muss. Did I just pay for something that wasn’t necessary?"

Broke something at parking curb. Don't know what it is called and what to do about it. Please help!
Hey all,
Fairly new to cars, learning the terms and trying to keep up. 

Long story short, misjudged the height of parking curb, this got stuck, and broke. It feels like soft  plastic or rubber, and is bolted underneath the front panel. It broke in such a way that both left and right side were dangling down and touched the ground. 

(There were 4 screws attached with it, using plastic .. ""bolts?"" 3 of them came apart, and only one is holding it in place.)

I was 5 minutes away from home, so used my dental floss to tie it up temporarily to come back and assess what's going on, take photos etc. 

So here are my questions:

1. What on earth is this called? Bumper lip? Valance? Bumper guard? Engline splash guard? Or something else? Tried my best to figure it out by google snd found these terms.. but at this point I think someone needs to tell me what this is.

2. Based on the nature of material and dmg, I think it is replaceable but not repairable. If so, do I take it to auto repair shop? Would it be affordable (lets say.. more than $60 for replacement part + service cost) or costly (replacement part alone is>$300)? Please note that I am not asking for an estimate, rather about affordability. 

3. If it is a front bumper lip, should I just remove the broken one and use an universal lip from.. say Amazon?

Please help. 🙏 English is not my first language, and I don't know what many items are called in English, so please bear with me.

Thanks in advance!

Cat converter weld cracked
Hi all,

2018 Chevy Traverse

A year back, an exhaust bracket broke.  It ties these two pipes together.  At the time I didn't see the point in repairing it.  Mistake.  I think the extra movement caused a weld to crack.  I've since tied it together as below.  Hoping the pipe clamp and wire works.

https://preview.redd.it/ckz12hl41sla1.jpg?width=2268&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=3b60b51f889e447e705a50c65c6f051318099a09

The car developed an exhaust leak noticeable on startup, but after about 20 seconds it went away.

The crack is at a weld between the converter and manifold (outlined in red below).

https://preview.redd.it/1966w5o01sla1.jpg?width=4032&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=19ebea8acb694f433241a14a4870dd82f6dcb4bd

A few questions:

1. Is this something a welder could repair?  Any thoughts what that would cost?
2. Could this be brazed at home?
3. JB Weld has a product called ExhaustWeld.  Do products like that actually work?
4. Any idea why the exhaust leak sound is so apparent at start-up, but then settles down shortly thereafter?

Thanks all for your thoughts."

Regarding tire plugs and patches.
I wrote this as a reply to another thread.
I hope this helps even just one person slow down to think of the possible consequences.

If you're unsure why patching or plugging the sidewall or shoulder of a tire is a terrible idea, follow along. 
""Motor Vehicle Service Repair Act"".

Random scenario: You're a mechanic in an auto repair shop on the east coast. A customer comes in complaining of a flat tire. Based on some minor sidewall cracking you know they drove on it flat. You find a 3/8"" concrete expansion anchor in the shoulder of the tire. You do everything you can to sell the customer a new tire and they categorically refuse and JUST want their flat fixed. You begrudgingly agree and proceed by removing the concrete bolt, applying a plug to the shoulder of the tire, charge the customer $20 and say ""it ain't gonna hold, but here ya go!"" and send them on their way.
Two miles down the road & the tire experiences a rapid decrease in air pressure event (it explodes) while the customer was going 60 MPH. Their car flips over and kills the driver and all three passengers while also injuring two other individuals due to a subsequent collision. Crime scene investigators and police forensics services division the tire blew out because it wasn't road worthy. The shop is now getting sued for YOUR negligence- which may or may NOT be covered by the shops Garage Liability insurance policy. Because you failed to exercise a reasonable level of care for the customer, the shops insurance company will fight tooth and nail to prove that there was intentional misconduct, that you acted in wonton, or you were reckless with your repair. They'll be looking for any reason to deny coverage. If the shops insurance company isn't there to cover legal fees, the shop owner will most likely go broke either paying attorneys to fight the cases or by settling out of court. Either way it's a lose lose. 
In all probability, there will be a sympathy verdict in favor of the injured. Wrongful death attorneys are known for being extremely aggressive in the pursuit of justice (which gets them paid!) Any one of those attorneys will attempt to ""pierce the veil"" of the business and come after the owners personal assets to cover the millions in judgements.

In some states and cases it's likely you'd face your own criminal / civil lawsuits for willful negligence. 
....But at least you got your $20 

Again I hope this helps even one technician slow down & think twice. Beside the shops monetary incentive we also have a moral responsibility to protect the customer from themselves. In this situation the auto technician is the expert which is all the justification needed to err on the side of caution. 🙂
Be safe and have a GREAT day y'all!

05 Kia Optima electrical gremlins, blowing fuses and lights.
I had some gremlins pop up. First the brake portion of both my tail lights burned out simultaneously, bulb replacement fixed that. Then about a week later my dome light fuse broke, changing the fuse fixed that. And finally the one I can recreate. If I start my car with my headlights on my tail lights/dash lights fuse will blow.

My guess with the recent cold I have an old brittle wire somewhere being naughty, but I'm the last guy to ask about electrical issues.

What are some likely causes of these three things happening relatively close to each other and what are the best ways to track down the problem to fix them? Is there a magical change one thing fix I can try first before diving into wire looms?"

Is $700 a ridiculous price to replace an ignition lock cylinder
Someone tried to steal my car (2011 Honda Accord) and broke off something into my ignition lock/switch that prevents me from getting my key in it at all. I had it towed to a place (recommended by the tow truck man) and when we got there they told me it would take 24-48 hours for them to call me with an estimate.  This morning someone called and said it was looking like around $700+ which seems crazy high to me. When I told him that online estimates to replace the part were max $300, he said it was high because they couldn't get the key in it and then would have to rekey it? He said he would call me again later after he calls the Honda dealership about getting the part and another mechanic looks more closely at it. I looked it up and replacing the part without a key adds another \~hour of labor. I tried calling other shops, and one quoted me $500-700 and I'm still waiting for another to call me back. I even tried a locksmith but he said an auto shop or the dealer would have to deal with a replacement.  I'm in LA if that provides better context. I'm a woman that doesn't know much about cars. I really don't want to get ripped off or go too long without a car, but I also don't want to have to deal with having it towed to another place if $700 is a fair price or if I can say something to talk them down. Any help is appreciated!!"

2014 Kia Soul Heating Issues
So back on Labor Day as I was leaving the store, my water pump broke while I was driving down the road. I pulled over the side of the road and had it towed home. My neighbor, a former mechanic who is retired, helped me out and put a new pump on along with a new belt. After he repaired it, I noticed the next day the car was overheating when going to work, but it only happened when the car was moving around 40mph as he kept it in his driveway on for over an hour with no issues. I brought it home and he thought that the water pump wasn't on tight enough. However, one thing to note is that going UNDER 40mph, the heat goes down back to normal.

It still wasn't the case and it overheated again. This time the heater stopped working when it got to the normal range and started overheating again. He noticed that the heater stopped when the second fan activated, the temperature in the engine is fine.

He decided to do a test to make sure the head gasket wasn't blown, it was all negative with no issues he could find after doing that test with the liquid. Spark plugs were fine and no issue with the oil, he could not find any leaks with the coolant. Finally he suspected it might have to do with the thermostat when the water pump blew. He replaced it along with triple checking the water belt, still having overheating issues. He has given up unless he can get any other ideas that might cause it.

He has never heard of this issue as all of the fans work. The only thing he can imagine is there is air getting in but he has no clue where it is getting in if it is at all. We are at a loss to what to do next."

Ford Transit 2016 3 different Dealership cannot figure out the problem
When Accelerating the Van Engine Light flashes and it has a hard time speeding up or keeping speed. Even lightly on the pedal gasing it the engine light will come on. Dealership can't figure it out, One just toss me out saying all they can do is earse the Code. Forcing me to try to figure out this problem myself.

I bought a Thinkdiag 2 and scan the van and also did a data stream while driving it down the road.

Found out I don't know what the hell I am looking at still lol. I would pay for a service where someone can read the report and tell me what looks off but I cannot find any such services online.

What we tried:

We have tried replacing the Turbo, Spark Plugs. Wasn't my idea to replace the turbo, it was suggested by a repair shop after checking the coils. The same shop that suggested to replace the turbo for 4k broke a bolt and cause an exhuast leaked that crack the manifold. So that was fun.

Is it worth fixing at this point?
I have a 07 Toyota Yaris s and in the beginning of my issues my overheating sensor was on for maybe a day or two before I could buy coolant, then I broken down at a stop sign. I took it to auto zone they said I need a new battery so I took it to Walmart replace everything new battery and oil change. I thought I was home free. Nope on my way home I broke down again and when I finally got home my hose from the coolant to the engine busted. So I took it to pep boys they said it was the alternator. Paid 1000 to fix it nope still happening. Now I have people telling me it’s the water pump. Now here’s where it gets fucky idk why or how but for about a week my car was working properly no problems and not over heating but now it’s happening again and idk if it’s worth fixing at this point but if I don’t I won’t have a car and I’ll be moving into a new apartment on the 1st. Any help will be great thanks for taking the time to read. 

TLDR: 07 car keeps overheating and now is stalling on me. Replaced battery new oil and new alternator well over 1000 in repairs should I scrap it or try and fix it."

Help! plastic tool broke into timing cover area. 2015 Chrysler Town and Country 3.6L Pentastar motor.
2015 Chrysler Town and Country, Help! plastic tool broke into timing cover!

Help!

I was replacing the rocker arms on my 2015 Chrysler Town and Country 3.6L Pentastar motor due to a bad rocker arm.

As I was using a plastic tool to release the tension off the timing chain, my plastic tool broke and I believe fell down into the space. I can't see it. Motor is still in the car. I was about ready to start reassembling everything too. I was trying to do it all the right way without shortcuts.  The plastic is thin since there is a bolt cutout as it needs to pass over a 13mm bolt before hitting the chain guide to release tension. 

I don't know how to get out of this mess, I seriously didn't count on this going so badly.  The piece is maybe 2.5"" long in the timing cover area. 

It was one of these tools.

Then i put it all the way down and it stuck there forever now when i click it to go up i hear something trying to kick in but the window doesnt go up. we thought it was the motor at first but it was working fine going up and down until i put it all the way down. we even tried the pulling it up method. to help the motor but it was stuck on that halfway position. we thought it might be a regulator but dont really know any thoughts? 

for context, my serpentine belt broke not to long ago then found out my battery was dead after i let my car sit for the summer and now that i am going back to school and im back home i need the car for the uni but found it i need a new battery replced the serpentine belt and nnow my window is stuck on. inside my door lol.

Getting ripped off
My wife's 2011 Honda CRV broke down the other day and she had the car towed to a Honda dealership.  (Going to the dealership was obviously a mistake)  The Dealership says the AC compressor seized and also broke the power steering belt.  They quoted us $2000 to replace the compressor and belt and flush the system.  This same dealership replaced this AC compressor 2 years ago because it had seized and burned the belt off as well.  Sounds to me they never flushed the system when they changed the AC compressor 2 years ago.  Any thoughts?  I understand labor costs and parts are at a premium right now but $2000 seems like a lot considering this EXACT same scenario happened 2 years ago and was worked on by them.    The parts for everything including flushing the system are under $400.  There is no way there is $1600 in labor when they pay their Mechanics $20 an hour or less.  Anyone else think they are ripping us off?"

Broken down car, need some help diagnosing
Hello everyone,

Like the title says, my 2012 ford focus broke down and would love any help in figuring out what is going on. I was driving on the highway at about 70 and the car began to overheat out of nowhere. I stopped for a bit and what I now know is coolant was dripping out of the car (the cover on the bottom of the car was soaked.) I went back home but didn't make it before my car shut off. Got it towed back to my house. It will no longer turn on and when I looked the coolant reservoir was completely empty. and the engine still cranks but won't turn on. I filled up the coolant reservoir but still didn't turn on. I tried to jump but the car still wouldn't turn on.

Do y'all have any guesses on what might be wrong? The car had 170,0000 miles on it.

Thank you in advance"

2010 Malibu Instrument Cluster
Hi guys, my 2010 Malibu broke down last week. It was taken to a AAA, and they ran a diagnostics. Got a couple codes back, (p0014, c0561 u2116 returned. Dtc U2116 refers to the instrument cluster). The main issue was p0014, the car would start with the camshaft sensor unplugged, so that’s what was recommended. Bought a camshaft sensor and changed it, car starts fine, however the instrument cluster is still blank. Tried unhooking the battery and restarting the car a few times, checked the fuse, not sure now. Probably gonna take it to scan for any new codes or whatever, don’t wanna pay another diagnostic if I don’t have to. 

TLDR: changed the camshaft sensor in 2010 Malibu, instrument cluster not working. 

(I can send the full diagnostic to someone if it helps)"

Damage Caused by Jacking Accord
I was helping my Brother in Law swap tires on his 2017 Accord Hybrid.  Maybe I should not have offered because an attempted good deed left my stressed out.

I did a quick look and it appeared there were safe jack points right behind the front wheels, and right before the back wheels - similar to how I've always jacked my Elantra and Mazda3. On the driver side, no issues, swapped both tires and got it back down. On the passenger side, I was lifting the front wheel and heard a pop, so immediately dropped it back down. We could see the running board (?) pop out from pressure at one spot and we could not push it back in. Seems like one of the retaining clips inside the trim broke. :(  Would this be a matter of pulling the whole moulding off, replacing the clip(s) and popping it back on?

[Area affected](https://preview.redd.it/v1utycps9c281.png?width=1334&format=png&auto=webp&s=7bfb608d9a920b8fe0021ba483b785e2f5a74eff)

I did notice the undercarriage had this undercoating applied (dark hard ""goop"", probably a spray) which I assume is there to help with rust-proofing. Some of this flaked/cracked off on my jack points. I'm worried about this causing a rust situation there. Is this a normal thing or did I fuck up? Is there a spray you would use to reapply a coating here?

Thank you :("

Hey all! Car repair is one of my hobbies and I rarely will pass up the opportunity to stop and help someone broke down on the side of the road.

If you were building the ultimate road side patch and repair kit, what items would you add? More often than not I'm finding myself wishing I just had that ""one thing"" I didn't think to keep on hand.

Kit so far: Water/coolant, 5w30 oil, Jumper cables, Zip ties, Epoxy putty, Fuses, Small tool kit, Tow strap, Cheap OBD2 reader, Small gas can, Small air compressor, Gloves, Shop towels

Help me become the ultimate good Samaritan! Would be handy for myself to keep on hand too I'm sure.

Looking for advise on headliner repair.
Not sure if this fits this fits this forum but can't find anything else on point.  Was looking for Custom Car Interior type threads but turned up zilch.  If anyone knows a better forum let me know.

I am about to redo the failing headliner in a Jaguar.  After years in a hot and humid climate the thing just gave way as the foam backing broke down and the humid, moist air created weight on the material I suppose.  I was looking at different materials and Suede (or rather synthetic microfiber suede) is popular for custom redos these days.  I didn't like it at first but It grew on me and I was thinking of using it on the job.  My concern is how it holds up compared to more tradition materials.  Anyone have experience with the ""Faux Suede"" headliner material?  At first I was most concerned about the weight having had experience living in humid climate where the weight on the moisture in the air has a tendency to pull the material over time, especially as it ages.  I have no where to really feel and look at the suede material other than after having ordered it.  But I did learn that this fake suede is foam packed like regular headliner material and is supposed to be lighter than suede, which was my biggest concern that the stuff would fall much earlier as time goes by, but if the weight is the same as traditional materials I'm assuming there is little or no difference.  Well I guess I've said enough about where I'm trying to go with all this.  Anyone have any past experience with the material and any comments or suggestions.

Thanks in advance,

2010 LT Power Steering Wont Work
2010 Chevy Impala LT. So I was driving a BMW before I owned this car and bought this one with the insurance money. I've pretty much done most of the repairs on every car I owned and after being sick of the insanely lengthy processes for everything on luxury German cars I decided to buy this to go back to nice simple American cars. Well the parts are easier to get through but this problem is a nightmare. This is the first time I've had a power steering problem on any vehicle I've owned and it's the biggest headache.

So about two weeks after I bought the car (I've had it since October of last year) I noticed the annoying winding sound but the steering continued to work. It would be foamed up implying air everytime I checked it when the steering went bad. Periodically it would start to have stiff steering and it'd lose fluid so I put it off by topping it off because it was cold out in the winter and didnt have a garage to work in. So then in February the pump just stopped working and topping it off wouldnt work anymore so I had to put it off until it got warmer. So basically it sat there without the pump until a couple days ago when I removed the old pump.

So after removing the pump I put a towel between the alternator and the pressure lines and did the turning the wheels back and forth crap and then came the struggle for the pulley. So the new pump dont come with pulleys so I had to go to AutoZone and get the removal and installer tool from them. Removed the pulley perfectly fine, then when its time to put it on, they didnt have the installer. GREAT. So then I went hunting around town and of course every single one had the installer missing or a stripped bolt on the installer. So finally I found a general GM one at Advanced Auto and AGAIN it was another problem didnt go down far enough for the pulley to be flush, so I had to go find some washers and the little """"S"" that goes on metal chains to rig the installer to actually get the pulley flush. Finally.

Put the new pump on the car, filled it up, turned the wheel back and fourth about 20 times to bleed it, left it sitting there for 20 minutes, turned the steering wheel back and fourth some more for good measure. Took it off the jacks, started the car and everything seems fine. No winding noises or any of that when I go listen to the engine. Great, sounds like everythings working. Then I start trying to drive and of course the steering is still super stiff. OF COURSE. So I go watch multiple videos on bleeding it and again it sounds right except one guy said to do it with the car running. Ok, so I go back out there, bleed it some more without the car running (video shown below). I could hear a draining sound but really couldnt see visible bubbles. So then I start the car still jacked in the air this time and start turning in back and forth and theres the winding sound again especially with the steering wheel all the way on each extreme (another video below). Then when I remove the cap super foamy just like with the previous pump. GREAT. This went away pretty quick with vehicle off and turning the wheel back and forth with the cap off again.

Then I look under the car and see a MASSIVE puddle under the passenger side. In the first picture from the front of the car I noticed that small puddle closer to the front when I first parked the car and noticed that every time I parked it so I think its something different or maybe a different line is leaking? Anyway after running the pump that massive puddle appeared and I have pictures on the link of the drops actively falling that were the exact color of the fluid I was putting into the pump.

So at this point I can only assume the pump is not the issue and that air keeps getting right back into the system when I run the car and theres a massive leak that pressure of the running car forces out faster. So here I'm guessing its one of the lines (not where the pumps at because I dont see any fluid when I put a rag under where it connects to the pump) or the rack and pinion system at this point. If it is the rack and pinion wouldnt it make it hard to turn or not turn at all even with the car jacked up? My understanding is that the rack and pinion actually turns the wheel back and fourth so if that was broke I shouldnt be able to turn the wheel so easily even when jacked up correct? I have a couple pictures of the closest I could get my phone to the tie rod with my phone and you can see bunch of fluid on the side but I cant tell where its coming from. Really any help here would be great because I really need my car I've gone too long getting rides from people.

Inexperienced in car repairs but willing to learn. Worth it to try replacing door lock actuator on Hyundai Elantra or should I pay the dealer to fix?
I bought a 2017 Hyundai Elantra Limitied from a Toyota dealership last June. In the last 2-3 months my front drivers door stopped working and the drivers sun visor broke. The sun visor is an easy fix although the reason it broke surprised me (cheap plastic hinge on the inside that allows the visor to rotate up and down snapped out of place and broke. Only thing holding them in place is another plastic piece and glue). But that’s easy enough to fix with a screwdriver and new visor. 

After having my car detailed 2-3 months ago I started having issues with the driver side door lock. If I unlocked the car I would see the door lock actually disengage. However, the door wouldn’t open if I tried the outside handle. I have to go across the passenger seat and use the indoor handle to open it, then walk back around to get in. If I then get out and close the door I can open it with the handle no problem. It’s only AFTER I lock it again and try to unlock it that it again won’t open from the outside. 

Anyway I couldn’t get the car into Hyundai due to being booked through August so I took it back to the Toyota dealership where I bought it and let them do a multipoint inspection and door diagnostic. They had the toughest time figuring out how to get the door off. They kept telling me there was a delay because Hyundai had some “proprietary door panel within a door panel” until I finally asked, “Is it taking so long because they’re looking for a service manual?” After that they seemed to figure out how to get the door panel off and told me they found out it was the door lock actuator. 

They quoted me just over $500 for parts and labor to fix it, so I called Hyundai to see what they would quote. They quoted me $275 ($110 for part and $165 for labor). That was understandable since they know how to quickly take their cars apart and repair them so I called Toyota and asked them to put it back together because I would get it fixed somewhere else. 

When I picked it up yesterday I started wondering if I shouldn’t try to fix it myself. I can find the service manual online and maybe follow some YouTube videos. It’s just that I have no idea what I’m doing since I have no real personal  experience in doing my own repairs. My dad had some experience and used to help out with brakes, rotors, and stuff like that but he wouldn’t touch anything that required messing with the engine, transmission, and it always took longer because he didn’t have a shop with a lift and wasn’t a full time trained mechanic. We live on opposite ends of the country now and I also don’t currently own any repair tools. I’m sure long term if I start doing more repairs it’s a worthy investment to get the tools but I’m wondering if it’s smart to tackle this to start saving money or just save my time and frustration and pay to have the mechanics fix it. 

I had an issue with an old Ford Explorer where the window wouldn’t roll down and it turned out being the window motor regulator and actuator I think? Anyway that job required a rivet gun and was going to be a pain for someone inexperienced on top of the time it would take me not having the experience or proper tools. Friends with experience recommended against doing that one myself So I just had it repaired. I love tinkering and learning so the only thing holding me back now is the lack of tools and lack of knowledge while also not having a garage. I have to park in a parking lot or on street and I’m worried I would take the door apart and then either not get it off or back together and not be able to just leave it and come back to it. It’s something I’d literally have to do in one sitting. On the other hand I’m getting tired of climbing across my passenger seat to open my door and could probably fix it myself without having to wait until September for them to fix it. 

Is this a doable first repair job for a complete newbie or something I should leave to the mechanics?"

Can an auto repai shop charge you for installing used parts that don't work?
My boyfriend has a 2003 Mitsubishi Outlander with 200,000 miles on it. The truck broke down and was towed to a transmission shop for repairs the middle of October 2020. At first the shop owner told him that his transmission was too shot to rebuild so they were going to have buy a used rebuilt one. Whenever we called about it he would say he was waiting on a part, but everytime it came in was broken, three times. He ended up telling us that the used transmission he put in didn't work and that he could rebuild his after all after telling us that it couldn't be rebuild. But he charged us for the broken used transmission and labor. It wasn't our fault he got old non-working parts. He also said that while test driving it he ran over something in the road and caused a leak that he had to fix. After about six weeks they said it was ready. We picked it up and drove it home on a Friday but it still wasn't running properly so we didn't drive it all weekend and drove it back on Monday. The man said he'd fix it.  Whenever we called about it the owner would keep coming up with more excuses. Again he ran over something during a test drive causing a second leak that he had to fix. He also said he had to replace an axle, why I don't know but we didn't authorize it so he better not charge us.  It came to $2,200 just to pay for the used transmission that didn't work and the labor. To rebuild his it cost us another $1,500. We've already paid him in cash, but we don't feel as if we should have paid for the transmission that didn't work. He said he'd call when they were finished with it but we haven't heard anything back. It's now the end of May and we still haven't gotten it back after 7 1/2 months. Shouldn't it be done by now? Are we obligated to pay for that transmission that didn't work? We've already paid cash in full (unless he charges us for the leaks and axel etc.) So how could we get the $2,200 back?"

Truck lost power steering on the way home today
Thanks for your answers.

Update - I wiped everything down in the area and drove it into the garage. The leak looked to be coming from a cooler hose at the top of the steering box. I decided to try and tighten the clamp and it felt kinda loose. I tried the other clamps and they felt loose as well. Probably cheap hoses that came with the cooler that was replaced a couple years ago.

Went to the auto parts store and picked up some replacement hose and fluid. Went to a hardware store and picked up some quality clamps for the hoses. Got the new hose installed, bled the power steering and seems to be working fine now with no leaks. About $35 for everything to fix it. Glad I didn't take it to a repair shop.


Original Post - On my way home from work I start hearing the power steering whine noise and it got tough to steer quickly (luckily I was almost home). Park it in the driveway, pop my hood and notice fluid all over the steering box area with a puddle of fluid underneath the truck. 

It's a 2003 Silverado 1500 and I guess I'm wondering what exactly broke. Did the steering box break a seal? Did a cooler line break? Could it the pump? I replaced the power steering cooler and lines a couple years ago but nothing else dealing with the power steering. 

I haven't dug into it any further yet because it started raining when I got home. Kinda thinking I might just take it to a shop to get it fixed unless it could be a fairly easy fix but that's what I need help with from this community."

[Cosmetic/Body Damage] How hard would it be to replace a bumper on a 2015 Nissan Rogue by myself?
2015 Nissan Rogue

Got into a minor fender bender on Friday and will need front end repairs. Just got it quoted, mechanic said $2,100CAD for new front bumper, grill, and labor. Due to covid-19 I am strained financially and looking to save costs. Bumper doesn't appear to be damaged enough to warrant a replacement part (unless a bend/move won't allow for a re-mount of the bumper). I found the part here for ~$500 including tax and shipping.

My question is; how difficult would a bumper replacement be to do at home? I have basic hand and power tools but nothing fancy. My deductible is $1500 so worst case paying an extra $600 out of pocket for the body shop to fix it would be a better option.

Note: Fortunately there is no mechanical damage to the radiator or quarter panels, etc.

Edit 1: Yes I have to fix it. It isn't my vehicle, I was borrowing it to get to work as mine broke down 🙃."

Can I hold a autoshop accountable for leaving my radiator cap off and destroying my engine?
A local shop (very professional and reputable shop) I went to gave me an oil change a few weeks ago. A few days ago I was on a road trip with my girlfriend and my car slowed down into a stop. I opened the hood to see the radiator coolant cap was completely off and there was coolant all over the engine. 

A new shop just told me it would cost $1,500 to repair because my engine overheated, my timing chain broke, and the compression on 3 of my cylinders are messed up.

**Edit: Thank you for all you guys’ help. I realize I can’t hold the shop responsible because this is totally my fault. I have to pay more attention to what’s going on in my car. Off to buy my new engine🤦🏽‍♂️**"

2003 Mazda Tribute - broke exhaust pipe - clamps?
Hi There - 

This is a 2003 Mazda Tribute, 4WD , V6

I have a broken exhaust pipe hanging down now. Not sure how it broke but - from the looks of it it has just rusted away over the years. The car runs pretty good and has never quit on me - I try to keep up with it okay. I don't have that much money and need to get this fixed - but I want to do only what's necessary for it to be safe and operational and nothing more. 

I saw some videos of people using adapters and exhaust pipe clamps to fix these kinds of things. I'm no mechanic - but I'm handy and have half a brain at least. 

Is there any world where I could fix this myself - and how would you recommend? Or is this too insane and I should take it in - if so how much do you think the fix should cost? 

Pictures attached! 

Thanks

2010 Hyundai Sonata engine mount issue
TLDR: the engine is hanging on passenger side, mount bolts are in various states of broken. Am I on the right track, and how hosed am I if I pay a real mechanic?

Relative car noob here. I've had some rough driving over bumps, dips, etc. even just rough road my car sounded SO clunky. I thought it was something with suspension, checked a few things (no leaks or cracks), nothing obvious there. It would idle rough in park, but neutral is easier. so maybe it was the transmission. but it shifts fine.

Then I was doing some reading and realized it could be engine and transmission mounts. from videos and the Haynes book it looks simple to replace. but nothing is simple in my life it seems.

so just HOW screwed am I? IE if I pay to have this fixed, how much to replace?

for DIY. I was thinking. for

\#1 I can remove/replace the mount, remove the top of the bolt and put a new one in. the hole on the engine block goes all the way through. easy.

\#2 I have no clue how to extract it out of the engine part other than drilling it out and trying to re thread it. I may be able to do an upside-down #3 and save the trouble.

\#3 the bolt should come completely off when I remove the mount (worst case I Dremel it off). there's some recess where it broke off inside the thread. So douse it with penetrating oil, and try and screw it out of the hole with a same diameter bolt.

worst case I would have 2 supporting bolts. which is better than none. the car has 140k miles on it, and otherwise runs fine. i just want to keep it around another 40k if possible so i have time to save for a newer car. I generally run my cars into the ground until it becomes cheaper to replace the car than fix something.

Edit: the side mount bracket is 218153K060. but what are the bolts? pictures in the diagram show smaller than what's on the car."

Is it safe to drive worn pads short term?
Hey, I've got some pads that are pretty worn down (to nothing) on a town and country.  The pads are under warranty because I had them replaced this last spring but the rotors are gone and weren't replaced with the pads.  I'm a little broke and will have the funds to get new rotors on Friday and I'm wondering if it's safe to drive until then?  Obviously I'll have a grinding sound and it's not good for the rotors but since I'm replacing them anyways I don't think it should matter but I wanted a second opinion since I'm not really a car guy.  Thanks!

&#x200B;

Also, I'm doing this myself this time, if you know any youtube videos for my style of rotors that would be awesome, I've found a few for my year of town and country but they seem to have a slightly different style than mine is.  Not sure why that is.

2007 Saab 9-3 Aero - engine swap
So my 07 Aero (170k mi) had been having an injector circuit open/misfire issue for a few weeks that two different shops were having trouble diagnosing. Eventually found out part of the injector broke off in the engine which is causing my misfire even after replacement. Mechanic he could tear down the front of the engine (15 hrs labor) but might end up finding more issues than a direct engine swap would cost in the long run. 

Mechanic quoted me at $3700 (parts and labor) for a refurb engine (45k less miles, ~ 120k) along with swapping out the water pump and timing chains while the engine is out of the car. 

Do you think this is worth it in a 12 year old car that is in great condition other than needing new front struts and rear pads and rotors? Or should I just cut my losses? 

I love this car to death, so I don’t want to give up on her but I’m torn."

Auto repair question: Should I take car out of repair shop?
Four days ago (Saturday at 3am), my 2013 Honda Accord (with 60K miles)  broke down while I was on my way home. I called AAA, who towed it to a nearby ""AAA-authorized repair shop"". The Yelp reviews for this repair shop are good, so I decided to leave my car there, figuring that I could get a diagnosis of the problem and possible repair on the same day.

&#x200B;

**It's now Wednesday morning, and I still don't have my car, as the repair shop has been holding onto it this entire time. I don't know if I should take my car out of this repair shop or leave it there - background details below.**

&#x200B;

On Saturday morning at 8am (several hours after my car broke down), I called the repair shop, but they said they wouldn't be able to diagnose my car until Monday morning. Fine.

&#x200B;

On Monday morning, they told me that the car's tensioner was damaged due to wear-and-tear. This in turn caused the timing belt to fall off and the drive belt to become shredded. They quoted me a price of $1,000 for these repairs, which I approved. They said they would complete the repairs the following day (Tuesday), but would still need to check if there is any engine damage.

&#x200B;

On Tuesday (yesterday), they told me that they had completed the belt repairs, but found that the engine is damaged. At least 1 (if not both) heads are damaged, and **the repair will cost $2,200-$2,500 on top of the $1,000 for the belt repair. They're also saying that the repair will take 1 week to complete** \- keep in mind that I haven't had my car for over 4 days now.

&#x200B;

**What should I do?**

I am seriously considering taking my car out of the repair shop, as I am worried that they will keep ""finding"" new things that are wrong with my  car and jack up my charges even more. If I choose this option, I would pay the $1,000 bill for the belt repairs, then take my car to another auto repair shop in the area for comparison's sake. I would ask  this second auto repair shop ""if they can check for any problems with  my car"" (without mentioning the supposed engine damage), and then see what they  tell me.

&#x200B;

**Does my plan make sense?**

**Or would it be better to just leave my car right where it is? For that matter, do the quoted prices ($1,000 for belt repair + $2,200-$2,500 for engine repair) and diagnoses make sense, or is the proposed engine repair unnecessary and/or too expensive?**

&#x200B;

Thanks so much for your advice."

500 to 3000 RPM Rapidly Fluctuating Idle
2003 Acura RSX Type-S 213K mi, Manual Transmission

The short of it: 

Idle works fine for a minute after vehicle is started, then fluctuates rapidly between 500 and 3000 rpm.


Long story:

Recently replaced a bunch of stuff, alternator, starter, all AC devices, coolant.  After I put it back together, car ran fine but then encountered idle problems, it would stall if RPMs dropped between shifting gears.  It also came down with transmission problems seemingly randomly after my repairs, but that's another story.  I wonder if I bumped something or unhooked something that could be causing both problems.


So far I have tried:

- Checking codes - No codes, no check engine light

- Reset ECU

- Cleaning throttle body and IACV 

- I tightened throttle cable so instead of stalling it now wildly fluctuates

- New knock sensor: While doing other work, I broke this off, so I bought a cheapie from rockauto.

- Clean IAT sensor


- Checking live stats

----- Calculated LOAD Value: 48.2%

----- Engine coolant Temp: 75 C (seems high considering car had only been on a couple minutes) (On 2nd test the next day, coolant temp was 32 after car was running 10 seconds only)

----- Short term fuel trim - bank 1: -1.6%

----- Long term fuel trim - bank 1: -9.4%

----- Intake Manifold Absolute Pressure: 47.0 kPa (I read here that this is normal for idle)

----- Engine RPM: 980/min (was in the middle of going between 500 and 3000)

----- Ignition timing advance for #1 Cylinder: 2.5 degrees

----- Intake air temp: 16 C

----- Absolute throttle position: 9.8%  (does this mean I tightened throttle too much?)

----- O2 Sensor Outlet Voltage (B1-S2): 0.660V

----- Short term fuel trim (b1-s2): -8.6%

----- Equivalence Ratio (B1-S1): 1.999

----- Oxygen Sensor Current (B1-S1): 15.88 mA


What I plan on doing:

- Replace spark plugs

- Replace air filter

- Replace MAP Sensor


Any ideas what's going on?  More things to check?"

2001 Honda Civic Timing Belt Broke. Junk The Car?
Last week I broke the timing belt at about 20 MPH.  I was originally unsure what happened until I had it inspected as the code the car threw was P1362: Crankshaft Position Sensor.  Once inspected my mechanic showed me the timing belt was completely broken and quoted me $1200 considering that I have most likely bent some valves.  Including all of the parts the timing belt job, machine shop inspection of valves, and sensor.

A coworker of mine seems to be sure that valves are not bent and the car can be repaired with a simple timing belt job and sensor replacement for ~$700, but I'm having a hard time believing no valves were bent and am weary of risking money on a repair that may not fix the issue in it's entirety.  

In addition to the mechanical issues related to the timing belt breaking, the car is also in desperate need of new struts.  I'm very worried about the repairs considering they are almost worth the same amount of the car and I'm boiling down to the following options and seeking advice and confirmation the quotes seem fair.

- Repair the vehicle(Belt,Sensor, Valves, Struts)
- Repair the vehicle(Belt, Sensor, Struts)
- Junk the vehicle
- List as a mechanic's special 

A 2001 Honda Civic in the Orlando area is valued at $1200-$2200 on KBB, posts on craigslist range from $1500-$2000.  Thoughts?

2011 Chevy Malibu Running Loud and RPMs up to 5k just to Get on the Highway.
I’m not great with cars, but I’m looking for some advice so please forgive my ignorance.

So my car broke down a few months ago. I believe it was something with the fuel injection system. I had it fixed, but I noticed the car seemed to be a bit louder on acceleration.  The shop said they couldn’t reproduce it. Even though it was subtle, it was consistent. 

Fast forward a month or so and the noise is much more obvious. The RPMs run high on acceleration and it seems to shift very late.

I assumed this was the transmission system so I did a little research and it seemed like low transmission fluid was a reasonable if not hopeful cause. My vehicle doesn’t come with a dipstick for the transmission so I attempted to open up the fill level plug but found its covered by plastic guard that was itself secured a by a few guards. So i took it into a shop to get the system flushed. They told me if there is a problem with the transmission then I shouldn’t bother because it will just make the problem worse.

So I took it too a transmission repair shop and they test drove it. They said the transmission sounded fine, but it did feel like it was losing power. They recommended I flush the oil and check the actuators to see if that was the problem, but I don’t want spend 130-150 bucks to find out that isn’t the problem.

I am able to keep the RPMs and the noise down if I use the optional manual transmission system and it seems to shift on cue when I tell it to.

Since visiting the transmission specialists and the guys who recommended I shouldn’t flush my transmission fluid 2 days ago, my gas mileage has been horrible. I’ve used about a quarter tank to go 25 miles. 

Additionally, there is a check engine light on that several mechanics have told me the code is something to do with the camshaft and that it isn’t the source of the problem.

Any thoughts on where to go from here? Are the actuators the most likely culprits? Any ideas of what questions I should be asking of my mechanic? Any help is greatly appreciated."

2010 Nissan Sentra Electrical/Battery/Starter Issues
Hoping that you fine folks might be able to help me figure out wtf is going on with my car!

Background:A couple of weeks ago, the battery on my 2010 Nissan Sentra died.  It was old, and I had definitely put off replacing it for a bit longer than I probably should have.  Picked up a new battery and went to replace it, but upon disconnecting, the positive cord terminal broke off.  As some of you may know, Nissan uses [this](https://www.1aauto.com/nissan-positive-battery-terminal-connector/i/nsbcb00001?f=936660&y=2010&utm_campaign=gb_csv_br&utm_content=BCB&gclid=EAIaIQobChMIx9WF_O333AIVSLjACh1VRAY1EAQYAyABEgI56fD_BwE) proprietary terminal.  Unfortunately, it was Sunday, and the dealerships were closed, so I had to jury-rig a standard marine terminal from Wal-Mart on there to get home and to work, until I could get to the dealership on Monday.  Everything worked fine, and I replaced the terminal with the Nissan part on my lunch break.  Again, everything worked fine for a coupe of days until the vehicle would not start again.

I popped the hood and found that I had not tightened the terminal fully, so I re-positioned it and tightened it back down.  The vehicle continued to work fine for another couple of days, until one afternoon it refused to start completely.  Seeing that the passive electronics (car alarm light and dome light were also not working, I pulled the battery and hooked it up to my charger, thinking I had perhaps left the light on overnight and drained the battery.  Upon connecting to the charger, the battery read 97%.  I topped it back off to 100%, just to be safe, and plugged it back in.  Still nothing.  

After being left overnight, the passive electronics came back on, but when I attempted to turn on the headlights, all I got was a rapid clicking noise with the dash lights flickering on-and-off.  When I attempt to start the vehicle, it displays similar behavior.  I attempted to jump start from my wife's Honda, but received the same results.  I have checked the fuses and wiring, but those all appear to be in good shape.  

Any suggestions?

2002 Dodge Neon, broke down and leaked coolant
I'm a delivery driver and on my way back from a delivery my engine sputtered out. I couldn't accelerate and I lost power steering. I was able to coast into a parking lot and park. Car refused to start after that. It would turn over but wouldn't start. After I got out of the car I saw that it was leaking green fluid behind the front passenger side wheel which I was told is antifreeze. Got the car towed to a mechanic but they don't open till tomorrow. Any idea what the repair for something like this would be? I'm worried that coolant started leaking on my way back and I overheated my engine, but it didn't sound siezed when I tried to start it since it turned over as normal.

2003 V6 Ford Escape Multiple Misfiring Cylinders
Ran into issues late last year (2017) where my Escape would repeatedly rev while I was accelerating or idling. It got to the point where it completely broke down and wouldn't start up again. I got a new fuel pump and filter at a shop near where it broke down, and it seemed to run fine again. 

After a few weeks, the engine started acting the same way again. I took it to my local, reputable shop for repairs, and they replaced 6 spark plugs and an ignition coil, and used fuel injector cleaner. They mentioned that the #4 cylinder had been misfiring. 

A few weeks of light driving later, and the issue began to persist again. I took it back to the shop, and they said I needed another new spark plugs and ignition coil because the #6 coil had been misfiring, too.

Over the past few weeks, after having driven it only every other week or so for a while, the issue is returning, badly. I needed to get my emissions test done, and I failed due to:

Engine Misfire Detected On Startup
Random/Multiple Cylinder Misfire Detected
Cylinder 1 Misfire Detected
Cylinder 2 Misfire Detected

At this point, I'm at a loss for what to do next. I've sunk over $1000 into repairs within the past half-year alone, and nobody can seem to fix it to the point where it isn't back in a shop within a few months.

If I could get any advice on what I could be dealing with here or how I could potentially approach this situation, I would really appreciate it."

94 Ford Explorer automatic transmission first gear not engaging
Specs - 4.0 V6 engine.  ~260,000 miles.  Original transmission.  4x4. Automatic.

Hi everyone,

Long story short, I can't get my car into first gear.  I noticed the issue about 15 minutes into a drive.  About 30 minutes into that drive, I was on the side of the road and had to tow to a shop.  They say I need a new transmission, but that would be the death of this car.  Here's what I experienced:

About 15 minutes into that drive, from a stop I would hit the gas.  The engine would rev, but the transmission engaging took a moment.  Seemed to grind a bit, but I don't fully remember.  I got a slight roll forward until it engaged.  Over the next 2-3 stops it got worse until it finally wouldn't go again.  

What I know: 

- It has transmission fluid (I just got it serviced) although the fluid smelled awful when I checked it.  Smelling like piss is the way I remember it.  As far as levels, it appeared overfilled but I wasn't on a level surface.  
- It will reverse and move backwards - no concerning connection issue.  It had no issues during that drive in higher gears - no slipping at all.
- About two weeks ago I had a fluid leak and it quit on me - it was an issue for all gears when the fluid ran too low.  I reloaded the fluid and got the leak fixed, it showed no signs of issues for 2-3 days (until the day of this event).

Recent shop history:
- Took it to a big transmission chain for the leaking issue, got a quote for a new transmission.  Hard pass.
- Took it to a local transmission shop for the leak.  They replaced the modulator and did a fluid service.  Told me the broken modulator caused the vacuum to suck fluid out the transmission and burn it on the engine.
- Two days later it broke down, I took it to 3rd shop.  They just called and said it needs a new transmission because they ""can't get it to move."" Not specifically a transmission shop.  Just what was available in that town.

End of facts - now my speculation.
- I'm suspect of the last shop due to that wording.  Sounds like they didn't get it in the garage at all.
- Since only first gear was an issue, I want to say the problem is there, not in the transmission itself.  I don't know enough about how it works, but I would guess I stripped something important and it was living on borrowed time.  No way the 2nd shop would have known.  It was fine for 2 days on 5-10 minute drives in town prior to the issue.  In my mind the transmission engaged 1st gear correctly, but that gear is now stripped.

I'm looking to see if it's worth towing elsewhere.  I'm not satisfied with the 3rd shop's answer and that is probably enough.  I hoping anyone could help with expectations.  I think I'll go back to the 2nd shop or maybe try to call them tomorrow for a phone consultation.  Any clues would be appreciated.  The car has a list of things to be done (tires, brakes, AC) so this is the big domino that will decide it's fate.

Thanks!  Been driving this car for 15 years.  I'd hate to see it go..."

Scion xa high rpms/sluggish ??.
I was driving to my house in the mountains(going up hill) and I was in fourth but it didn't feel responsive and I would push on the gas and the rpm would go really high but barely increase speed. so I tried the other gears which also felt similar, sluggish acceleration and high rpms. The last hill to my house is steep and it barley made it up in second at 4-5 thousand rpms. I stoped in neutral at my house and there was a really terrible burning almost plastic or something smell. I assumed from such high rpm. The neutral idle was 1.3 rpm which seems higher then normal. The next day drove it down the hill and felt a little more responsive but probably because I was going down hill. Any help is much appreciated I'm a student who prays my transmission isn't bad or something gotta get to class and I'm broke.

Fixing an unevenly torqued water pump.
I screwed up! Last night (LATE last night) I was replacing the water pump in my wife's 2003 Volvo XC/70. Torque specs say the water pump bolts should be tightened down to 15ft/lb (20nm). Halfway through torquing the bolts my go-to click torque wrench BROKE on me, so I grabbed a second older torque wrench that I had in the cabinet to finish them off.

This morning, I walked into my garage to start wrapping up the job, picked up the torque wrench, and realized that I'd somehow set it to 22ft/lb. A quick check of some of the bolt heads confirmed that about half are at 15ft/lb, and the other half are at 22.

I should mention that there's water pump gasket sealer on the gasket, and threadlocker on the bolts. All fully cured, at this point. 

So what's the best way to move forward?

-Back out all the bolts and retorque to 15 ft/lb?
-Torque the 15ft/lb bolts to 22 so they will be even?
-Leave it alone?
-Tear the whole thing apart, buy a new gasket, and start over again?

I'm really hoping it's not that last one..."

2000 Dodge Neon 2.0Ltr Automatic. Rotates but won't start.
The Story: Car broke down. Timing belt broke. Second time it happened to us in about 8 years.

So we get a new timing belt.  Got the valves checked and repaired, pistons A-okay. Cam is alil worn so we replace it and most of the rocker arms were replaced. Moved over the cam magnet from the old one to the new one. Replaced all the gaskets and seals. Set the timing TDC. Rotated several times to make sure it was set correctly.
Slapped it back together and ran it for about 10 minutes on low to no coolant (Rough Idle and a light knocking sound, it disappeared at a higher rpm). We noticed the radiator had a crack on the top with steam coming out. 
I tell my dad to kill the engine. (It was hot)
Afew days later we take out and install the new radiator. While taking out the radiator I accidently disconnected the pressurized AC condenser which let out a pretty loud pop and scarred the living crap out of me and my dogs.
I noticed while taking out the radiator that it had transmission fluid coming out from the bottom reservoirs. It got bled dry.

I installed the new radiator and figured there may be a way to fill that bottom reservoir on the radiator later.
I made sure the engine has all the coolant it needs before I try and run it this time. It ran for about 4-5 seconds and died.

I check the codes on the dash to try and trouble shoot the issue.
P1684 , P0743 , P1282 , P1495 , P1193

Doing online research I heard that if the transmission doesn’t have the fluid it needs it dies. Im pretty sure when we bleed out the transmission and added a dry reservoir to it triggered something in it to not start.
I also want to check the timing again. But I want to make sure it’s not the transmission 1st.

Please, I need help guys. I’m not a real mechanic but I can do afew things. I need advice and things to check or do.

My battery dash light is flashing intermittently, my good battery is dying, and I have a new alternator
Hi! I have a 07 Subaru Impreza 2.5i. On my way to my uncles house I broke an accessory belt that ran my alternator and power steering. My battery died so I borrowed one from him to get to an autopart store. I installed the new belt and drove home. Few days later battery died again. I removed it, charged it, and removed my alternator and had Autozone bench test both. My battery is fine, alternator toast. Bought a new one and installed it.   
  
Car ran fine other than the battery dash light would flicker on and off sometimes. I assumed this was because I tightened the negative terminal all the way and it was still loose enough that I could work it off with my hands. Two weeks after installing the alternator my battery dies again. I fully charge my battery and tighten a nail in with the terminal; now the terminal is in tight contact 90% around.   
  
I drive to a different Autozone, they test the battery and say its totally fine. Now the battery dash light is ""on"" about as much as it's off. It doesn't just light up, it flickers with different intensity with seemingly no pattern or relation to what the car is doing. It'll flicker rapidly between dim and medium, then between bright and really bright, drop down to dim, back to bright, then off for a few minutes.  
  
Why would my good battery still be dying with a new alternator and what's up with my battery dash light?"

Broke off oil pan mounting bolt while tightening...Am I screwed or REALLY screwed?
A little background, I've had an annoying oil leak on a 2000 Rav4 for a while now. The valve cover gasket was changed a few years ago as was the oil pump seal but there was still a leak behind the engine.  After some research, I was told that it could still be the valve cover and that on the Rav4's they have to be pretty tight so I tightened the spark plug tube bolts that hold it down last week and degreased the engine to check for new leaks.


This afternoon, after a week, I decided to take another look.  The valve cover area was still clean (behind also) so I crawled under the car and noticed new oil around the oil pan bolts, in particular, facing the rear of the engine. So I got my 10mm socket and turned the first bolt and it was actually pretty loose so I tightned it and it felt solid. I did this for the next 4 or 5 and no issues...they felt nice and tight once I was through. I noticed one of the bolts was actually a nut so I thought some idiot must have broken one off at some point and made it work.


Anyway, then I got greedy and checked the ones on the side and they seemed loose also but even with hardly any pressure, they kept turning as if it was stripped.  I left that one alone and went to the next one and it felt the same except it actually broke off as I was turning it!

So anyway...what are my options here? if a bolt is broken, can they drill in and remove it and retool it so it can accept a bolt?  Does one bolt matter that much?

My thoughts are that if the leak is about the same as it was or worse, I should really take it to a dealer but they want $440 for the gasket replacement and aren't sure they can deal with with the broken bolt. I could take it to a local mechanic near where I work, but it looks like this had gone through that route at some point and perhaps why the bolt broke off so easily with hardly any pressure.  

I guess there is a frozen hell's chance that the leak may have improved too due to my tightening of the other bolts in which case I'd leave it alone.  

Any suggestions? :) "

How long can you drive with diesel in a gas engine
I own a 2007 Ford E-350 van. I have been renting it out to friends and bands for road trips, to help pay for the cost of maintaining it.
I live in Vancouver BC and leant my van to a friend for a road trip. I don't imagine I gave it to her with more than a half tank of gas in it.
She made it a few hours of highway driving south before she started to have problems with the van. Then just outside Seattle it broke down.
At first the mechanic working on it thought that someone had overfilled the oil (he claimed it seemed to be 6 quarts overfull.) That seemed crazy to me as I couldn't imagine who would have overfilled it.
Then today he called me to tell me he'd found gallons and gallons of diesel in the tank, which would have caused the oil level to rise.
My friend claims that she did not put diesel in the tank. I'm not much of a car guy, but the consensus after a few google searches seems to be that you could not get very far putting diesel into a conventional gas vehicle. I can't imagine that I put diesel into my tank accidentally before lending it to her (and that it then drove fine on the highway for 3 hours before breaking down.) So I suspect she's lying.
It's looking to be a $1000 bill to fix the problem. What do you think?"

2004 Toyota Camry LE broke down this weekend, needs a new engine. could really use some advice.
Hi, everyone. I've had my Camry for a little over 2 years and had no trouble with it. This weekend I was out of town visiting some friends. I was driving my car down the interstate when the check engine light came on, the engine got louder, started rattling, and then started pouring steam. I pulled off the road and a highway service truck that stopped to help found that one of the hose clamps in my engine had popped off. He thought that was the only issue but then the engine wouldn't start at all afterward.

I got it towed to a mechanic (which has excellent reviews online, but I've never used them personally), and they just called me and told me that the engine is completely shot and it needs a new one. They quoted me $2200-2500 but will call tomorrow with a more accurate estimate.

Here are the questions that I have right now:

1) Does anyone have a guess as to what happened to my car? I asked the mechanic if he had an idea about the sequence of events, but all he said was that the hose clamp breaking probably helped the engine to break but that he didn't know much else because they hadn't gotten deep into the engine yet.

2) Does this seem like a reasonable identification of the issue? I feel like the cost is reasonable for the work to be done, but does it make sense that a hose clamp breaking could destroy the whole engine?

3) **This is the most important thing to me right now: is it worth it to replace it?** Ultimately, I'm willing to spend the money to get it repaired but only if this isn't going to set off a cascade of other huge expensive issues. Is it possible that I could replace the engine and then have minimal major problems for the next couple years? Or does this typically result in other major problems? I'm a graduate student so I really don't have the discretionary income to make a car payment right now but I could try to figure it out if it really wasn't worth it to replace the engine.

I'm really stressed out and frustrated because I bought my car because I'd always heard that Toyotas are ridiculously reliable. I've tried to stay so on top of maintenance with it--I've never been late for an oil change and I just replaced the struts, spark plugs, and got the transmission flushed at the recommendation of my usual mechanic. I really wanted this car to last me for a long time.

Any advice or help would be appreciated. Thank you.

Battery charging
I'm very new to this, forgive the basic question. I have a scooter, the voltage regulator (I think) broke which I found out when I had to kickstart it after the battery died. They fixed that in the shop. That means eventually it will fully recharge the battery, right? How much time of running would that take on that small battery? 

The problem is if the bike is left outside and cools down, sometimes the starter won't work, it spins for a bit then dies... But the kickstart always works on the first try.

I tried to check the battery with a charger, but I only found a 4A one for the car, and the battery says normal: 0.3AX5-10h, quick: 1.5AX1h. I connected it briefly just to check the charge, and it said 3/4 full. So I think the shop didn't charge it and it's been charging when running since... But then why does it have problem starting sometimes?"

2002 Honda Jazz - ""Random"" High Revs - Clutch Problem?
Hey all,

Our car has an issue where sometimes when changing from 1st to 2nd and once in 2nd, the car will rev high really easily when the accelerator is pressed past a short distance and the car will not have much power to it. Only going back to 1st will normal control begin, and even then going back in to 2nd 3rd the car will still rev high very easily.

This effect seems to just stop at some point.

Eventually we put it down to changing gears too fast from 1st to 2nd and using the accelerator too quickly while the clutch is still down. This usually only happens up hills as the clutch bite point is quite high.

Now I'm aware of this problem, I haven't done it since, so I think we know how it's caused, but the girlfriend has it happen every now and then.

What I don't understand is why this is happening. I figure something is broke or on its way out, and I assume it's some part of the clutch, but does anyone have an understanding of the problem and can explain it?

Sorry if my description is crap, but let me know and I'll expand where necessary.

2007 Dodge Caliber Headlight
My passenger side low beam head light does not turn on ever. Every other headlight turns on.. (Driver High and low beam, Passenger High beam)

Story Time!

Last summer I broke my passenger side headlight cover, but not the bulb. The headlights worked for about 3 months, and then the low beam eventually crapped out. Fast forward to a few months after the light stopped working, and I change the entire assembly. (Broke college kid, couldn't change it until I had a reason to. Finally got pulled over.) So I change the entire passenger side assembly. This includes cover, new connector, and new bulb. 

It should be noted, at this point I have discovered a broken bulb!

 So I plug that new assembly in, and lo and behold.. The low beam still does not work. Everyone told me.. ""Must be a bad bulb from the factory"" Nope, tried the driver's side bulb and nothing from the low beam. 

So, I'm wondering if anyone knows what could possibly be wrong, and if it's an easy fix.. I'm guessing there must be some water damage down one of the wires or something.. "

So I'm getting a new car today. My last one broke down because the timing belt broke and so it dented the valves. To repair it, it would cost around 1500 and I was having problems with it before with other things so I figured I'll just buy a new  used car. Getting an 01 Nissan Altima. Any tips for maintenance would be greatly appreciated. Besides the usual oil changes, what else can I do and how far apart?

1996 Buick Century driver's side power window issue
Maybe a good soul out there can help me out. All windows except driver's side function fully. 

This is the problem with the driver's side -- the window clip holding the rear part of window broke a few months ago. At about this time, I just got poor and could hardly afford gas. So, I just let it go, and just used the other windows and let this one kind of flop forward when I did forget that it wasn't working -- I would only be able to lower it or open it about two inches before it stopped and then only a half an hour to an hour later would I be able to lower or raise it just another two inches. 

In retrospect, I should probably have gotten the clip earlier, but I just didn't and let that window with the factory hole in it for the clip just flop around. But, from day one after the clip break, it did roll up and down those two inches. I went online and read in a few cases that when the new clip was installed and people pushed the window back into the frame and it ""clicked"" onto the track, that often the window just went back to normal.

Of course, today after I went to the shop and got the right clip, I put it on, pushed the window back and then the window worked even less than before. Now it is about 1/4 open and it only moves up or down about 1/8 inch, then gets stuck and won't move again for another hour.

It will not be assisted with holding the switch down and manually pushing the window up. But I do suspect that the motor must be okay, because it sounds good, albeit for just a second or two.

Is the fix possibly taking the switch apart and cleaning the connections? Or does this sound like a motor problem? Or a regulator problem? Or perhaps even a bad switch (well, part of one, just that driver's switch) that I should replace? That last one is the easiest fix as it requires no removal of the door panel. And I really want to avoid the mechanic if I can, because I just dropped a good bit of money to keep this puppy going and maybe squeeze out two more Arizona summers in it.

I maybe overexplained, but that is only because whenever I look on sites to match my mechanical issue, the complaint is almost always too vague.

Thanks ahead of time, feel free to ask me any questions if it will help.

Cheers to all and good health, happiness and peace."

Transmission fluid everywhere
While I was driving a 2002 Chevy suburban 1500 LT (slow speeds, under 20mph) there was a snap, so I tried backing up to pull to the side of the road but the transmission (auto) wouldn't shift to reverse, I shifted it to neutral and rolled it off the road. Further inspection showed that the lower transmission cooler line had come unattached from the radiator, sprayed transmission fluid everywhere in the engine bay, there were two generous puddles of fluid right when it snapped, and a small stream of it about 100yds down the road. Transmission fluid is red/brown with a mild burnt smell, the dipstick doesn't show any transmission fluid on it when checked. The pin holding the hose in the radiator connector was missing so I am thinking that broke and the pressure blew the hose away from the connector? Replace the connector? (Oreily's $6)  Tow it to a shop? Can I just add ATF, and it's fine? Does it need a flush? Filter changed? If so can I do it myself?. I'm somewhat new to auto repair but have done work, I've  done oil changes, shocks and struts, brakes, tie rod ends, control arms, and gutted/parted out another car."

Botched work by street mechanic, I hope to self repair. 2004 Honda Accord.
My car was backed into a few months back, no insurance information left, so I had a $500 insurance deductible, which I had not yet done. Today at a manual car wash, two guys approach me and offer to do the work for $200 (+some bumper repairs) I agree, they seem decent enough.

1 hour later

The main dent looks good. (Only good thing)
They couldn't get the quarter panel back on.
The window no longer goes up.
They broke the door lock (just the valve, not the lock mechanism)
The paint matching on the door and bumpers look not good.

I feel silly for trusting strangers who they themselves had a shit card. Live and learn I guess. Should have just done the $500 work.

I know I'll need to have paint work done, perhaps even some evening on the dent. I just had two questions:

1. How can I get the windows working.
The window goes down, not up. They mentioned fuses but I dont think he knew much.

2. They left some product (black gesso-ish) on the car saying to leave it on for 2 days and it will make everything flat and help match color. I am skeptical of this. Thoughts?

3. Color Matching: Anything I can do here? There's some white primer shining through and the gold they sprayed on is darker than the actual car."

2002 Toyota Tundra - Engine immediately stalls after starting; was stalling before in idle
Hope I've come to the right place and am following this subreddit's rules/etiquette as I've never posted here before. Sorry this turned out to be longer than I expected, and I surely am not auto-expert.

I have a 2002 Toyota Tundra, (V8 4.7L automatic) that's currently broken down in my driveway. A little background:

Shortly after x-mas someone broke into my truck by smashing the window to steal all my stuff, so that night after I filed the police report I drove it back home and parked it in my apt's covered parking spot, where it sat for a couple weeks during which I didn't drive it due to the cold weather. After those 2.5ish weeks I started it up and it kind of started up slow (which I thought was due to it sitting) but seemed fine. For the next couple weeks when I drove it I noticed that the engine block was shaking a lot when it was in idle, whether it be in park or drive. One day I started it up and it idled for a few seconds then stalled out. I successfully started it again and gave it a little extra gas and it stayed on the second time, but I noticed the check engine light came on.

At this point I popped the hood and checked the fluids, everything was fine except the radiator / coolant tank was bone dry. I left it at home and a week or two later finally got around to buying fluid for it, so I filled it up and started it and it seemed to be fine except the engine was still shaking a lot in idle. I suspected there was a leak in the radiator or one of the hoses since the fluid was empty in the first place, so I'd been keeping my eye on it and I had to fill it up again a few days later.  Then one day (the third time I topped off the coolant fluid) I started it and it stalled in idle, and wouldn't start up again. It's been broken down since. I've been able to start it a couple times since for just seconds at a time, and I'll give it gas and it seems to be getting the gas but the RPMs just immediately drop and it stalls out.

I've tried to google the symptoms and I went and bought a haynes manual, but I'm a bit lost. Most of the google results seem to suggest it might be the IACV. More than likely I will have to have it taken into the shop, but I thought I'd ask here for opinions in addition to some auto-savvy people I know in town. I don't think it is the alternator/starter/battery as the power seems fine and seems like it wants to turn just fine.

Thoughts? Advice?
TL;DR: Possible radiator leak, truck was stalling while idling in park, also engine block shaking in park, now truck immediately stalls if/when it starts at all

EDIT: Although the radiator was losing fluid (only when driving, not while parked) once I noticed it was empty in the first place it never again ran dry as I was only driving it a few blocks at a time and kept my eye on it to make sure it was never out again.

EDIT2: It never overheated while it was running"

2009 Chrysler Town & Country driver window stuck down
My wife was using the power window to roll the window down when she heard something like glass shatter, and the window just slowly slid down on its own.  We bought it used 6 months ago and I figured I'd take a stab at determining the problem.

Thus far I have removed the driver side panel, and removed the nuts and screws which hold the inner panel in place, the one the speaker and all electronics are mounted to.  Unfortunately I can't get it to come loose.  There's a rubber circle on the left hand side which I've popped open, from here I can see the window, and what appears to be plastic tied to the inner panel.  I cannot determine how to get the inner panel off.

I have found some online guides and videos, but they're for older or newer models, and not everything is lining up like I would expect.

I know the power window motor works, it's like some cable connected to gears or something broke.  Anyways, any insight on removing inner panel is appreciated.

Edit:  For reference, this is what I am trying to remove.  The hole on the left is what is giving me grief.  I realize now I made an error in how I removed the power window regulator, but if I could get the panel off I'd be all set.

Scraping/grinding noise when accelerating
Hello!

My 2017 Dodge Grand Caravan is making a grinding/scraping noise when I accelerate at low speeds. Seems to go away completely on the freeway. It had felt like my tires were spinning when turning and accelerating quickly, so got new tires and that didn't fix it.

My husband was testing it out and purposely revved it several times at low speed, and the issue is very suddenly much worse. Makes the sound every time he accelerates now, but still not at freeway speeds. 

The sound seems to be coming just from the left front tire area, where we also had replaced some suspension stuff after running over an object in the road last year. 

In park, nothing happens. In drive, also happens when braking and accelerating, AND in drive, when braking and turning the steering wheel. 

Any advice on diagnosing?"

I visited the Ford Dealership today to ask what it might be, and they told me there was no way they could tell me what it is without me paying to replace the parts. 

Any idea what this is or how a car wash could have caused it? Also, who should I go to to get it fixed? It is smooth to the touch and does not seem to move if you poke or push on it (it's pretty sturdy so it is hard to tell if they move). "

Trailer lights, without towing package?
2012 Chevy Traverse, it has hitch and 7 pin connector for trailer lights, but apparently does not have all necessary connections in the fuse box. There is a few fuse spots that are labeled ""Trlr"" but they only have one side of the connection and therefore no fuse. 

The 7 pin harness for the trailer lights only would allow brake lights and turn signals to work. I still needed running/ taillights and marker lights. After checking the wiring i spliced a wire from my vehicle taillight into the taillight harness for trailer, and it worked.

 It seems perfectly fine...my question is, will this cause an issue and should i use a higher amp fuse, or install a relay or something. Its currently a 10 amp fuse, and works, i just don't wanna burn a whole entire circuit. I was reading about how to add in a whole circuit and fuse dedicated for trailer taillights only, but not sure how exactly because of the ecu is only programed for what it is. "

2003 Pontiac Aztek misfiring/poor acceleration
Hello, r/autorepair!
First time poster but here it goes

I have an Aztek that gets me to work and back, but it misfires horribly when starting cold (i.e. in the morning heading to work) and has really poor performance on the highway. If it hasn't had 5ish minutes to warm up in the morning, when I hit the accelerator the car hesitates so bad it almost stalls. It only wants to put out very low power to the wheels. Once it has warmed up, when accelerating it puts out good power for a second, then slightly backs off for a second, repeating all while accelerating. 

2003 Pontiac Aztek
3.4L V6
124206 miles

It's given me two DTCs, P0300 and P1133. It's had a few codes earlier in its life that I don't remember exactly, but they all (including P1133) have vacuum leak as a symptom. I don't know if that's because that's the problem or if it's because vacuum leak can cause anything. 

So far I've
- Checked the air filter (last time I had performance issues it was this, but this time it was totally clean) 
- Checked the MAF sensor (there was some debris but nothing changed once I cleaned it out)
- Checked the spark plug cables (two were kind of loose but no change once fixed)
- Checked the brake booster vacuum hose (it wasn't pushed in all the way, but no change once fixed)
- Replaced the MAP sensor vacuum hose (it was old and crusty, but no change)
- checked the stoppers on the other two vacuum ports on the intake manifold. Both looked good.

At this point I'm not really sure what to check next. There's still the fuel pressure regulator and the PCV hose in the vacuum system, and it could be as simple as worn out spark plugs, though they're not easy to get to on an Aztek so I haven't checked them yet. Looking for advice on what to look at next. Thanks, all!"

Now, when I try the reset again, the security light doesn’t flash or go solid at all; it just stays off. Also, I’ve noticed my battery seems to be getting weak from doing this over and over. The power windows are slowing down, and the dash gauges flicker, so I’m guessing voltage is dropping. I’ve checked the fuses labeled EMS-1, IPC, and ACC/IGC, and they look fine, but I’m not sure if the issue is with the ignition switch, the BCM, Passlock sensor, or something else entirely. Any input or similar experiences would really help. I’m open to anything at this point."

My car has started making screeching/stratching noises whenever I brake/slow down or turn my wheel. What could the issue be? (2006 Honda Accord SE)
I have a 2006 Honda Accord and it has started to make ain't screeching/stratching noises. Doing some google research, it seems to narrow down to a couple of potential answers, like possibly a power steering issue. 

But I want to make sure I know 100% what it could be before I take certain steps. While I'm considering taking it to a shop, I want to see if I can save a couple dollars from inspection fees and maybe narrow down the issue. 

Here's some facts to consider:

- I recently got new tires and got some alignment and balancing done (5 days ago as of this post) 

- The same shop also tested my brakes and said that they were in very good condition (this is a very reputable, franchise shop btw) 

- I have driven all 5 days since, nearly 1000km (600 miles), yet I've only heard those sounds for 2 of those days, both towards the end of my driving for the day

- I've looked under the car and noticed a part my heat shield may be sagging a bit. I've dealt with a hanging heat shield in the past but it would only stratch when I went over speed bumps - it wouldn't make sounds when I brake or turn. Could that be the culprit of this particular problem or would this be a totally separate issue? "

2004 Sienna at traffic stops - no hot air in winter and overheating in summer
I have a 2004 Toyota Sienna and during the winter months, don't get hot air in the cabin with the heater on when stopped at traffic lights. During the summer months have noticed the temperature gauge on the dash board creeping up towards the overheating zone when stopped at lights, particularly with the AC on. The radiator fans are coming on when stopped. I was in the driveway yesterday with the water temp gauge near overheating and by merely shifting into reverse and drive to move the car to park in the street the temp returned to normal. I wasn't moving fast enough to generate additional air flow and wanted to mention this. I am thinking the winter/summer issue are related. Could there be a common cause for both these? Thank you."

All 6 Ignition Coil codes popping up at once ? Any advice or Help is welcome
Hello, When I was parking in a tight spot, it was hot day and I heard a small pop and how I have all 6 ignition coil P035X codes coming and going in my OBD2 app. I took it the mechanic who inspected and said everything was fine but I am looking to take it in to another mechanic for second opinion and see if the coils + spark plugs need replacing.  
  
When i clear the codes it drives well and fine until in like 100-150 miles when the code pops up again and repeat. can this be a wiring harness issue or a ground or a fuse issue. I saw in the Volvo owner's forum that due to the engine cover heat might be trapped, causing wiring issues.  
  
Car is a 2009 Volvo XC70 T6 with 190K miles and Carfax indicates fuses, plugs and coils changed at 167K Miles. Any help or guidance is appreciated, thanks

I am looking to sell this car but let's see, cheers."

After swapping it out again I cannot get the car to shift out of park nor get the brake lights to work…. We can stick a paper clip into the plug that goes into the switch and get the brake lights to work. Any ideas on what the issue can be?

QX30 issues
Got a used 2018 AWD Infiniti QX30 last year. It’s been an absolute pleasure so far, drove up and through the Rockies in the middle of winter without a problem. Recently, I’ve been having a few issues that keep coming back and I’m looking at anyone who may have had one or more of the same.

Some issues:

1. Remote start stopped working one day all of a sudden. If I do the same key combo on my fob while sitting inside the car, the car starts ‘remotely’. If I do it from outside the battery starts but there’s no ignition, the side mirror lights blink thrice and mirrors fold and the battery turns back off. It used to remote start even in -40 C (I live in Saskatchewan, go figure!) but the day it stopped remote starting from when I was outside the car, it never worked again. Changed my key fob battery to no avail.
2. ICC randomly sometimes gives a ‘inoperable’ status as soon as I turn on the car. So no cruise for an entire day or two sometimes. When this happens there’s a message that emergency brake is also inoperable.
3. Exiting out of low speed corners and accelerating I felt something in the back ‘wiggle’ while in the turn. Doesn’t happen after I am not turning anymore but it feels like a side to side vibration is the best way I can describe it.
4. Check engine light comes on randomly, and diagnostic messages include barometric malfunction and sometimes oxygen sensor malfunction. Then randomly both go away.
5. Key not detected. The first 6 months of having this car I never got this issue , but now it happens 75% of the time even if the key is right next to the push start button. I have to press the buttons on the fob a few times before the car will detect the key in range and then let me start. I feel like issue is possibly connected with issue 1."

Wheel grinding that got worse after replacing brake pads
2014 2WD GMC Sierra 1500

This was my second time replacing brake pads and my fiances first, so it's possible we could have missed something. 

Fiance noticed a grinding sound when braking. Today we replaced his brake pads. His old brake pads actually were still pretty ok, and evenly worn. His rotors are nearly perfect. Slide pins are mobile, pistons moved when we applied pressure, and there was good clearance between the rotor and back plate. 

We cleaned everything that was not rubber with brakleen and re-greased the slide pins. We also replaced the abutment clips and made sure they were seated properly so the brake pads had some clearance from the rotors. 

After reassembling his brakes, the grinding is actually worse than before. It can be heard (quietly) while not braking. His brakes work fine. Could this be a wheel bearing issue? If so, why would it have gotten worse after replacing the brake pads? "

2001 VW Passat 1.8t Manual - dying on long trips
I apologize for the lengthy write-up ahead of time, but I want to be as thorough as possible! 

So here goes:
I bought a 2001 VW Passat Wagon with the 1.8T and a 5-speed manual a few weeks ago. The car has no rust and only 78k miles. Everything felt great when I test drove, but I bought it knowing that occasionally the check engine light would come on because of a P0456 code (EVAP System Leak detected (very small leak)).

I drove the car 4.5 hours home with no issues at all. A couple days later I took it on a 3 hour round trip, again with no issues. During this time I was driving it on everything from highways at up to 85mph to Boston suburbs traffic with no issues. A week after I bought it I had to make a 6hr drive for work. About 4.5hrs in, I'm on the highway cruising at about 75mph/3k RPM and it's like someone disconnected the gas pedal from the car. I pumped the gas and got nothing, so the car was just coasting. I downshifted a couple times and I could grab some gas the first few times, but eventually it got to the point where I never got acceleration back and I just coasted to the side of the road. I was then able to give it 10 minutes of being off, restart it and get a little further down the road until I got to a shop. This entire time the car never showed that it was overheated, no check engine light- nothing else at all felt/sounded/looked weird. No leaking fluids.

The first shop- they couldn't get the car to recreate the same issue. They found that it wouldn't rev above 4k RPM (something I didn't test while limping it to the shop). They also said that the exhaust system showed to be 100 degrees hotter than the engine temp that was normal. They said they saw the P0456 code but also got a P0420 code (Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold Bank 1). They removed the front cat and let the car run and it still didn't change the issue. They put the cat back on and in the end installed a new O2 sensor. They also installed a new Mass Airflow sensor but said it didn't really make a huge difference, so I opted for them to throw the old one back in to save on the repair cost. They said they couldn't find the issue but felt I could limp it to my home shop. So I carefully drove it 6 hours home and felt no issues at all. The last 15 minutes of the drive, I gave it some juice and the car felt perfect- revved over 5k RPM no issue and felt totally normal.

I took it to my local shop and they found the P0420 cat code, a P1128 ""system too lean"" code, ad the P0456 small evap leak code. They replaced a diverter valve that wasn't holding vacuum to fix the EVAP code. They cleared the check engine light and looked into everything I had said and felt confident that what they did would fix the issue. It did not. I drove around town the next day ad the check engine light came back on, and a day or two later I drove 90 minutes, and with 5 minutes left of the drive I lost acceleration. This time it actually stalled out the engine while driving 55mph in 5th gear. I let the car roll in neutral, turned it off and on again, and I was able to drive the last 5 minutes without issue, though the car wouldn't rev above 4k RPM anymore.

Now the car is back home with me and works perfectly for short drives around town, but I am scared to take it on long trips (which I need to do semi-frequently). The check engine light is back on and my OBDII scanner shows the following codes:- P0420 - Catalyst System Efficiency Below Threshold Bank 1- P0456 - EVAP System Leak Detected (very small leak)- P0171 - System too lean Bank 1
That is all of the information I have on the issues happening, and I would truly LOVE some insight. The car is perfect aside from this one big issue, and I'd love to be able to keep the car and daily it. Thank you so much for any insight you can give. Attached below is a photo just for looks!"

Toyota Rav 4 repair
Hi all. I need some help/advice.

My Toyota Rav 4 2.2 diesel recently broke down. Had it recovered and booked in to a garage for diagnostics/repair.

No 1 injector was leaking and have had the Injector replaced with a genuine Toyota injector. 

However, the garage that done the repair have said that they could not finish doing the coding of the injector. The injector was coded but they were unable to do the pilot settings and that it is locked to main dealer. Said he tried to do it on 3 different machines.

I have been to Toyota and they have said it could take 2 hours to do and there’s no guarantee they would be able to do and that it could take longer and I would be liable to charges even if they can’t do it. I don’t want to pay 2+ hours at main dealer rates when there’s no guarantee they can even do it. They also said that the garage I had it done at should be able to do it and that it’s not locked to main dealer. Was also told that the car might not run properly without it being done and that it could go into limp mode.

The car seems to be driving ok, but I have only driven a mile or so since the repair.

So the question is, do I need to get this done? Will it cause any issue if I don’t? Why have the mains dealer said they can’t guarantee they can do it? Is it not just a case of plugging in a machine and pressing a few buttons to code it? 

I hope this all makes sense, I don’t really know too much about cars."

I am getting the dreaded P0172 code
I recently bought a Chevy Sonic LT 1.6 l (only produced in Mexico, where I live). The test drive was smooth, a little hesitation but a generally smooth ride. I listened pretty carefully under the hood. Did not perceive any vacuum leaks by ear or other weird noises. Hoses, belts and such looked ok. First thing I did was I changed the oil, did a coolant flush, changed the timing belt/tensors and the three ""retenes"" (I do not know how they are called in English), which were leaking. I guess the guy who sold the car to me reset the ECU because after a few kms, the CEL came on. A scan threw P0300, P0173, C0561. The last code is for the ABS so I figured that one would disappear if the others were dealt with. I checked the spark plugs, and they were clean, not white, nor black which I thought they might be because of the P0173 (I am not a mechanic but I know some basic stuff). I changed the plugs anyway. cleaned the MAF and took the car to a mechanic to clean the injectors, which he did with a pressurized can. He reset the ECU and I drove the car through its cycles, and it ran smooth, better than before. But I still got a P0172. A real-time scan by the same mechanic showed the only anomalous reading LTFT = -29 and fluctuating. Oxygen sensors fine, and other parameters that I am not familiar with he told me were ok. He suggested I replace the MAF, which I did. It is a BOSCH.

OK, here are my questions. Since the mechanic already reset the ECU after the scan, and since I drove the car only about 10kms to get the MAF, I figured I did not need to disconnect the battery or anything because the ECU was just reset so no need. Just popped the MAF in. I let the car idle for ten minutes then drove it \~25kms. Very smooth ride, engine idles at around 800 and no hesitation. But should I have disconnected the battery to reset the ECU again?



Second question: the car ran fine from the first test drive. If it wasn't for the CEL going on, I would never have noticed a problem. Why did I get those codes without any synptoms? I know the CEL goes on if the Trim goes out of the -25 to 25 range. So I am assuming the issue was not severe."

2016 Civic Starting Problem
Hi there! I have a 2016 Civic EX that has developed a starting problem. It seems to be completely random but sometimes I'll press the button to start and all I will hear is the click of the solenoid/relay with a complete no-crank, the starter won't even try. Some days it starts up no problem, some days it will take 3-5 button pushes to get it to crank. Time of day and whether it's hot or cold seems to have no effect. When it DOES crank, it's full speed and sounds healthy (not sluggish like a battery issue). It starts up every time/like normal when it does crank. 

The battery and alternator tests fine according to a tester I have (not one of those large resistive types at auto parts stores). The car has 147k miles on it. The battery is a Superstart Extreme, probably 3-4 years old at this point. 

Anybody have ANY idea or suggestions to try before throwing a new starter or battery at it?"

Fiesta 1.0 intermittent crankshaft sensor code
2018 1.0L Fiesta - ~36000 miles 

This morning I took my garage to a garage as I had a P0339 sensor code (intermittent signal). As soon as I got in they asked a few questions and said “probably the wet belt” without even seeing the car. It rubbed me the wrong way as it’s an expensive part to replace and to say it without even looking yet seems bias. 

I am wondering if they come back and say it needs doing what questions should I be asking/checking for them to have determined it’s not just the sensor being dodgy? I admittedly cleared the code the first time this came up in case a bad start tripped it, and it went away for around 1-2 months, just wanted it replaced so it doesn’t cause further issues.

Rodent Eating Car Wires 3 Times in 2 Months
Hi! As the title says, I’ve been having a rodent issue and my car wires have been completely eaten through three times within 2 months. 

I’ve tried using rodent repellent and bounce sheets, however they came back and even took some of the bounce sheets with them. I’m not sure if it’s the same rodent or if it’s mice, rats or squirrels.

I live in a very squirrel/ rat populated area and have to park on the road. I usually park at the side of the house, however moved to the front of the house after the second time of the wires being chewed. So I’m not sure how far away I need to park for them to stop. 

There doesn’t seem to be any nests or anything, they just come for a sweet treat and leave. I drive my car everyday so it’s not sitting long periods (this quite literally happens over night). My cars clean and I never leave food or garbage in it. I’m not sure what else I can do and it’s getting quite expensive to repair all the time.

Dealership Scam?
I have a 2020 RAV4 XLE Premium w/ 20k miles and brought my car to the dealership (NYC) for an engine message showing up on the dash. The message ended up being a coolant bypass valve replacement that was covered by toyota (which I've seen previous posts about).

The issue is that now there have suddenly been 2k worth of ""recommended"" repairs. The list is as follows:

* Brake pad/rotor replacement **$852** (Front only)
* Brake Fluid Service **$300**
* Cabin Air Filter Replacement **$140** (Just replaced 6 months ago, but estimate is high)
* A/C Evaporator Cleaning Service **$240** (BS)
* Steam Clean Engine **$210** (BS?)
* EFI Fuel Injector Cleaning Service **$400** (I dont believe this)

Some of these recommendations I can tell are BS since there isn't much justification beyond ""toyota recommends.""

I'm just not able to confirm whether the brake stuff is a legitimate concern or not. I took a look at the photos in their report and couldn't see the pads at all, it was just a photo of the rotors. Not sure what im supposed to look for in the rotors. The dealership already feels very scammy and suspicious sometimes, but I am not too experienced and would like some thoughts.

Thanks!"

Mechanic says I need new engine, should I believe them?
hey everyone!
looking for some advice on a no start issue that’s been tough to figure out.

we’ve got a 2011 buick regal that’s been sitting for about 2 years after it suddenly stopped starting. now when we try to start it, the engine cranks strong, sounds like it wants to start, but never actually fires. no sputtering or backfiring, just clean cranking with no ignition.

we took it to the mechanic and paid for 2 hours of diagnostics. they said that:
- fuel and ignition systems are working
- wiring looks intact
- no codes from the scan
- scoped the engine and saw some nicks on the piston head

based on that, they told us they suspect internal damage and recommended a full engine replacement. we asked if they were sure and they said not 100%, and they’d need more hours and money to know for sure. i’m just hoping to get some advice on what to do next because it felt like a bit of a jump to go from not knowing exactly what is causing the car to not start to the car needing the engine replaced. but the car’s maybe worth $4k (was bought for $9,000), so we’re ready to scrap it if the engine is truly shot.

would love a second opinion or any ideas on what might actually be going on. thanks in advance!"

2013 Durango Problems
I just bought a retired police Durango with 75000 miles on it. I took it to the mechanic to replace the drive belt as it was old and to address a small oil leak, the car also makes a loud clunking/crunching noise when turning, braking and going over bumps. The mechanic said that the suspension looked good and that the problem was likely related to something in the steering. I'm not too sure what it could be if not the suspension and I'm not familiar with issues for the car. He also said the oil is leaking from the rear main seal, is it worth it to replace it or is it fine to use an additive to repair the seal? Overall he said I'd be looking at about $3-4k in repairs. Thanks in advance for the help"

2013 Malibu Power Issues
Sunday evening went to run errands and my car wouldn't unlock with key fab or start. There was no power at all. I jump started it and drove it for 20 minutes and then pulled in driveway turned it off started again immediately and it started. I went out to start it again before I went to bed and it start right up. 

Next morning (Monday) I go to leave for work my doors unlocked with key fab but when I got in the brake was tough to push and when I hit the push button start there was a faint sound of it trying to do something but wouldn't turn over. So I take my wife's car to work come home from work try to start nothing. I jump it again it starts right up. I took it up to O'Reilly's cause the battery I have I got it there about year and half ago, didn't think it was that but figured I would have it tested. He tested the battery and alternator and both came back good. I tried to start it before I went to bed to see if it would turn over or if I would need to barrow my wife's car again, it turned over. 

Tuesday morning go to leave for work car unlocked and started right up. About half way through my work shift went out to see if it would start and it did. Then when I left work got into car and it wouldn't turn over, faint sound again of trying to. I had a hand held jumper unit I barrowed that I had with me. I hooked it up and it took a minute but finally started. I drove to a shop that has worked on my car multiple times before and they tested the battery, alternator and starter and all came back good. He told me they could do a diagnostic test but since there was nothing lighting up on the dash like an engine light or anything I could be paying for something that may not bring any codes back and therefor would be no further ahead. The test was not cheap so I said not to do it for now. One other thing to add is my locks sometimes will just go up and down for a few and then stop. The button on the driver side door handle that you can push to lock or unlock the car stopped working a little while ago as well. Sorry for the long explanation of what's going on with my car but wanted to give as much info as I could so hopefully someone might know what's going on.  Thanks in advance for any help."

Steel Horse Trailer?
Needing Help

 I embarked on a 22ft horse trailer that was riddled with rust/ pitting, and rot. Long story short, l've stripped, replaced, weld patched, etc and now have gotten to the point of somewhat finishing it up.

I have so far:
1. Obvious prep work
2. Hit with Rustoleum Primer
3. Sanded with 220 to knock primer smooth
4. Rolled on the Rustoleum Professional Gloss White paint using a 4"" roller, turned out pretty great for what it is.
5. Another coat of white paint rolled on
+ Got everything painted and sanded, ready to clear now.

That's pretty much it. The rust is now gone, trailer looks good, but I'm having the issue of just knowing that as soon as i throw a horse in her and start rolling down the road, the elements, etc; my 100+ hrs of manual labor is gonna go to waste on the paint, and would like to seal/ top coat it.

My question, what would work good on top of the oil based Rustoleum. I have heard of the whole 2K stuff, my problem is that I don't have a paint sprayer, and have absolutely no experience on mixing stuff and spraying. Will most likely get something cheaper (it’s a horse trailer, don’t have to be perfect) like the speedokote 2k clear on a 250 dollar airless sprayer.

Trailer so far has turned out amazing thus far, but i want that extra lil bit of gloss touch to her.
Anyone have any experience? Recommend me something before i go nuts?"

Grounding Issue?
Have a 2003 Toyota sienna Symphony. About 253,000 miles on it. Last week the battery light came up randomly. Got a new battery, but the light is still on. The alternator is new (last year) but I checked the voltage anyway and it’s just about the 13.5 mark. 

When I hook my portable jumpstart to the battery, the van starts fine, but if I remove either the positive or negative clips, it dies immediately. The strange thing is, I don’t have to turn the portable jumpstarter on. 

The ground cables that I can trace don’t look chewed or corroded. I also checked the alternator fuse and it is still good. All this being said, does this sound like a grounding issue? "

Causes of water condensation in fuel tank
After heavy rain, my car experiences misfires, rough running, and occasional stalling. I initially suspected electrical issues and systematically replaced every component in the ignition system - coil, wires, plugs - and inspected all engine wiring harnesses. I’ve also replaced the O2 sensors, MAF sensor, and just about everything else I could think of.

My current theory is that water is entering the fuel system due to condensation. Why? Because these issues only arise after a heavy downpour - not during. I can drive through large puddles of water, or even hose down the engine bay with no problems. But a day after heavy rain or high humidity, it runs poorly - especially when the gas tank is low. All these signs point to condensation in the fuel tank. I’ve already replaced the gas cap and inspected the fuel filler neck - no damage there.

But what I can’t figure out is why this is happening now, after 25 years of owning this Kia with no previous issues like this.

One possible clue is a persistent P0455 code: “Large EVAP Leak.” I’ve inspected the EVAP system, including all lines leading up to the evap canister, and I have removed and checked the canister close valve (vent valve). I pulled a vacuum on all the lines, fixed minor leaks, but I found no large leaks. I've concluded that the evap leak is on the tank itself.

My concern is whether an EVAP leak like this could realistically allow moisture into the fuel system via condensation - and if that’s worth dropping the tank to investigate. Any insights or similar experiences would be greatly appreciated."

AAMCO Technicians STUMPED (And I'm out $1,500)
Hi all — hoping someone here can shed some light on this. My 2016 Ford Mustang EcoBoost is throwing a persistent **P0717 code** (Input/Turbine Speed Sensor “A” No Signal), and even after **replacing the sensor**, the issue came back almost immediately. AAMCO has now had the car for two more full days and can’t identify what’s still wrong. I’m stuck without a car and would hugely appreciate any insights from this community.

**Vehicle:**

* 2016 Ford Mustang EcoBoost
* 4-cylinder, 2.3L turbocharged
* Automatic transmission (6R80)

**Background & What’s Been Done:**

* My usual mechanic pulled the **P0717 code** and confirmed that the speed sensor in this car is located inside the transmission, integrated into the **lead frame (conductor plate)**.
* They referred me to AAMCO, who:
   * Removed the transmission pan
   * Found clean fluid and no debris
   * Replaced the **OEM conductor plate / lead frame** (includes the input speed sensor)
   * **Reinstalled the Transmission Control Module (TCM)** as part of reassembly
   * Topped off fluid and filter
   * Charged \~$1,500 for the work
* As soon as I left the lot, the car **lurched into gear**, threw the **same wrench light**, and repeated the original issue.

# Current Symptoms:

**Acceleration**

* When I step on the gas, the engine will sometimes rev with **no acceleration**.
* The car will then suddenly **lurch into gear**, sometimes causing the wheels to chirp.
* These events are almost always followed by the **wrench light**.
* When coasting, the car doesn’t decelerate naturally.
* This behavior happens **most often after the car sits for a few hours** (cold start).
* Also — we’ve been having **very hot weather** lately, in case that matters.

**A/C Fan Fluctuation**

* For several months before the P0717 showed up, the **A/C blower fan would randomly surge or dip in speed** without touching controls.

**iPhone Overheating Warning**

* Once, while charging my iPhone in the car, I received a **“temperature warning”** on the phone.
* Could be unrelated, but it’s never happened in that position in my car before.

**Diagnostic Procedures Reported (per AAMCO):**

* **Transmission fluid:** Clean, full, no odor or debris
* **Input speed sensor resistance:** Tested out of spec (justified replacement)
* **Alternator:** Reportedly tested under load and at startup — “checked out”
* **Test drives:** They’ve driven the car multiple times but **cannot replicate the issue**
* **TCM:** Physically reinstalled during reassembly, but unclear whether any adaptive reset or relearning was performed

Meanwhile, **every time I drive it**, the problem returns within minutes.

**Other Notes:**

* I installed a **new battery about a year ago**. The install seemed fine, and the car has run well since — but I mention it in case a loose connection or grounding issue is affecting voltage delivery.

**My Theory (as a non-expert):**

While I know the input speed sensor was replaced, I keep thinking this is **electrical**:

* Maybe the **alternator is intermittently faulting**, and it just hasn’t happened while under test?
* Maybe it’s a **wiring or connector issue** — something degrading signal to the TCM or sensor intermittently?
* I wonder if the **TCM wasn’t reset or adapted** after installing the new lead frame?

It feels like AAMCO isn’t super eager to keep chasing it down since they’ve already done the repair and been paid. So I’m here, hoping someone has seen this before.

Any thoughts or next steps I could suggest to the shop?

Thanks in advance!"

2014 Dodge Journey problems are either going to be expensive, or crazy expensive. Please & thank you in advance.
I'll try to be succinct.

2014 Dodge Journey
2.4L 4cyl
4-speed automatic

When I'm cruising at a particular speed & I want to accelerate, the car stutters like it's trying to find the right gear OR like the cylinders are not firing in their correct timing. Or, if I'm cruising & drop down a few miles for whatever reason if I try to accelerate back to my usual cruising speed it does the same.

Seems like the fastest way to solve this is by hitting the gas harder & dropping down a gear. Once I'm at the speed I want I let it shift back up by letting up on the gas a little. It's been doing this for 2 years now & I'm finally taking it in on Saturday to get looked at, I just want to have the right info & language to relay the issue to my mechanic, since there are no ODB2 alerts & I can't figure out Torque Pro enough to narrow down the problem.

It 100% feels like a transmission thing, but it 95% feels like it could be an air/fuel mixture or timing issue."

2016 Ford Escape AC Issue

Toyota Aygo 2010 indicators only work when held down….
Other issues with the car include: Heater working but aircon doesn’t blow out cold air, more like a fan. I also think there’s an issue with the radio with it not fully reacting when I press the volume buttons. I think I may have fixed this however with the fuse being replaced. 

I’ve tried to replace the fuses for the relevant issues with the car for the air-con and indicator related issues but that did not turn out successful. 

The answer for the indicator fix will most likely be to replace the stalk but I’ve watched YouTube videos and I just don’t rly feel confident to attempt it myself based off what I saw. But the car is a piece of junk and probably not even worth the cost of replacing the stalk. So I’m looking for possible other options to try that people may know. Even if it’s just a temporary fix. 

Thanks!

Drove car for about 35 miles already and the problem has not returned. Is my car fixed?
2006 Mitsubishi Lancer ES 2.0L

I had a stalling low idle rpm issue caused by a failed gasket allowing coolant to seep from the coolant compartment onto the idle air control valve compartment fouling the idle air control valve so it got stuck extended. My mechanic replaced the leaking gasket and replaced the idle air control valve. He kept the car for a couple of days and test drove it for about 10 miles and told me I can come pick it up. I drove it for an additional 25 miles these last couple of days and the car has been running for about 2 hours total for those 25 miles (lots of stop and go traffic because I drive in Los Angeles) so the car has had time to warm up. I also left it idling for 10 minutes straight not doing anything to see if there would be any issues and it held steady at 700 rpm. If this was your car how confident are you that the issue has been fixed or how many more miles or time do I need to put in to confirm a successful repair?"

Intermittent Power Steering Cause?
I have a 2013 Ram 1500 and within the last month the power steering has stopped  working sometimes when I turn it on. I can restart it and usually within a few attempts, it will kick back on. I got a new battery hoping it was some issue there and that seemed to fix it for a few days but now it's back to working only sometimes (and seemingly to progressively take longer). 

I took it to the nearest shop (not necessarily one I trust as I wasn't wanting to drive it too far) and they told me it was the rack and pinion and quoted me $3,500to fix. 

Does the diagnosis (and cost) seem right? 
Or any other ideas on what might be causing the issue?

I accidentally cut that cable off thinking I could replace it 1:1 and not worry about it. Well none of my gauges work and I think it’s something to do with that wire.

Is this corrosion on my idle air control valve and is this the reason why its not working anymore? It seems to be stuck extended and won't retract and causing the car to idle low.
2006 Mitsubishi Lancer ES 2.0L, 61,000 Miles

This idle air control valve was a brand new OEM Mitsubishi idle air control valve that was installed about 1 1/2 years ago. It started having issues like low idle rpm (500 rpm) in late April and when I took it over to my mechanic he remove it and notice that there was green coolant in the port where the idle air control valve sits (you can see the green coolant in the last picture). The idle air control valve was also not moving, it was stuck extended letting barely any air into the intake. My question is what is the white stuff on it? If that is corrosion could the reason why the 1 1/2 year old OEM idle air control valve died so quickly be because coolant got onto it and corroded it and could that happens so quickly like in only about a year?

I was able to get a used OEM Mitsubishi idle air control valve from someone on eBay and its currently installed on my car. I picked the car up and it ran good.

Front lower control brushing incidental replacement?
Front lower control brushing replacement?

Hello.  Have a Honda pilot 2017. 72k miles. Went for a warranty service to the dealership and they incidentally (unrelated to why I took it) said the “front lower control arm brushing” was worn out and should be replaced. $1600.   Plus alignment afterward etc.  

We normally use a Honda independent mechanic and he never has mentioned this.  Here’s the photo she showed me. 

Does this sound like a legit issue?  Part of me wants to think the dealership is trying to make some $. But then I’m also disappointed the regular mechanic wouldn’t say anything.  Is it possible this isn’t too critical (unless the car is making noise etc?)

Im sure if I ask my mechanic about this, they’ll gladly charge me a hefty sum and replace it too. "

P1b25 High Voltage Battery Path Fault
It was about time I needed a new 12v battery on my 2015 Kia Optima Hybrid Ex so I went ahead and replaced it. Was driving around the very same day and about 5 hours later the acceleration to the car cut off and I could no longer drive the vehicle; luckily I was around the corner from my home. 

This is when EVERYTHING started happening. 
once I pulled over and turned vehicle off. Lights would come onto the dash but the vehicle wouldn’t flip over to “ready” and I was getting hybrid warning messages to turn off vehicle to prevent hybrid damage. That very same evening the same 12V I had just bought that same day was already drained dead. I was under assumption I would need to change Hybrid Battery. 

Fast forward a few months since then. Had my mechanic run some codes. He pulled 1 code which was p1b25. And here I am; I did extensive digging and realized it could be the High Voltage Fuse so I ordered the new part and put it in( I got entire housing not just the fuse and replaced the High Voltage Fuse Orange housing as well) ; and the vehicle was flipping over to ready while I had the dead battery on jumper cables. 

I went down the rabbit hole of getting a new 12v battery to see if the battery being fully juiced would help the gas powered engine kick on. Got nothing. 

Now after switching both High Voltage Fuse and 12V battery; vehicle doesn’t send me any hybrid warnings anymore. Instead; Now I’m receiving “check charging system” warnings and “stop vehicle to charge battery” when the car won’t even go anywhere (lol) and the engine still won’t turn on. Vehicle still wont accelerate. 

What should my next steps be? I’ve seen some people say that the p1b25 code either means 12v battery; the fuse; or the power relay. The only two things I haven’t fixed is the power relay nor the hybrid battery itself

Just don’t want to continue down a rabbit hole if I need to fix the hybrid battery. I’ve also seen some posts of people saying they fixed their hybrid battery and it still didn’t resolve these similar issues. 

Any advice with similar circumstances and what fixed the problem for you would be greatly appreciated and of tremendous help!

My battery died roughly two weeks ago which was fine - so I replaced it myself then after a week of driving that was all fine

Today I went to start my car and it seems like the battery is dead again. No lights left on, nothing - don't have a kit to jump start either so a little annoying.

(I also replaced the alternator when I first got the car as well)

Headlights don't come on - lights don't work - dash flickers and makes a ticking noise when trying to start the car.

Need advice/thoughts/feedback on repairs for 1998 Lexus ES and 2008 Avalon XLS
Hi, I am very frustrated with my car repair situation. We have a 1998 Lexus ES and a 2008 Avalon. The Lexus has 112,049 miles on it, and the Avalon has 72,096 miles. I am single, live in Florida and I  work from home. My mother currently lives with me and is disabled and not in good health. We get along well, and have a good amount of separate, independent living space and individual privacy, however she is disabled and cannot walk or get out of her bed without my help. We live a quiet life and have almost everything delivered (Instacart for all groceries, and Amazon and Walmart deliveries for most everything else). Currently, I just drive for nearby errands such as pharmacy, bank, post office, and medical appointments as I try not to be gone for long periods of time being concerned  my mother might need my help. Several years ago I put the cars on battery tender, and a few years ago I moved them out of the garage to make space to store some items, but am easy to clear out the garage again and get the cars back in. Initially, it seemed the alternator went bad on the Lexus, as I could only get it to start with a battery jump device , but it would quickly go off. I then began using only the Avalon before the same thing occurred. I ordered new alternators from Amazon for both cars and also had Walmart deliver new batteries for both cars. Since my father passed and I took over care of the cars, I would initially take them to Sears Auto Shop (when they were still in business), as this is where my father had taken them. I grew frustrated whenever one of the cars needed a part, all they said they could get me was a “refurbished” part. After getting my own new parts, I was going to try a service where a mechanic comes to your home and repairs your cars. They said on the website that you could have your own new parts installed, an just pay labor, but if that part didn’t function properly you would then also have to pay for them to get a replacement part and additional labor to install. They also said that if you did have your own parts installed there would be no warranty on the part or labor. I thought this was fair (after all, garages were offering me “refurbished” parts and only a one year part and labor warranty). I felt it was worth a try. However, scheduling two cars for the mechanic that comes to your home was complicated, so I decided to use mu USAA Roadside Assistance to have the cars towed to our local Toyota dealer’s garage. Initially, the service manager told me they have a strict policy against using outside parts. I voiced my concern with only being offered “refurbished parts” in the past and told him that the new parts were already in two bags in the front passenger seats of each car, along with a detailed letter of what I experienced with the cars and believe the issues to be, and printouts from the Amazon website about each parts, and showing that they were “appropriate fits” for the cars. However, I told him I respect their policy and that he could just ignore the parts. I fid tell him that the Lexus was missing front hood Struts, and that I had a new pair in the bag of new parts.
He later texted me and said he would make exceptions for some of the parts – bur definitely not the alternator. He said they needed the front struts and a battery installed on the Lexus to test the alternator and could use my parts and charge $50 labor for the strut install and $26 labor for battery install. He also said that the Avalon needed a new battery, and that they could also use the new one I had sent in with the car (just pay an additional $26 labor for the install), I also approved that, as well. 
He said the alternator was bad on the Lexus, as well as many other things that I wasn’t expecting. He said the Lexus also needs brakes and tires are pretty bad -  cracked and almost flat, brake rotors very rusty. None of this was apparent to me before I had the car towed in for service.
This was the results/recommendations of the Lexus test:
Alternator Replacement: ALTERNATOR FAILED LOAD TEST, REPLACEMENT REQUIRED (QUOTED AFTERMARKET ALTERNAOTOR, NEEDS TO BE ORDERED) (WILL INSTALL CUSTOMERS OWN SUPPLIED DRIVE BELT WITH ALTERNATOR REPLACEMENT)
$650.99
Tires- 4: REPLACE 4 TIRES- ALL TIRES ARE DRYROTTING QUOTED GENERAL RELIATREK 205/65/15 (NOT IN STOCK NEED TO BE ORDERED)
$755.68
Brake Job – Front (Replace Pads and Rotors): FRONT BRAKE PADS VERY LOW, ROTORS VERY RUSTY, AND THERE IS A RISK OF CALIPERS SEIZING UP DURING REMOVAL DUE TO VEHCLE HAVING BEEN SITTING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. IF CALIPERS SEIZE DURING REMOVAL, REPLACEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED AT ADDITIONAL COST 
$522.79
Brake Job – Rear (Replace Pads and Rotors): REAR BRAKE PADS VERY LOW, ROTORS VERY RUSTY, AND THERE IS A RISK OF CALIPERS SEIZING UP DURING REMOVAL DUE TO VEHCLE HAVING BEEN SITTING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. IF CALIPERS SEIZE DURING REMOVAL, REPLACEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED AT ADDITIONAL COST
$552.79
*Coolant Flush: PREMIUM COOLING SYSTEM FLUID EXCHANGE (RK222) “SEQUOIA AND TUNDRA MODELS REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FLUID AT ADDITIONAL COST”
$169.95
*** TOTAL COST (if all recommended services are preformed:)  $2,652.20
Regarding the Avalon 
The Service Manager said that the alternator on the Avalon is working, but the 2 front tires are flat and rotors rusted from sitting. When cars sit for long periods of time, things wear out and go bad just from sitting. Then he cautioned me to keep in mind that it is hard to predict if something will go wrong as a consequence of sitting for a long time, and then start driving it again. So this is what we visibly see and suggest, but have not test driven the car as yet.
He then presented me with the results and recommendations of the Avalon test:
*He said that there wee two options for installing new tires.  Option number one (having two front tires replaced) or option number two (having all four tires replaced) – which they would recommend
I compiled two separate “total charges” at the end of the report. One for going with option number one (only two front tires replaced, and a second for going with option number two (having all four tires replaced).
Below are the test results/recommendations for the Avalon:
Tires – 2: FRONT 2 TIRES ARE FLAT AND DRY ROTTING ON ARRIVAL, NEED TO REPLACE AT LEAST FRONT 2 TIRES QUOTED GENERAL RELIATREK 215/55/17
$420.14
Tires- 4: ALL 4 TIRES ARE DRY ROTTING AND SHOULD BE REPLACED, TIRES WITH DRY ROT CRACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SITTING FOR YEARS ARE A BLOW OUT RISK WHEN DRIVING. QUOTED GENERAL RELIATREK 215/55/17
$552.07
*Alignment: WHEEL ALIGNMENT WHEN NEW TIRES INSTALLED
$149.95
Brake Job – Front (Replace Pads and Rotors): FRONT BRAKE PADS VERY LOW, ROTORS VERY RUSTY, AND THERE IS A RISK OF CALIPERS SEIZING UP DURING REMOVAL DUE TO VEHCLE HAVING BEEN SITTING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. IF CALIPERS SEIZE DURING REMOVAL, REPLACEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED AT ADDITIONAL COST  $535.39 Brake Job – Rear (Replace Pads and Rotors): REAR BRAKE PADS VERY LOW, ROTORS VERY RUSTY, AND THERE IS A RISK OF CALIPERS SEIZING UP DURING REMOVAL DUE TO VEHCLE HAVING BEEN SITTING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. IF CALIPERS SEIZE DURING REMOVAL, REPLACEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED AT ADDITIONAL COST  $552.07 *** TOTAL COST [Option #1 – 2 front tires replaced] (if all recommended services are preformed): $1,657.55 *** TOTAL COST [Option #2 – all 4 tires replaced] (if all recommended services are preformed): $1,749.48 
I remembered that we had both cars to that dealership for service a few years ago, and I told him that I hadn’t done a good job of keeping any “maintenance logs”, so I asked him to check the computer to see what we had done. It turns out it was in 2019 and at that time the Lexus got an oil change , as well as both front and rear brake jobs and the Avalon got an oil change as well as well as the lug nuts replaced, the passenger side cv axel, the brake and transmission fluids were both flushed, and the air and cannot filter were replaced. The Lexus has been our leas used car (it had111, 487 miles when it was last serviced in 2019, and at that time had a font and back break replacement. Currently, it has 112,049, meaning it gained only 562 miles in 6 years. It is difficult for me  understand how it would need new front and rear brakes again, yeats later and accruing only 562 additional miles, albeit it was sitting in my driveway (uncovered) the remainder of those six years in Florida weather. As for the Avalon (the more heavily used car of the two), in 2019 when I was last in for service, it had 64,052 miles on it, and now it has 72,096 miles, which amounts to an 8,0404 mileage increase over the past six years. According to Google, “Brake Pads: Expect to replace brake pads every 25,000 to 65,000 miles” and “Brake Rotors: Rotors typically last between 30,000 and 70,000 miles.”
The Service Manager also clarified onto the issues of calipers and beak pads/rotors. He said that when they begin to replace the break pads, the calipers may lock up when the try to compress them, and if that were to happen, they would also need to replace the broken calipers to complete the break job. He said that the risk was there hat this could happen with both cars having been sitting for so long (Which seems counterintuitive to me, as I always assumed with mechanical parts, the more you use them, the more problems or could be, and the less they are used, the fewer problems there could be.)
I asked what “wost case scenario” would cost if all of the calipers needed to also be replaced (on both cars). He estimates it could be $100 per caliper (×4) = an extra $400  (pet car) and $200 (x2) per axel for labor, which could be ab extra $400 per car. Worst case scenario would then be an additional $1,600 for both cars.
I also asked him about the tire alignment (why it was quoted on the Avalon, but nit the Lexus, when tire replacements were recommended on both vehicles).  He said whenever they install new tires, they recommend it, and said that he thought it was quoted for both vehicles.
Additionally, he said that a “break flush” should have also been recommended on the Avalon, as it was for the Lexus, because both cars had been sitting for a long time and that brake fluid is a “hydroscopic fluid”, and moisture reduces its efficacy.
Yesterday, when I expressed feeling a bit “overwhelmed”, when all I thought I was brining my car into the shop for was two battery installs, two alternator installs (turns out the Avalon didn’t even need a new alternator, just a new battery), and then got a report back of extensive tire and battery replacement issues. 
He said if I didn’t want to do everything at once, I could postpone the break jobs on the Lexus, but it might squeal, make noise and possibly feel pulsating when breaking; however the last time  drove it I experienced none if that. 
He said that the “dry rot” on the tires were more concerning from a safety standpoint; but again there was no “dry rot” or “flat tires” visible to me (on either vehicle) before they were towed to the shop.
He said that the Avalon front and rear break pads are very low at 3mm (1/8 inch), and again was focused on “dry rot” on tires, flat tires and “low on tread”.
The Service Manager also confirmed that all parts use for repairs would be “refurbished”, and come with one year parts (at least for the parts that they supplied) and labor – which I suppose is standard for the industry.
I would greatly appreciate any thoughts, comments, advice, recommendations, personal experiences, as well as “hacks” or workarounds (different ideas of doing things) that anyone has to offer. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

Praise for Auto Repair Shop
I recently created a post, just now in fact, questioning whether I was being charged unfairly, but I wanted to praise another shop “from 100 years ago.”

I took a Chevy Nova — no idea what year, I’m not a car guy, but I was a teenager and I’m 62 years old now — into a shop to have repairs done. 

They completed the work and I drove away happy.

Weeks later I had what I considered a different problem, took it back to the same shop to have it looked at.

One of the representatives there came back out with a check for $300 and said that they determined they couldn’t repair my car, and connected their inability to that prior work they’d completed (to my way of thinking) satisfactorily.

They refunded my money for the previous work and directed me to a dealership to have the work done. 

This is something I’ve never heard of happening. 

In fact, more times than not, what you see are stories of clueless people getting ripped off by dealerships or mechanics for their (insert strange Dr. Seuss imaginary auto part word here) needing repaired or some nonexistent mechanical issue that they just made up on the fly. "

2005 Mazda Tribute Burns oil like it gets paid to
Exactly what the title says. 

I got this car 1.5 years ago and it instantly had issues (spark plugs, ignition coils, wiring harness, swaybar links, abs) and while I have fixed everything that has come up, the oil burning is worse than ever. When I got the car it burnt oil a little and ever month or two I would top it up. I drive about 200K a week. Today I added a full liter even though I filled it up only a week ago.

The plan is to take it to a shop soon, but honestly this car has been a money pit and I am not keen on spending a bunch on it.

I know its burning not leaking (mechanic confirmed it last year) and there is no smell, clouds or leaks in my parking space.

A coworker suggested restore in the oil, but any ideas are appreciated. 

Thanks,

Bad ECM?
Hi all -

I have a 2012 Impala that I suspect has an issue with it's ECM. When running the car with an OBD2 reader in its port, or when clearing/reading codes, it seems to send the car into a panic and disables TC, Stabilitrack and brake assist. Removing the reader and disconnecting/reconnecting the battery allows it to function normally again. Using a reader or Torque gives me either these codes, or code U0100, which seems to be a network/CANBUS issue.

I'd just like to know A. Is this issue with its ECM as I suspect, or is there something easier/cheaper I could try first, B. Is it worth doing so, and if so, C. If anyone has done this and would recommend a place to get one. 

Thanks in advance!"

I don't like parts shopping online so I made an app that compares prices.
This is a no code app made by an AI that can record a workflow and use it to build an app. This workflow works for any kind of product. The app was made by recording my screen as I shopped for tires. I went to a website and found the tire and size I wanted. Then the app does comparisons for the stores I choose. Since it is an LLM, it is good a figuring out substitutions or letting me know of other issues."

Airbag cover issue
Hi. Today I found the cover of one of the airbags partially ripped off (probably by mistake by the technician looking for the obd port; realized it after leaving so there's not much to do about it). It's situated under the steering wheel. 

It appears like the glue (seems similar to hot glue) keeping it in place broke, but otherwise it's intact. What are my options? For the moment I put some tape to hold it, but it won't hold for long. Can I glue it back with a small amount of glue of some kind? Does it need to be replaced? I don't want to impede its functionality but I don't want to drive with the fear of something getting in there and setting it off."

Transmission
I have a 2016 Ford Escape SE. 1.6L engine. Automatic transmission. 108,000miles - I had an incident where it basically felt like it crapped out. Made it home (I was just down the road) had it towed to a mechanic. They said my transmission pump burnt out and destroyed the inside of transmission. Didnt want to pay to fix it so we towed it back home.

I’ve started the car since there - starts right up - no warning symbol, check engine etc - I am able to drive forward and reverse in my driveway with no issues. I did this maybe 10 times. Nothing happened. I don’t feel safe driving it on the road but my question is - if the transmission pump burnt up and destroyed the inside of transmission shouldn’t I not be able to move shift gears?"

Fighting a knock sensor code for 2 years — and still can’t beat it. P0333, Jaguar S-Type 2003 3.0 N/A
Hi!

I have a persistent issue with my car, and I’ve been struggling with it for over two years. I've done a lot of work trying to bring the car to perfect condition — many things have been fixed or replaced — but this one issue just won’t go away.

**The problem:**

I’m getting **error code P0333**, which refers to the **knock sensor 2 circuit high input**.  
When this happens, the car goes into **“restricted performance”** mode and limits the RPMs to 3000.

**When the error occurs**

1. The error **always** shows up **at cold start** — if the car has been sitting for several hours. The error goes away **after some time**, and the duration **depends on outside temperature**:
   * In **cold winter**, it may take 30+ minutes;
   * In **hot weather**, it usually disappears within 10 minutes.
2. If I’m driving on the highway for more than \~2 hours, the error may **come back**, and it goes away again if I turn the engine off for some time.
3. The error sometimes shows up during **heavy rain** or after **driving through water**.
4. Occasionally, it can appear **randomly**, but that’s rare.

**Additional notes:**

* The error can be reset via **ELM** or **Jaguar IDS** software, but it **comes back after few seconds**.
* The **check engine light** doesn’t always illuminate when the error appears.
* If I reset the code with the engine **off**, it disappears — but comes back within seconds **after starting the engine**.
* The code **does not appear** with just ignition on — only after actual **engine start**.

**What has been done:**

1. Replaced the knock sensor with multiple original and compatible sensors (all tested — signal is correct);
2. Wiring from the knock sensor to the ECU was checked — everything is fine;
3. Fuel injectors cleaned;
4. Engine flushed with oil treatments multiple times (to remove deposits);
5. Brand new OEM alternator installed;
6. Engine mounts replaced with new OEM parts;
7. Tried running 95, 98, and 100 octane fuel — made no difference;
8. Engine ECU was re-flashed with the latest official firmware — no change;
9. Spark plugs replaced with correct new ones.

The engine itself runs **smooth and clean**. There are **no signs of knocking** or any other error codes.  
**Electrical systems are working fine**. Occasionally, in hot weather, I get a temporary ABS/DSC fault, but it disappears by itself and timing seems unrelated to the knock sensor erro

**Car details:**

**Car:** Jaguar S-Type 2003  
**Engine:** 3.0 V6 (AJ30)

I'm extremely grateful for any help, ideas, or advice you may have.  
This is literally the last remaining issue with the car — everything else is in great shape.  
I’ve already done so much trying to fix it that I’m out of ideas, and I’d really appreciate any suggestions.

Thank you!"

What is causing this noise?
So, my car just started making this noise today, and im wondering if anyone could identify a possible reason. It's a 2004 Ford Explorer, so pretty old, with ~110k miles. Attached a video with the noise coming from the suspected issue tire... Noticed after taking the video that the tire itself might be wiggling a bit, so might have something to do with it... Would appreciate any input, though."

Only OEM idle air control valves work for my car. Why even sell aftermarket parts for it? I had to return 6 already.
2006 Mitsubishi Lancer ES 2.0L  
  
Have any mechanic ever encountered a car that ONLY accepts OEM for a certain part and no matter what aftermarket parts you try they NEVER work?

With my car I have two mechanic fix it. 1 1/2 years ago the first mechanic tried 3 different aftermarket idle air control valves (2 from Import Direct which is an O'Reilly in house brand and 1 different brand) to fix a low idle issue I was having and all 3 did not work. What finally worked was an OEM Mitsubishi idle air control valve shipped from Japan. Then the gasket next to my idle air control valve failed so coolant got onto it and broke it after only 1 1/2 years. I brought it to another mechanic that tried 3 more aftermarket idle air control valves (2 from Standard Motor Products AC254 and 1 from a different brand) and again all 3 did not work. Finally I bought a used OEM Mitsubishi Evo 9 idle air control valve 1450A069 from eBay and it worked perfectly. Why are companies selling aftermarket idle air control valves that are compatible with my car, but they never work? Only OEM works. Why even sell it if people put it on and its not going to work so they have to send it back for a refund?"

Brake lights wont turn on
Hey, I have a 2015 Honda Civic SE and my brake lights stopped working right after I replaced the car battery. Since then, I’ve replaced the brake light switch twice (the brown one with the white plastic plunger), and I tested it by plugging it in and pressing the plunger manually — but still no brake lights. The switch clicks and seems to work mechanically, but the lights won’t turn on at all. I also found a random blue wire plugged into a fuse slot under the dash, which looks like a weird bypass from the previous owner. On top of that, the car has an aftermarket Bose audio system installed in the trunk, so I’m wondering if that might be interfering somehow with the wiring or fuse setup. I’m stuck trying to figure out if this is a fuse issue, wiring, or something electrical that got messed up when I swapped the battery. Any help or ideas would be appreciated."

They got me good. I was a dumbass and now I need a new transmission
Don’t be me. Don’t bring your vehicle into a shop you don’t know or trust without first taking photos and videos of every single corner of your car.

Recently my beater Honda Civic that I love too much was losing oil constantly. I did a visual inspection of the front of my engine and saw oil leaking down the front. It seemed like motor oil.

This was rather frustrating as I had taken it into a shop for a head gasket job, and it seemed as if the oil was coming from a place where it should have been covered by the head gasket job.

It was also rather frustrating because I had to take my car back to this same shop about four times because it was losing coolant. It was covered by warranty but my car was gone for a very long time.

So now since it’s still within warranty I decided to take it in, and they’ve been holding onto my car for nearly a month. Now I find out there’s a major transmission issue with fluid and shards of metal everywhere.

Damn, I did not check that area before leaving. I didn’t see any obvious shards of metal or transmission fluid, but I also didn’t get down there.

And besides, a visual check isn’t going to do anything in court, right? I would have needed photos and videos.

It was working just fine with no problems shifting or anything else to indicate transmission woes, and now it’s catastrophic. It doesn’t add up.

I know these crooks took a hammer and chisel or something to my transmission because they didn’t want to do any more free warranty work without something else to make up for it. But I can’t prove it.

So don’t be me. Take the photos and videos.

Any suggestions for next course of action are appreciated, thanks reddit.

Update: Looks like it might have been a misunderstanding. I’m choosing to leave this up since maybe it might help someone remember to get photos."

A/C Compressor Repair (Quoted $1,900)
Hello everyone, so as the title mentions, I am in need of what would be the best approach I should consider when it comes to an A/C repair. To make long story short, I have a 2021 Kia K5 (57,000 mileage) and unfortunately I currently have a shot A/C compressor which needs to be replaced. Unfortunately my warranty will not cover this issue at the dealership and I will need to pay out of pocket. The dealership quoted me at around $1,900 in total with parts & labor. As much as I need to get this fixed, would it be best to search for a second opinion? Or should I stick with the dealership?"

Ford transit AC and driver window help
got two issues that all happened within the past couple days. I have a 2018 Ford transit 250.   

My AC will only blow when it is on the highest setting. Doing a little research it looks like the likely cause is a blower motor resistor.  Looking at YouTube changing out this piece looks rather simple. I went to AutoZone and got the part, but I can’t for the life of me get the screw out of the one that’s still attached.  I went and bought a flexible screwdriver, but I still can't get it into the screw.  I don’t want to mess with it too much cause I don’t wanna strip it. Is there any other way I can get this out?  I spent over an hour just trying to use a flexible screwdriver and I couldn’t get it. What are my other options?

The other issue is my driver side window. I can’t get either side to roll up or down controlling the driver side window switches. I went to AutoZone and bought a new driver side window switch. This is a easy fix as well, but when I disconnected the old and put the new switch in, it still doesn’t work.  

I really would hate to take this to a mechanic and pay for the labor when the fix is pretty simple for both of these, or it should be .  Can anybody give me some suggestions on both of these issues?"

Got into a minor car accident
Today morning, I was trying to move to the left lane and accidentally scratched the car besides me. There's no major damage and no injuries from both parties. I was wondering, if I was getting my car scratches fixed should I register it under my car insurance or not? I heard that they would decrease the car value and the cost would triple if I ho with the insurance company and was suggested that just pay from my own pockets. If I don't register the da.age under the insurance company, will I be more vulnerable to legal issues if the other party claims for damages?

I'm sorry if nothing makes sense as this is my first time dealing with such issues.

2011 Hyundai Sonata key fob issue
We have an odd one here. Our key fob fails to be seen by the car. We replaced a couple of modules to try and fix the issue but it does not work. The odd part is that if we remove the battery power for like 30 minutes, plug it back in then it goes to working for a couple of days.

So a ""hard reset"" of sorts makes it work but then it later just stops seeing the key fob again. We had a new key fob made and programmed and it does not see it either. Any ideas besides taking a low value car to a dealer for a high repair bill? It's $175 to just hook it up to the shops computer. "

Troubleshooting Air-Fuel Ratio Issue
 I’m reaching out for some advice on a perplexing air-to-fuel ratio problem I’ve been experiencing with my vehicle. The trouble started while driving in third gear when I suddenly experienced a significant power loss, and the engine was running really poorly for about 20 seconds. Initially, the issue seemed to resolve itself, but it returned on my way home and unfortunately hasn’t cleared up since.

I have an air-fuel ratio gauge in my car that typically hovers around 14, but lately, I've noticed that it stays at 14 for a brief moment after starting, then shoots up to 19. From what I've gathered, a higher reading like 19 indicates that the engine is running lean, which concerns me.

Today, while investigating the issue, I came across the charcoal canister connected to the fuel tank, which leads back to the engine via a hose to a solenoid valve. Upon inspection, I found that the canister was filled with gasoline. I dried it out and reassembled everything, but the problem persists.

So, I’m looking for insights! Could this issue be linked to the solenoid valve, or might it have something to do with the fuel pump? Any recommendations or troubleshooting tips would be immensely appreciated! Thanks in advance for your help!"

Dealer replaced my ECM, is now saying there is a timing issue. I'm not so sure.
I have a 2016 Nissan NV3500 with the 5.6 liter V8.

The van has ~110k miles on it, but 9k miles ago, we had a Jasper rebuilt engine installed and replaced all of the plugs, put in a new water pump.  ~2k miles ago, I replaced all of the coils.

Three weeks ago, the van just died.  It had been running incredible since I replaced the coils - ultra smooth, getting better gas mileage.  Not using a drop of oil or water.


My wife had trouble cranking it, but it started.  She pulled out onto the road, but the gas pedal suddenly did nothing.  She coasted into a parking lot, and that was that.  No crank.

We did so much troubleshooting - fuel pump wasn't coming on.  We had power to the coils, but they wouldn't fire.  Spraying starter fluid into the intake did nothing, not even a hiccup.  For the first time ever, the van would not communicate with a code reader at all.

Checked all fuses five times - both physical inspection and used a tester to confirm circuit.  Replaced the crank position sensor.  No joy on any of it.  Process of elimination said bad ECM.

Took it to the dealer.  They said yes, bad ECM.  So $1900 later, we have a new ECM in place and programmed.  Code reader now communicates.

Now, the dealer says there is a timing issue, van still won't start.  They say the starter spins, the motor tries to turn over, won't run.  

I finally got them to send me a list of codes... and I'm dubious that this is mechanical.  I am wondering if they screwed up the reprogram.  The codes are:

P0075 - intake valve control solenoid (bank 1)  
P0081 - intake valve control solenoid (bank 2)  
P0113 - intake air temp sensor 1  
P0118 - engine coolant temp sensor  
P0123 - throttle position sensor  
P0223 - throttle position sensor  
P1564 - automatic speed control device (cruise control)  

I expected a bunch of cam/crank position codes.   But instead, I got this.  This, to me, sounds like it's all issues with electronics not communicating.  

Before I tow the van to another garage to have a mechanic do potential warranty work (obviously, Nissan isn't going to do warranty work for a Jasper engine), I'd love a sanity check from those who know what they are talking about.  To me, this doesn't add up.  


Thanks!

Need help diagnosing 2021 Corolla
Hello, I have a couple issues that I need help with.

I have a 2021 Corolla LE (default 1.8-liter 4-cylinder engine, if that matters) with 70k miles on it. It started shaking while driving a couple weeks ago and then it started making a slight grinding noise on Friday. So I replaced the front wheel bearings (and the brake pads because I saw they were going to need replacing soon when I got them off). When I did, the driver-side front bearing felt rough when I took it off, so I figured that was the issue. When I got done, the check engine light came on, along with the traction control, ABS, automatic emergency braking, and parking brake lights. I checked the OBDII codes figuring it was one of the ABS/wheel speed sensors, which it was. So I ordered sensors for both sides just to be safe and replaced the one on the passenger side because I figured that was the one I damaged and I was right. After getting the new sensor installed, I turned the car on. The check engine light was off, but the other lights were still on. I did a google search and tried everything I could find about resetting lights after replacing the wheel speed sensors, but they're still on. 

What should I do? Is it possible the other sense is bad too and it's not triggering the check engine light?



In addition to that, the shaking is not gone. It's better, and the grinding noise is gone, but it still shakes a bit while driving. It definitely increases/decreases in relation to the speed of the car, so I'm pretty sure it's something with the wheels. What should I check next? The tires seem OK, probably need new ones by the end of the year, but no deformations or anything like that. I was thinking about putting my full-size spare on each spot one at a time and driving it to see if the tires were the issue though.

Any recommendations for the shaking that I'm still experiencing?"

Sudden Power Loss and High Air/Fuel Ratio , 2017 Oreion Reeper
I'm having some trouble with my 2017 Oreion Reeper. While driving, I experienced a sudden power loss, and my air/fuel ratio gauge spiked to 19, whereas it normally ranges from 12 to 15. This lasted about 30 seconds, but after downshifting, it seemed to fix itself.

Later on, the problem came back and persisted, causing the car to shake and the engine to run poorly, with the air/fuel gauge remaining at 19. I have a tuner kit installed, and I even tried unplugging the control module to see if that would help, but no luck.

Does anyone have any ideas on what could be causing this issue? Where should I start looking? Thanks!

Report for 2020 Mercedes CLA 250 Coupe (engine size unknown)
I’m an idiot and let a corrupt auto shop drain me of my finances and give me my car back to me in worse condition. I wasn’t thinking clearly at the time but now realizing it was probably just the battery that needed charging, which I was alerted about and have done since. I was continuously harassed and paid ended up paying over 6k in addition to the 5k my insurance paid them. They took advantage of the fact that I was in the hospital and complained about having to deal with a third party on my behalf (my mom, who they harassed too). They had me pay for a ton of unauthorized services when I specifically stated multiple times that I didn’t want started until the adjuster provided an estimate and the amount they would cover, since I would’ve taken it to a shop they cover on the list they provided on the insurance site. I was also charged additional fees since the field inspector didn’t show up when he was supposed to and told about additional daily storage fees that would apply 30 minutes before it would take effect. I called the police for a civil standby which ended up useless since it’s a civil matter and pissed them off even further, resulting in even higher payments. At this point I’m too tired and don’t have the energy to fight this anymore. I only care if my car is safe to drive. Can anyone please advise if the airbag message indicates that it’s a faulty sensor or something mechanical? And if all the warning indicators are related to the same problem (as a car enthusiast friend had advised me)? I know I need to take it to the dealership now, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place since the preowned car dealership only gave me 1 set of keys that ended up breaking and I paid around $700 just for one new key fob at the dealership. I feel completely stupid and regretful for dragging my mom into this mess—lesson learned for next time. I don’t know much about cars and would appreciate any insight into this report. For reference, it’s a 2020 CLA 250 coupe that I bought this past new year and was completely torn apart, which is why I’m hoping it’s just faulty sensors/a simple electronics fix and wondering how much it would cost me. Thanks in advance."

Bruh…
A while back my 2011 Dodge Charger was hit close to the back left rear tire. I didn’t even realize this part was not attached at all until I went to get a tire change because they were balding fast. (Alignment issue) is this the upper or lower rearward control arm? If not what part is this and how much does it usually cost? Also any estimate on how much the work will cost to get it fixed?"

Renault 2014 Clio 4 “Check Engine” w/ Battery Error Codes
On my 2014 Renault Clio 4 I am getting the check engine text on the dash and wrench symbol and the following errors:

DF057 battery disconnection unit 

DF079 12V battery current sensor 

The car runs sort of fine but just has a wrench symbol, how do I fix these errors? The battery is fairly new, the sensor was cleaned and smoothed but no luck.

I’ve hard reset the ECU (then drove for 15 mins), checked the fuses and wiring, cleared and reset the codes.

Then I just took out the T diode which could be the cause of DF057 as that apparently is the the ““crash safety fuse” or pyrotechnic battery fuse, also known as a battery cut-off diode/fuse.” To see if that was faulty and causing the issue and ran the car but no luck."

Shops in NH that will slap an inspection stick on a crapbox?
Hey, chronic smitbox operator and fellow broke person here. 

  
 I know people in the community are generally protective over shops that are more lax with inspection stickers but here is hoping that someone can offer a direction. Essentially, my vehicle is super old and about a year off from being emissions-exempt. That's what's preventing it from passing currently. The local PD have been borderline harassing me about getting it done, and there have been two tickets issued this year. So over it. Does anybody know where I might be able to get a sticker with that engine light on? Even a quick PM with a suggestion would be huge. 

  
 Thank you in advance!



 Edit: The emissions is coming from a small leak somewhere. Mechanics can't locate the source, and all the usual culprits have been replaced. No luck. Did attempt to restart the system by disconnecting the battery - which worked for 100 miles or so and was told that the systems mechanics use during inspections would be able to detect the leak with the code cleared, anyway."

BMW e36 320i 2L window repair
Hi all!

Sorry if this isn't the right place, I'll also look for other subreddits.

I've got this issue, pictured, with the rear window of my car. The old window is coming away and the problem is getting worse. 

My plan to repair is thus:
1. Remove old window
2. get a plastic sheet, acetate or something, and impact cement it onto the rim where the old one was glued down
3. Cut it to size with a sharp implement. 

What do we think realistically of this plan? Any better suggestions?

Thanks!"

Aftermarket headunit won't turn off when car is turned off and steering wheel controls don't work.
Hello people of Reddit! I recently bought a cheap headunit from aliexpress, and I'm trying to fit it into the car. It works surprisingly well, tho I have an issue with it, which is that it's always powered on. Doesn't matter if the car is running or not, it's always turned on draining my battery. And also the steering wheel controls don't work. The HU came with a CAN decoder, but with me going into the settings and changing it's firmware I'm still getting the same error. On the description of the product it also said that there's a little plastic connector between 2 cables, and disconnecting those will make it shut down like intended, but instead it doesn't even power on with those disconnected.

  
I have no clue what the issue might be, I even tried swapping the red and yellow cables on the adapter, but that didn't make a difference. I attached a picture of the cars default quadlock connector, could the problem be that it has a blue section that the adapter isn't plugging into?

2020 trail-boss 153k miles

When at a steady speed or in cruise control i feel a jerk or what you would say (slipping). I notice my rmps fluctuating from 1 to 1.5 and if im going at higher speeds while on cruise control it will go from 1.5 to 2 and jerk every 10-20 seconds.

(This is my first time having vehicle issues and i know nothing so I’m here for any suggestions)

There’s no noises, nothing happens when in park, everything sounds fine.

I took it to a shop today and they drove it around the block and said i needed a whole new transmission. They didn’t look at anything or really even say it could be anything else. The second shop i took it to gave me 10 different things it could be other than getting a whole new transmission. This shop will run a diagnostic test tomorrow & over the weekend to pinpoint the issue.

Just to financially prepare myself and educate myself does anyone have any ideas what it could be or what i should look for under the hood to see if i can see anything out of place that could help causing this.

Thanks! (Young thriving (somewhat spiraling) adult"

Slight noise with newly replaced windshield
2009 dodge Calibre

Just got the windshield on my parents car replaced today and it looks fantastic, but there's a slight cracking or creaking or grinding sound whenever we go over uneven road at higher speeds (especially on the highway). The noise doesn't bother me but I'm concerned if the windshield is structurally sound. I waited a full hour and a half to drive after installation as per the installer's instructions so I am hoping its not an issue with the adhesive. 

Is this a structural risk or just a minor annoyance. My folks can't hear it because they're old so it doesn't matter if it doesn't pose any risk since they're going to be the one's driving it. Just want to make sure its not going to slide off while they're driving or something. "

2017 Subaru Forester possible AC clog/link

- Intermittent buzzing/light rattling noise coming from the passenger dashboard 
- Water leaking from under passenger side dashboard

Asking for more advice
Hello Reddit,

About a week ago I had posted about my wife's car, a **2012 Ford Fusion 3.0v6 with \~160k mile**s, it was clicking but not turning over.  We tested the battery with a battery tester after several attempts to jump start it and the battery was just 100% dead, but held a charge when recharged and both the battery and alternator tested good before we decided it was okay to drive.  About 5 miles into her first drive out after having these problems, it died at a light.  Then again about a mile later while slowing down towards another light.  She turned around and headed home, and it died 3 more times on the way back:  a stop sign, when slowing to turn on a road towards our house, and after shifting from drive to reverse to get in the driveway.

Is this likely a short somewhere in the ignition system or somewhere else?  What besides a short could be causing problems like this?  

Thanks for any advice."

AAMCO Technicians STUMPED (And I'm out $1,500)
Hi all — hoping someone here can shed some light on this. My 2016 Ford Mustang EcoBoost is throwing a persistent **P0717 code** (Input/Turbine Speed Sensor “A” No Signal), and even after **replacing the sensor**, the issue came back almost immediately. AAMCO has now had the car for two more full days and can’t identify what’s still wrong. I’m stuck without a car and would hugely appreciate any insights from this community.

**Vehicle:**

* 2016 Ford Mustang EcoBoost
* 4-cylinder, 2.3L turbocharged
* Automatic transmission (6R80)

**Background & What’s Been Done:**

* My usual mechanic pulled the **P0717 code** and confirmed that the speed sensor in this car is located inside the transmission, integrated into the **lead frame (conductor plate)**.
* They referred me to AAMCO, who:
   * Removed the transmission pan
   * Found clean fluid and no debris
   * Replaced the **OEM conductor plate / lead frame** (includes the input speed sensor)
   * **Reinstalled the Transmission Control Module (TCM)** as part of reassembly
   * Topped off fluid and filter
   * Charged \~$1,500 for the work
* As soon as I left the lot, the car **lurched into gear**, threw the **same wrench light**, and repeated the original issue.

# Current Symptoms:

**Acceleration**

* When I step on the gas, the engine will sometimes rev with **no acceleration**.
* The car will then suddenly **lurch into gear**, sometimes causing the wheels to chirp.
* These events are almost always followed by the **wrench light**.
* When coasting, the car doesn’t decelerate naturally.
* This behavior happens **most often after the car sits for a few hours** (cold start).
* Also — we’ve been having **very hot weather** lately, in case that matters.

**A/C Fan Fluctuation**

* For several months before the P0717 showed up, the **A/C blower fan would randomly surge or dip in speed** without touching controls.

**iPhone Overheating Warning**

* Once, while charging my iPhone in the car, I received a **“temperature warning”** on the phone.
* Could be unrelated, but it’s never happened in that position in my car before.

**Diagnostic Procedures Reported (per AAMCO):**

* **Transmission fluid:** Clean, full, no odor or debris
* **Input speed sensor resistance:** Tested out of spec (justified replacement)
* **Alternator:** Reportedly tested under load and at startup — “checked out”
* **Test drives:** They’ve driven the car multiple times but **cannot replicate the issue**
* **TCM:** Physically reinstalled during reassembly, but unclear whether any adaptive reset or relearning was performed

Meanwhile, **every time I drive it**, the problem returns within minutes.

**Other Notes:**

* I installed a **new battery about a year ago**. The install seemed fine, and the car has run well since — but I mention it in case a loose connection or grounding issue is affecting voltage delivery.

**My Theory (as a non-expert):**

While I know the input speed sensor was replaced, I keep thinking this is **electrical**:

* Maybe the **alternator is intermittently faulting**, and it just hasn’t happened while under test?
* Maybe it’s a **wiring or connector issue** — something degrading signal to the TCM or sensor intermittently?
* I wonder if the **TCM wasn’t reset or adapted** after installing the new lead frame?

It feels like AAMCO isn’t super eager to keep chasing it down since they’ve already done the repair and been paid. So I’m here, hoping someone has seen this before.

Any thoughts or next steps I could suggest to the shop?

Thanks in advance!"

P1b25 High Voltage Battery Path Fault
It was about time I needed a new 12v battery on my 2015 Kia Optima Hybrid Ex so I went ahead and replaced it. Was driving around the very same day and about 5 hours later the acceleration to the car cut off and I could no longer drive the vehicle; luckily I was around the corner from my home. 

This is when EVERYTHING started happening. 
once I pulled over and turned vehicle off. Lights would come onto the dash but the vehicle wouldn’t flip over to “ready” and I was getting hybrid warning messages to turn off vehicle to prevent hybrid damage. That very same evening the same 12V I had just bought that same day was already drained dead. I was under assumption I would need to change Hybrid Battery. 

Fast forward a few months since then. Had my mechanic run some codes. He pulled 1 code which was p1b25. And here I am; I did extensive digging and realized it could be the High Voltage Fuse so I ordered the new part and put it in( I got entire housing not just the fuse and replaced the High Voltage Fuse Orange housing as well) ; and the vehicle was flipping over to ready while I had the dead battery on jumper cables. 

I went down the rabbit hole of getting a new 12v battery to see if the battery being fully juiced would help the gas powered engine kick on. Got nothing. 

Now after switching both High Voltage Fuse and 12V battery; vehicle doesn’t send me any hybrid warnings anymore. Instead; Now I’m receiving “check charging system” warnings and “stop vehicle to charge battery” when the car won’t even go anywhere (lol) and the engine still won’t turn on. Vehicle still wont accelerate. 

What should my next steps be? I’ve seen some people say that the p1b25 code either means 12v battery; the fuse; or the power relay. The only two things I haven’t fixed is the power relay nor the hybrid battery itself

Just don’t want to continue down a rabbit hole if I need to fix the hybrid battery. I’ve also seen some posts of people saying they fixed their hybrid battery and it still didn’t resolve these similar issues. 

Any advice with similar circumstances and what fixed the problem for you would be greatly appreciated and of tremendous help!

Need advice/thoughts/feedback on repairs for 1998 Lexus ES and 2008 Avalon XLS
Hi, I am very frustrated with my car repair situation. We have a 1998 Lexus ES and a 2008 Avalon. The Lexus has 112,049 miles on it, and the Avalon has 72,096 miles. I am single, live in Florida and I  work from home. My mother currently lives with me and is disabled and not in good health. We get along well, and have a good amount of separate, independent living space and individual privacy, however she is disabled and cannot walk or get out of her bed without my help. We live a quiet life and have almost everything delivered (Instacart for all groceries, and Amazon and Walmart deliveries for most everything else). Currently, I just drive for nearby errands such as pharmacy, bank, post office, and medical appointments as I try not to be gone for long periods of time being concerned  my mother might need my help. Several years ago I put the cars on battery tender, and a few years ago I moved them out of the garage to make space to store some items, but am easy to clear out the garage again and get the cars back in. Initially, it seemed the alternator went bad on the Lexus, as I could only get it to start with a battery jump device , but it would quickly go off. I then began using only the Avalon before the same thing occurred. I ordered new alternators from Amazon for both cars and also had Walmart deliver new batteries for both cars. Since my father passed and I took over care of the cars, I would initially take them to Sears Auto Shop (when they were still in business), as this is where my father had taken them. I grew frustrated whenever one of the cars needed a part, all they said they could get me was a “refurbished” part. After getting my own new parts, I was going to try a service where a mechanic comes to your home and repairs your cars. They said on the website that you could have your own new parts installed, an just pay labor, but if that part didn’t function properly you would then also have to pay for them to get a replacement part and additional labor to install. They also said that if you did have your own parts installed there would be no warranty on the part or labor. I thought this was fair (after all, garages were offering me “refurbished” parts and only a one year part and labor warranty). I felt it was worth a try. However, scheduling two cars for the mechanic that comes to your home was complicated, so I decided to use mu USAA Roadside Assistance to have the cars towed to our local Toyota dealer’s garage. Initially, the service manager told me they have a strict policy against using outside parts. I voiced my concern with only being offered “refurbished parts” in the past and told him that the new parts were already in two bags in the front passenger seats of each car, along with a detailed letter of what I experienced with the cars and believe the issues to be, and printouts from the Amazon website about each parts, and showing that they were “appropriate fits” for the cars. However, I told him I respect their policy and that he could just ignore the parts. I fid tell him that the Lexus was missing front hood Struts, and that I had a new pair in the bag of new parts.
He later texted me and said he would make exceptions for some of the parts – bur definitely not the alternator. He said they needed the front struts and a battery installed on the Lexus to test the alternator and could use my parts and charge $50 labor for the strut install and $26 labor for battery install. He also said that the Avalon needed a new battery, and that they could also use the new one I had sent in with the car (just pay an additional $26 labor for the install), I also approved that, as well. 
He said the alternator was bad on the Lexus, as well as many other things that I wasn’t expecting. He said the Lexus also needs brakes and tires are pretty bad -  cracked and almost flat, brake rotors very rusty. None of this was apparent to me before I had the car towed in for service.
This was the results/recommendations of the Lexus test:
Alternator Replacement: ALTERNATOR FAILED LOAD TEST, REPLACEMENT REQUIRED (QUOTED AFTERMARKET ALTERNAOTOR, NEEDS TO BE ORDERED) (WILL INSTALL CUSTOMERS OWN SUPPLIED DRIVE BELT WITH ALTERNATOR REPLACEMENT)
$650.99
Tires- 4: REPLACE 4 TIRES- ALL TIRES ARE DRYROTTING QUOTED GENERAL RELIATREK 205/65/15 (NOT IN STOCK NEED TO BE ORDERED)

Brake Job – Front (Replace Pads and Rotors): FRONT BRAKE PADS VERY LOW, ROTORS VERY RUSTY, AND THERE IS A RISK OF CALIPERS SEIZING UP DURING REMOVAL DUE TO VEHCLE HAVING BEEN SITTING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. IF CALIPERS SEIZE DURING REMOVAL, REPLACEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED AT ADDITIONAL COST 
$522.79
Brake Job – Rear (Replace Pads and Rotors): REAR BRAKE PADS VERY LOW, ROTORS VERY RUSTY, AND THERE IS A RISK OF CALIPERS SEIZING UP DURING REMOVAL DUE TO VEHCLE HAVING BEEN SITTING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. IF CALIPERS SEIZE DURING REMOVAL, REPLACEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED AT ADDITIONAL COST
$552.79
*Coolant Flush: PREMIUM COOLING SYSTEM FLUID EXCHANGE (RK222) “SEQUOIA AND TUNDRA MODELS REQUIRE ADDITIONAL FLUID AT ADDITIONAL COST”
$169.95
*** TOTAL COST (if all recommended services are preformed:)  $2,652.20
Regarding the Avalon 
The Service Manager said that the alternator on the Avalon is working, but the 2 front tires are flat and rotors rusted from sitting. When cars sit for long periods of time, things wear out and go bad just from sitting. Then he cautioned me to keep in mind that it is hard to predict if something will go wrong as a consequence of sitting for a long time, and then start driving it again. So this is what we visibly see and suggest, but have not test driven the car as yet.
He then presented me with the results and recommendations of the Avalon test:
*He said that there wee two options for installing new tires.  Option number one (having two front tires replaced) or option number two (having all four tires replaced) – which they would recommend
I compiled two separate “total charges” at the end of the report. One for going with option number one (only two front tires replaced, and a second for going with option number two (having all four tires replaced).
Below are the test results/recommendations for the Avalon:
Tires – 2: FRONT 2 TIRES ARE FLAT AND DRY ROTTING ON ARRIVAL, NEED TO REPLACE AT LEAST FRONT 2 TIRES QUOTED GENERAL RELIATREK 215/55/17
$420.14
Tires- 4: ALL 4 TIRES ARE DRY ROTTING AND SHOULD BE REPLACED, TIRES WITH DRY ROT CRACKS THAT HAVE BEEN SITTING FOR YEARS ARE A BLOW OUT RISK WHEN DRIVING. QUOTED GENERAL RELIATREK 215/55/17
$552.07
*Alignment: WHEEL ALIGNMENT WHEN NEW TIRES INSTALLED
$149.95
Brake Job – Front (Replace Pads and Rotors): FRONT BRAKE PADS VERY LOW, ROTORS VERY RUSTY, AND THERE IS A RISK OF CALIPERS SEIZING UP DURING REMOVAL DUE TO VEHCLE HAVING BEEN SITTING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. IF CALIPERS SEIZE DURING REMOVAL, REPLACEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED AT ADDITIONAL COST  $535.39 Brake Job – Rear (Replace Pads and Rotors): REAR BRAKE PADS VERY LOW, ROTORS VERY RUSTY, AND THERE IS A RISK OF CALIPERS SEIZING UP DURING REMOVAL DUE TO VEHCLE HAVING BEEN SITTING FOR A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. IF CALIPERS SEIZE DURING REMOVAL, REPLACEMENT WILL BE REQUIRED AT ADDITIONAL COST  $552.07 *** TOTAL COST [Option #1 – 2 front tires replaced] (if all recommended services are preformed): $1,657.55 *** TOTAL COST [Option #2 – all 4 tires replaced] (if all recommended services are preformed): $1,749.48 
I remembered that we had both cars to that dealership for service a few years ago, and I told him that I hadn’t done a good job of keeping any “maintenance logs”, so I asked him to check the computer to see what we had done. It turns out it was in 2019 and at that time the Lexus got an oil change , as well as both front and rear brake jobs and the Avalon got an oil change as well as well as the lug nuts replaced, the passenger side cv axel, the brake and transmission fluids were both flushed, and the air and cannot filter were replaced. The Lexus has been our leas used car (it had111, 487 miles when it was last serviced in 2019, and at that time had a font and back break replacement. Currently, it has 112,049, meaning it gained only 562 miles in 6 years. It is difficult for me  understand how it would need new front and rear brakes again, yeats later and accruing only 562 additional miles, albeit it was sitting in my driveway (uncovered) the remainder of those six years in Florida weather. As for the Avalon (the more heavily used car of the two), in 2019 when I was last in for service, it had 64,052 miles on it, and now it has 72,096 miles, which amounts to an 8,0404 mileage increase over the past six years. According to Google, “Brake Pads: Expect to replace brake pads every 25,000 to 65,000 miles” and “Brake Rotors: Rotors typically last between 30,000 and 70,000 miles.”
The Service Manager also clarified onto the issues of calipers and beak pads/rotors. He said that when they begin to replace the break pads, the calipers may lock up when the try to compress them, and if that were to happen, they would also need to replace the broken calipers to complete the break job. He said that the risk was there hat this could happen with both cars having been sitting for so long (Which seems counterintuitive to me, as I always assumed with mechanical parts, the more you use them, the more problems or could be, and the less they are used, the fewer problems there could be.)
I asked what “wost case scenario” would cost if all of the calipers needed to also be replaced (on both cars). He estimates it could be $100 per caliper (×4) = an extra $400  (pet car) and $200 (x2) per axel for labor, which could be ab extra $400 per car. Worst case scenario would then be an additional $1,600 for both cars.
I also asked him about the tire alignment (why it was quoted on the Avalon, but nit the Lexus, when tire replacements were recommended on both vehicles).  He said whenever they install new tires, they recommend it, and said that he thought it was quoted for both vehicles.
Additionally, he said that a “break flush” should have also been recommended on the Avalon, as it was for the Lexus, because both cars had been sitting for a long time and that brake fluid is a “hydroscopic fluid”, and moisture reduces its efficacy.
Yesterday, when I expressed feeling a bit “overwhelmed”, when all I thought I was brining my car into the shop for was two battery installs, two alternator installs (turns out the Avalon didn’t even need a new alternator, just a new battery), and then got a report back of extensive tire and battery replacement issues. 
He said if I didn’t want to do everything at once, I could postpone the break jobs on the Lexus, but it might squeal, make noise and possibly feel pulsating when breaking; however the last time  drove it I experienced none if that. 
He said that the “dry rot” on the tires were more concerning from a safety standpoint; but again there was no “dry rot” or “flat tires” visible to me (on either vehicle) before they were towed to the shop.
He said that the Avalon front and rear break pads are very low at 3mm (1/8 inch), and again was focused on “dry rot” on tires, flat tires and “low on tread”.
The Service Manager also confirmed that all parts use for repairs would be “refurbished”, and come with one year parts (at least for the parts that they supplied) and labor – which I suppose is standard for the industry.
I would greatly appreciate any thoughts, comments, advice, recommendations, personal experiences, as well as “hacks” or workarounds (different ideas of doing things) that anyone has to offer. Your comments would be greatly appreciated. Thanks."

Praise for Auto Repair Shop
I recently created a post, just now in fact, questioning whether I was being charged unfairly, but I wanted to praise another shop “from 100 years ago.”

I took a Chevy Nova — no idea what year, I’m not a car guy, but I was a teenager and I’m 62 years old now — into a shop to have repairs done. 

They completed the work and I drove away happy.

Weeks later I had what I considered a different problem, took it back to the same shop to have it looked at.

One of the representatives there came back out with a check for $300 and said that they determined they couldn’t repair my car, and connected their inability to that prior work they’d completed (to my way of thinking) satisfactorily.

They refunded my money for the previous work and directed me to a dealership to have the work done. 

This is something I’ve never heard of happening. 

In fact, more times than not, what you see are stories of clueless people getting ripped off by dealerships or mechanics for their (insert strange Dr. Seuss imaginary auto part word here) needing repaired or some nonexistent mechanical issue that they just made up on the fly. "

Check engine light fee?
I have a 2009 Honda CRV that I’ve taken to a local shop repeatedly and it seems that every time I go there they charge me $160 to interpret the check engine code to diagnose my vehicle’s problem. 

Months ago, they read the code, charged me $160, told me it was for potential catalytic converter failure. 

I declined the service, but went back weeks later to have the service done after the situation became worse.

They charged me an additional 160 to read the code *again* prior to replacing the catalytic converter.

A friend said “you can get that done for free at XYZ shop.” Fast-forward another few weeks and I get the check engine light code read at XYZ shop for free. 

I took the XYZ shop printout back to the shop in question and they charged me again to read the check engine light code!

Left the shop with a $400 charge and a car that is in working order yet wondering why I was charged $160 to read a check engine light code that I already had had read for free. 

Note: Somewhere in the timeline described above I did ask the shop owner about the second charge of $160 to have the code read regarding the catalytic converter, that I saw it as a double charge in the space of a week or two for the same check engine light and he replied that he’d give me a free oil change in return. 

The shop does satisfactory work and they offer a free loaner car while the work is being done, however what I see as an unnecessary fee does make me question whether it’s a reasonable charge for that service."

Report for 2020 Mercedes CLA 250 Coupe (engine size unknown)
I’m an idiot and let a corrupt auto shop drain me of my finances and give me my car back to me in worse condition. I wasn’t thinking clearly at the time but now realizing it was probably just the battery that needed charging, which I was alerted about and have done since. I was continuously harassed and paid ended up paying over 6k in addition to the 5k my insurance paid them. They took advantage of the fact that I was in the hospital and complained about having to deal with a third party on my behalf (my mom, who they harassed too). They had me pay for a ton of unauthorized services when I specifically stated multiple times that I didn’t want started until the adjuster provided an estimate and the amount they would cover, since I would’ve taken it to a shop they cover on the list they provided on the insurance site. I was also charged additional fees since the field inspector didn’t show up when he was supposed to and told about additional daily storage fees that would apply 30 minutes before it would take effect. I called the police for a civil standby which ended up useless since it’s a civil matter and pissed them off even further, resulting in even higher payments. At this point I’m too tired and don’t have the energy to fight this anymore. I only care if my car is safe to drive. Can anyone please advise if the airbag message indicates that it’s a faulty sensor or something mechanical? And if all the warning indicators are related to the same problem (as a car enthusiast friend had advised me)? I know I need to take it to the dealership now, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place since the preowned car dealership only gave me 1 set of keys that ended up breaking and I paid around $700 just for one new key fob at the dealership. I feel completely stupid and regretful for dragging my mom into this mess—lesson learned for next time. I don’t know much about cars and would appreciate any insight into this report. For reference, it’s a 2020 CLA 250 coupe that I bought this past new year and was completely torn apart, which is why I’m hoping it’s just faulty sensors/a simple electronics fix and wondering how much it would cost me. Thanks in advance."

Please help. So many issues at once
2013 Mazda CX-5 Touring 2.0

My initial problem happened when driving, out of the blue, by dash lit up like a 🎄 with warning lights. Basically no power when accelerating, misfiring engine, car jolting etc. Got it home and ran a OBDII diagnostic and got P0300 (random, multiple cylinder misfire) and P0421 (warm up catalyst below threshold,bank 1). The 2nd code I have actually gotten for the past few years every winter but car ran fine and code would always go away when it was warm outside. I just passed inspection a couple months ago so I dont think my cat is shot. The 1st code I read has the symptoms I was having and I replaced all my spark plugs and even ignition coils. I couldn't tell which cylinder was bad and multimeter wasn't narrowing it down for me so I replaced them all. Started my car and that wasnt the issue. Now it is shaking and stuttering when I start engine and entire yard stunk like sulfur. Now I'm thinking maybe my cat is shot. However, during all of this I had another code pop up, P0571 (brake switch A circuit) which I read is a faulty brake light switch. Replaced that. Now I wanted to see if any codes went away or more are there but now I can't get my car to start. It cranks but won't start and I've noticed my battery is always dead even after charging it. Now I'm seeing a ton more issues that seem to have come out of nowhere. Not only will my car not start with a full good battery, my key fob is not recognized. I know this bc there's a flashing red security light on dash that doesn't go away when I get in car and that is the reason it won't start apparently. On top of that, my gps light and 12v sockets in car stay powered even when car is off so I've been having to disconnect my battery every night. Replaced battery in fob also. And lastly, you are supposed to have to press on brake to start car, but it will try to start even without the brake needing to be pressed. So to sum it all up, battery keeps dying bc car isn't going to sleep, Gps light and 12v sockets stay on unless I disconnect battery, car doesn't recognize my key fob and therefore I can't start car, when I could start car I get a faulty brake switch code but changed it, very bad stuttering with no power,  random misfire code but changed spark plugs and coils, and below threshold bank 1 cat code that I've had for years but no issues until now, sulfur smell when engine runs. Sorry for the novel but trying to give all info in case it makes more sense as what the issues are. Thanks guys🙏

TL/DR -battery keeps dying bc car isn't going to sleep, Gps light and 12v sockets stay on unless I disconnect battery, car doesn't recognize my key fob and therefore I can't start car, when I could start car I get a faulty brake switch code but changed it, very bad stuttering with no power, random misfire code but changed spark plugs and coils, and below threshold bank 1 cat code that I've had for years but no issues until now, sulfur smell when engine runs"

Advice on what to inspect for inactive car
If I have a barely-used SUV that hasn't been touched for several years, what general areas should I inspect before I try to start it up again?

Some notes about the vehicle I came up with:

* Good condition with no problems prior
* Might still have several-years-old gas in the tank
* Guessing the battery needs charging
* Not sure about engine oil or anything else located under the front hood
* Definitely need to re-pump tires, but will probably need to start the car so I can use the pump

Is there anything I'm missing? Any help is appreciated, thanks."

Help with water pump on 2018 Chevy Silverado.
2018 Chevy Silverado 1500 LT  140,000 miles
I'm reaching out to see if anyone has dealt with this same situation—or has a lead on a solution.

I own a 2018 Chevy Silverado 1500 LT with the E-Assist package (mild hybrid), and I'm facing a serious problem: the water pump for this specific model is no longer made.

I have a liaison with General Motors who confirmed that GM discontinued manufacturing this specific water pump in 2023, and there is currently no replacement part being produced.

Here’s what I’ve tried so far:

Sent the original pump to a water pump company in Paso Robles, California, but they said they could not rebuild it.

Took it to a rebuilder here in Fort Worth, and he also said it wasn’t rebuildable.

Hired a parts locator to try and find a replacement—he did the search and ended up not charging me because he couldn’t locate one anywhere.

The truck has been in the shop since September.

Back in January, someone suggested trying to grind down a couple of ribs and fit the old pulley onto a standard water pump as a workaround, but that’s not ideal and doesn’t seem reliable long-term.

I’ve also tried LKQ and Summit Racing—neither has the part or a workable alternative.

AC Help
2006 4runner v6. I'm trying to figure out what my AC problem could be. All of sudden my AC light was flashing which was indicating the compressor was not engaging. I switched out the relay to a new one and it was working fine and the air was blowing cold until the next day where it started flashing again, and the compressor was not engaging again.

I read that this could be due to low charge. So, I grabbed one of those AC pro kits (I know people are not a fan of these, but I'm ballin on a budget), and saw that the pressure was very low. So, I recharged the system to around 40PSI, and now my AC works for about 5 minutes. The compressor will kick on for about a second or two, and then shut off, and then kicks back on for another second. it just cycles like that over and over until eventually it just stops kicking in.

Is this a sign of a bad compressor? Is there another part of the AC system that could be faulty? I'm no expert when it comes to AC systems. So, any advice at all would be greatly appreciated."

Car needs to be frequently jumped
Okay so my base knowledge about cars is practically nothing. My car has had to be jumped probably about 4 times this week already. I have no clue what’s going on with it. I’ve been trying to charge it today and it charged like ten percent and then said “battery failure” and then I’m trying to charge it again now. 

Some things to note after the googling I’ve done:
- I cleaned the corrosion off my positive terminal today
- my battery was replaced a month or two ago
- my alternator was replaced in October

From the reading I’ve been doing I think I most likely have a parasitic drain. The problem happens after it’s been sitting all night, not during a long drive. Is there anything I can do even as a band aid fix for this until I can take it into the shop? I’m having some serious financial issues right now and know I don’t have the money to get it fixed. So if there’s anything I can do to limp it along for the next month or so I need to do it asap. "

Does Bureau of Auto Repair require warranty on work done?
Hi.  Based in USA, Northern California....My engine light came on (Suburu WRX 2015, 47K miles per recently installed JDM engine).

UPDATED today 3.7.25 with invoices. To be fair to the shop, erased all identifying info:

1. Invoice #1 (when I originally brought the car into this shop) and
2. Invoice #2 (when engine light came on just after repair #1).  I see now that they didn't put the codes on the invoices (Question: do many mechanics include the codes on diagnostic reports/invoices given to customer?)

SUMMARY of PROBLEM: Auto Shop XYZ charged for a diagnosis, found a code, and gave estimate of $1400+.  They fixed the issue and released my car (as fixed); I paid the bill.

The very next day (after repair), the engine light came on. They took my car back - charged me again for a diagnosis which 'turned up a new code' - they charged me $450 to fix it. I paid it.

Yesterday, they released the car (as fixed). Total paid so far $1850.

Today: Engine light is on again: 3rd time. Doesn't seem fair that I should've had to pay for the second 'diagnosis' and repair, given that they obviously missed something in the first diagnosis/repair - or didn't test it thoroughly enough post-repair to trigger the light. But even more, it seems they should now do all diagnosis/repairs until the engine light is off for good (and stays off for a month or so).

Questions:

1. Does Bureau of Auto Repair require a minimum warranty period for work done on used cars - even if the shop doesn't mention a warranty on their invoice (which they didn't)?
2. For you auto shop owners, would you make good on it without charging me again?  I'm fair to auto shop owners; I want fairness both ways.

Exhausted.

Thanks.

Radio playing static and Phone won’t charge.
Hi everyone,

I just got my yearly maintenance at the Honda dealership done on my 2020 Honda Civic.

However, now my radio has a loud static sound. And it won’t go away no matter what station I’m on and no matter what location I’m in.

Also now when I plug my phone into the outlet (the one that’s under the infotainment system) the phone won’t charge at all.

Did the mechanic mess with something when he was doing my maintenance on my car?

How do I fix this? 

The radio problem doesn’t matter too much.

But I really need to be able to charge my phone  in my car because I go on long drives and use my GPS for it.

What should I do?"

I just lost my livelihood. Did they ruin my car?
I felt a thump under my drivers side sometimes when I turned left. I brought my 2010 Toyota Rav4 into my mechanics for an oil change and mentioned the issue.

They then did an inspection for diagnosis and told me I needed new brakes. They charged me 900 for two front brakes and the oil change. I already feel like an idiot for paying that. 

The next day I drive it fine. Although the thump is still there.

The next day I get up to go to work and I notice the oil pressure light is on. I immediately turn the car off and check the oil. The oil seems fine. It's weird it seems low on one side of the stick and fine on the other. 

I start the car again and the oil light flashes once and then turns off. I let the car run and hear no problems. Oil light doesn't come back on. I figure it's just really cold (20 degrees) and it's a fluke.

I take it for a test drive literally down the street. The engine starts making a very loud rumbling noise. The car drives fine. No lurching or anything, just the loud noise. I immediately turn around and go home.

I call my dad. My dad starts it and takes a look under the hood. He uses the code reader and a code p0222 comes up.

We take it back to the original mechanic and tell him that not only is the original problem not fixed but we have a new one.

We wait 24 hours he tells us that it's the oil pump and wants to charge us $4300 dollars. He says even if they fix it, the engine is probably ruined. We ask why he couldn't see this problem when he did the inspection. He said there was no way to see it without taking everything apart.

I am poor and cannot afford that. I use my car for my business. I think they ruined my car when they did the oil change. What are the odds that I get my oil changed and this happens 2 days after? I know there's nothing i can do if they did. I can't afford a lawyer. I should note that we usually deal with the namesake of the garage, an older man. It seems like his young son has taken over.

I want to believe they're telling the truth. I think I could mourn my car easier that way, but could this really be a coincidence? What are the odds they're telling the truth?

Any help would be appreciated. I am absolutely devastated. I took meticulous care of this car. Never missed or was late for an oil change or scheduled maintenance. Replaced what needed to be replaced when it came up. I just spent 900 dollars on a junk car. I'm literally just sat here crying in the dark. I don't know what I'm going to do."

Update : second opinion please
Original post above.

So I ended up taking my car to my trusted mechanic.  He verified that the rear main seal needed replaced. Additionally after looking everything over he found the Exhaust manifold had a crack in it. He quoted me less than 2k to fix everything.  I jumped on it since dealership was charging me 4k just for rear main seal, new bolts, new seals for various locations like fuel pump seal and some other seals that didn't need replacement. 

So I went to pick up my Terrain today and the mechanic came out to tall to me. He pulled out a zip lock bag that had a dirty and compressed oil filter in it. He looked at me and asked ""when is the last time you got your oil changed?"" I told him 20 days ago at the dealership. He said well me and the owner think they didn't replace the oil filter. After 20 days the oil filter shouldn't be this compacted and dark colored. It should still be slightly tan colored. So either they didn't replace the oil filter like they said or they didn't replace your oil and left the old oil because when he tool the car apart the oil was very dark and sludge. He said new oil shouldn't be so dark. 

Well I recall the dealership when they were diagnosing my rear main seal told me the car had bled oil and only had 1 quart left when they got it. They asked permission to add 4 quarts so they can see where the leak was from. Remember I had new oil and filter supposedly from them 20 days ago. So when my mechanic got the car and started looking into it I asked why was the oil dark and sludgy and oil filter look like it was not changed when I had dealership change oil 20 days ago? He said it could be that the tech didn't properly torgue the filter and overtightened it which is why it is compressed, or he didn't replace the old oil filter. Or it could be that they didn't changed the oil at all when they said they did.

I know dealerships are expensive but I really only go to them for routine maintenance like oil changes because they do the multipoint inspection, look everything over and do free tire rotation. Now I kinda don't want to take my vehicle to them anymore for anything because I can't trust them now even if they are supposed to be trained on my specific model vehicle. 

Thoughts?

I just find it strange that if that is the case could dirty oil and filter that didn't get changed cause some sort of issue that contributed to my initial problem? 

I am never taking my car back to dealer.

URGENT! Removed battery, charged it full, reinstalled, NO CHARGING!
2014 Toyota Auris. It began because I noticed it was only half full, although possibly 'normal' in winter short-distance driving. Anyway, I removed the battery (original Toyota, replaced few months ago) and hooked it on a microprocessor charger until it was reported and looked full (dropping to 12.9x volts heading for ~12.8 volts), kept refresh charge for a couple more hours.

Then I reinstalled it. There was a brief sparking on the negative terminal on connecting - is that normal that it initially draws enough to cause that?

I started the car, one mistry because it had to learn stuff again so the engine wasn't as responsive as usual, so another crank did it.

Well, suddenly the alternator doesn't charge anymore! System voltage quickly drops to 12.1 volts and after some city driving, returning home it was down to 11.7 volts. Disconnecting and reconnecting didn't help, although it wasn't long enough to delete board computer stuff. Dunno how long that needs to be.

The battery is on the charger again and charge voltage climbs so slow (starting to struggle at around 12.5 volts, right now it's at 12.83 volts) that there must have been really quite the drain on it. I don't know how much a car draws in operation without charging. - But how can this be?? The car had Toyota service when I bought it used in August or so, and now just from dis- and reconnecting the battery the alternator doesn't work anymore??

Please help! I have so many other problems piling on top of this, and it is weekend of all things."

Car won't hold a charge
I drive a 2017 Kia Optima LX. I live in the Midwest and we've had some pretty cold nights last two weeks. Every night the cold temperatures just sap the battery and it won't start the following morning.

Usually this isn't a huge deal because I have a portable charger and would just wake up an hour earlier and hook the car up to the charger and it would start without an issue. The problem that has started is since Monday after I charge it (If it matters, the portable charger has a couple extra lights such as ""Charged/Maintaining"" and ""Bad Battery' which both light up when I come out to check) I'll unhook the charger. Between the 15-30 seconds that it takes me to unhook the charger and get into the car when I turn the car on it won't turn over and just sputters. I'll have to pop the hood and hook the charger back up. After about 5 or so minutes of it charging the car will turn over and stays running after I unhook the charger. However, if I turn the car off for even 10 seconds it won't turn back on and needs to be hooked back up to the charger. After I drive it around it seems to be fine (i can turn it off and it will turn back on later in the day) and doesn't show any lights or error messages. 


I'm assuming I just need a new battery since it's the original battery that came with the car but wanted to see if there were any other possibilities before I went out and spent a couple $100.

I don't know if it's even worth mentioning, but also feel to add that the car battery has never ""died"" during this time. In the mornings when I try to turn it on, it will still do the ""click"" and the dashboard lights will light up as if it's trying to turn on. There hasn't been a point where there isn't a response when trying to turn the car on."

❓What Equipment Do I Need To Replace My Crankshaft, Con Rods, Bearings and Piston Rings ❓
**Kia Sportage LX 2016, 2.4L, 110k miles - Engine Light & Top End Rattle/Knocking**

Here is where I am at....

**TL;DR - Contemplating replacing crankshaft, connecting rods and bearings. How many specialized tools do I need, can I do it without removing the engine from the car, what other costs will I have like gaskets, silicone, oil etc?**

**Problem**:

\-Initially had P0014 code - Exhaust camshaft position timing over-advanced (Bank 1)  
\-Then had P0016 code - Crankshaft Position – Camshaft Position Correlation (Bank 1 Sensor A)  
\-Engine wont rev above 2,000 RPM without top of engine rattling and making a lot of noise  
\-Engine splutters under any load when driving.  
\-Check engine light has been reset and is no longer showing  
\-No OBD codes despite the engine sounding awful

**Possible reasons:**

🆕 Defective/damaged Camshaft Position Sensor (changed)  
👍 Defective/damaged VVT Solenoid (tested and functional)  
🆕 Defective/damaged timing chain & tensioners (changed)  
👍 Engine is somehow gotten itself out of time, so camshaft/timing needs reset (reset)  
❓Damaged camshafts  
🤦‍♂️ Low oil

**What I have tried so far:**

❌ Oil level checked, it literally didn't register on the dipstick?! The oil/filter was changed in July and level was fine when they showed me the dipstick. I added almost 4 quarts of oil to get it above minimum level. (I know, I know, check the oil!!)

❌ Checked exhaust VVT solenoid - Correct volts in wiring loom, within ohms limits and operates when power applied. Thoroughly cleaned it and reinstalled. (see image)

❌ Replaced camshaft position sensor. Wiring loom has correct voltages. Not able to test old sensor due to sealed wiring connector so could not test voltage draw when metal applied to sensor. Replaced as assumed it was faulty due to lack of testing ability. 

❌ Checked timing marks were all aligned. They weren't, inlet cam was misaligned. (see image)

❌ Changed timing chain and oil pump chain.

❌ Changed all tensioners

❌ Changed drive belt.

❌ Removed oil pan, thoroughly cleaned it

❌ Removed as much sludge as possible from inside the engine

❌ Checked spark plugs (look slightly melted and coated (see image)

**Next steps I am considering:**

⚠️ Remove camshafts, inspect for wear and if required, replace them  
⚠️ Split the engine and inspect the crankshaft and if required, fix issues  
⚠️ Split the engine and inspect the crankshaft and if required, fix issues

**My request:**

What else am I missing or should I be considering as the Kia dealership is not an option as they want to charge a fortune just to diagnose the issue.

I am thinking the likely culprit would be the camshaft sprockets are defective and skipping and/or the crankshaft bearings. I am more than competent and can do the work myself if I don't need to remove the engine from the car.

Being blunt, I am down to my last $600 and just don't have the money to fix the issues myself, never mind a dealer!"

Please Help, Need Advice
So about a month and a half ago I took my suburban into the mechanic because the radiator fan would not turn off when the car turned off and I would get a Reduced Engine Power alert on my dashboard and it would idle absolutely awful and sound even worse. When you turn it off and back on it would fix the issue. 

The mechanic told me it was the thermostat for the radiator fan and cleaning of the throttle body for the reduced engine power. Charges me $780 ( I know I’m an idiot for paying that ) 

Well as of this morning I turned the car on and the check engine light was on and got the same reduced engine power alert and was idling and sounding terrible. Turned the car off and back on to fix it and took it to get the code for the check engine light. Here’s everything I’m getting on the Chevy app and the diagnostic report. Clearly the mechanic didn’t fix the problem if I’m getting the same thing happening 6 weeks later. What should I tell the mechanic and does anyone have any idea what the fix would be? TIA!

Also why does the scan show my truck has 96,000 miles when I only have 79,500?

is this reasonably priced?
2013 honda accord v6. 154k miles. timing belt tensioner is failing. they are suggesting i replace everything in that area because any of it can go and id have to pay for labor all over again if anything else went out which makes sense to me. also no work has been done in that area since ive owned the car since 100k miles and carfax is not showing anything on the report of any work in that area also. they use only oem parts. i just wanna know if this is reasonably priced or if i could possibly go somewhere else cheaper."

battery/alternator issue.
2013 Avalon
Car was slow to turn over after leaving it in a freezing lot for 2 days.
Drove it for 5 minutes, turned it off.  car wouldn't start, dim lights, just clicked.  Started it with jump pack.  Drove it home.  Charging system dash light on.  Next morning same problem.  Started it with jump pack again.  As soon as I removed battery clamps it died.  I put a new battery in, dash light gone.  I took it to have alternator checked and they found no problems.  My caveman understanding is that once a car starts, it runs off the alternator.  If it died immediately after removing the jump pack, would that not indicate a bad alternator?"

Want to diagnose spare battery -> low battery jump: anything that could be wrong
I got a new battery a few days back for my 2008 dodge avenger. The battery that's in it is probably damaged in its capacity because it's run low a number of times before, including now, the car won't turn over. It's not totally dead, the electronics come on and it rolls over a couple times before it stops, just not enough juice to push the boulder over the hill.

So I figured: buy a new battery. Because I should be able to A) jump the near-dead battery in the car with it and B) replace it once I can drive it to a garage (I don't have the space to replace it myself and the stupid compartment is just in front of the wheel well).

But the car isn't jumping with the spare battery. I hooked it up, let it sit for 10 minutes (since the spare isn't in a car with a running alternator I assumed there might be a need to balance charge between batteries), and attempted to start the car, but the car behaved as per ""usual"" as if the battery wasn't there.

Just wondering what the possible problems could be.

1) Obviously: bad connection. Connection to the new battery is rock solid because the contacts are new, connection to the bolts that extend up from the battery compartment in my car are partially covered in a thin amount of rust. Attempted to scrape them/dig in the alligator clips several times, still didn't work.

2) Battery too cold? I bought the battery and left it in the car over a few days, but it hasn't gotten below freezing since then yet.

3) Extremely unlikely the new battery is a dud.

Are there any considerations about trying to jump a car with a spare battery I don't know about?"

Parasitic draw? 4 batteries in 5 years.
Hey everyone, thanks for reading. I’ve been working on a possible electric issue with a 2015 Honda CR-V for about a year now where I can’t seem to find the problem. I’m having an issue where my battery continues to discharge after sitting from anywhere between 20 mins to 2 days. 

As a backstory, I have AAA as a yearly gift which have a “lifetime” warranty, and have gotten my battery fully replaced 4 TIMES from them due to the charge of the battery dropping down to 7.5V and not even being jumpable. 

I’ve had the current one I have in now for about 5 months over the summer and autumn with no issues. These batteries seem to be just fine in the warm weather (above 40) but as soon as winter hits and the temp dips below 30, the car no longer starts. I want to rule out an alternator issue as I had no issues with the battery being charged up over the past few months in warm weather, have gotten the grounds on the battery checked out, I have had a mechanic test to look for a parasitic draw. 

I’m at a loss and want to believe there’s no way that every single battery AAA has given me is bad, but I can’t really point to anything else. Anybody see this before and have any thoughts on what it could be? Thanks y’all. "

After repeated repairs on my vehicle I am having issues with the breaks, a very harsh noise when hitting the breaks. What do i do 
I drive a 2020 Mercedes, I don’t know much about cars but learning… I recently replaced the worn coolant hose myself lol. Several months ago my car was making a very loud screeching sound when hitting the breaks. Loud enough for everyone on the street to be staring at me for the noise. I went to an auto repair shop and got it fixed. I don’t really recall exactly what the issue was and what they replaced, which is a problem. But the problem was fixed. I could only afford the front two sections that needed repair, and several weeks later the back sections had the same issue. So I got it fixed. I think it was break pads.


Several weeks go by and I have an issue where my car would not accelerate while flooring it, and it seemed like it had no power and the engine light came on. Apparently I needed to replace the battery. I got it done at the dealership. They told me I should not drive my car because the other end of the coolant hose was busted and it’s dangerous to drive. 

A few days later I get an engine alert on my car. My car then started to shake aggressively when driving. Even when at a red light it was shaking like crazy. So I took it to a Mercedes service center which I have had a good experience at before and they claim to charge half of what the dealership charges. They told me the car needed service, and then after it was serviced they said the rotors need to be replaced immediately. They said nothing was wrong with the coolant hose despite Mercedes dealership saying it was urgent. This is what they fixed:

Ignition coil and spark plugs
Oil change ail filter caving filter and rotation
100 spark
340 coils 
249 labor

They never mentioned anything about my breaks and they said my car was good to go. Well today, I started to feel a very harsh screeching noise when hitting the breaks.  It doesn’t sound good at all. What could this be, and why did they not detect it after doing a diagnostics test on my vehicle? What’s going on?"

Mercedes 2010 gxl 350 won't start
Hello, so my girlfriends gxl 350 2010 will not turn over, the steering wheel and breaks are also locked. We just drove 6 hours to her parents place and we had no trouble with the car until we got here. The next day we woke up went to turn on the car and we got nothing. There is no clicking sound when we try to turn it over and the battery is fully charged. Like I said the steering wheel is locked and so are the breaks. When we put the keys into the ignition it says on her dashboard to take the keys out. What could the problem be and is there anyway for us to fix it? We are pretty far from a dealership and it would cost her 750 to just get towed to the closest one. Has anyone else had this problem? Any advice would be great? "

Faulty Caliper Brackets installed twice now.
This is probably a long shot but I was told I needed to replace the drivers side brake calipers, so we went home and did it ourselves but noticed a heavy bumping sound on the front drivers side when we would hit bumps. We took it in and were told that the refurbished caliper bracket that we got was bad and needed to be replaced, so they warrantied it and replaced it and the shop charged us labor costs. After driving less than 200 miles the sound started happening again so we took it in and have been told that the same problem is happening, and are once again being charged for labor. Has anyone had any luck or know if it's possible to bill the parts store for this incurred labor from faulty refurbished parts? Any advice would be appreciated."

2008 2.4l Saturn Aura, Ecotec Le5, Rapid click No Start.
Recently, I had an issue of no click no start.  After thorough testing, cleaning off all grounds, can bus testing, etc. We pinned it down to ECU, and when I replaced it, it fired right up.  A day later, while driving home from a friend's house about 5 miles away, all of the lights on my dash started coming on one by one, first abs, then traction control, then power steering, etc. I pulled over and when I stopped and shut it off it was back to no click no start. I called a tow and of course, when he picked it up it started right up but I knew that wasn't going to be the end of my issue. He wrongly stated it was the negative battery terminal and told me that ""I need to look after my s---"" as ""Just some friendly advice"" LOL but I changed out the terminals anyway because they were old and needed to be replaced. The next day I tried starting it again with no problem, and let it idle in the driveway to see if the same thing would happen... All lights started appearing again after about 5 minutes.  I had already grinded/cleaned the grounds/contacts thoroughly and tightened them all down perfectly, but not on the starter.  So once I cleaned the 12v contact and the alternator contact that goes onto the starter, as well as both posts and the ground I thought my issues were gone.  It started up great, running better than ever, getting great voltage, acceleration, a/c and everything was running like a dream... The next day I got a rapid click from my starter with no start. I checked every fuse again with the key in the on position and every fuse was working, I already had my battery load tested about 3 weeks before and fully charged, as I mentioned earlier the battery terminals are perfect, tried jumping, tried hitting the starter, bench tested the starter and it popped out and spun perfectly... I have heard that the starter can work on a bench test but when it is put against the pressure of the flywheel it still might be too weak to turn over, buying a new starter will be my last resort since I have had no issues with it before and since smacking it with a hammer didn't work, I think it's really unlikely but still possible, just gotta make sure I have everything covered before I got out and buy a new one. The only other thing I can think of to mention is that the check engine light is on but I am not reading any codes. It is just a $20 reader and I have a friend who has a proper top-end DTC reader/programmer that I will call over if these forum replies don't get me anywhere, but it makes me wonder how my car knows that it's not gonna start even before I turn the key??  
  
Please no questions that I have already addressed such as battery and fuses. Hopefully, I provided enough information.  
Thanks for reading and commenting"

Starting Issues with 2016 Hyundai Elantra SE After Replacing Turn Signal Bulbs
Hi everyone,

I drive a 2016 Hyundai Elantra SE and recently replaced my passenger side front turn signal bulbs with Sylvania brand bulbs following a guide on YouTube. The bulbs worked fine, and I didn't have any issues for a few days.

However, a few days later, I encountered a problem: my key fob wouldn't unlock the car. I had to manually unlock it with the key. When I tried to start the car, it wouldn’t even crank. I attempted to jumpstart it, and while the car's lights came on with the jumper cables attached, the engine still wouldn’t start. I let the battery charge for 30-40 minutes during the jumpstart attempt, but no luck.

Thinking it was a battery issue, I replaced it with a new one. The car ran well again for a few days, but then the same issue reoccurred - the car was completely dead and wouldn’t even attempt to start.

I'm planning to take the car to a mechanic, but I’m curious about a couple of things:

1. Could changing the turn signal bulbs somehow have caused this issue?
2. I’m suspecting it might be an alternator problem given the symptoms, but the timing with the bulb change is concerning. Could there be a connection?
3. I've also read about the possibility of a parasitic drain. Is there a way to test for this at home?

Any insights or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

2010 Ford Escape no start 
Hello Reddit! I’d like to see what you have to say. 

Recently, my 2010 Ford Escape v6 4wd with 170000 miles has had an intermittent starting issue. I’ll start the car on my first try, commute from work, cut the engine, and half the time it won’t start back up for another 4-6 hours. When I start it, there’s a click but no crank. Ive replaced the starter and battery. The weather here has been about + 90*F ever since this issue started. I just got a diagnostic test from a mechanic and he came back saying everything looks fine (no codes and the charging system is fine). There’s also an after market anti theft system on the car, but he said that shouldn’t be affecting it.  

I cannot figure this problem out. Any ideas???"

2007 Ford Edge charging system light
The charging system light will light up somewhat randomly. It will turn back off almost as randomly but also when the rpm gets around 3-4k. Once the rpm gets back down to 2500 and below, it will inevitibly turn back on

I've tested it with the light on and off and the alternator reads at 13.8v. No problems starting.

Pretty much everyone I've talked to has said to just drive it, but I'd really like to not have my light turn on unless there's actually an issue. 

With some research I did see that it could be the belt slipping or one of the pulleys seizing up, but I would think that would cause a drop in voltage. "

Jiffy Lube for AC Compressor Replacement?
My mechanic told me my AC compressor needs to be replaced in my 2005 Tacoma. A mechanic recommended I go to jiffy lube because they would charge a lot less.

Mechanic quoted me $1200, but Jiffy Lube quoted me $760. Money is super tight as I am a college student and I would like to pay less for this repair. I've heard Jiffy Lube is not a reputable place and a lot of the mechanics are not very qualified... I don't want to end up with more problems down the line that are going to cost me even more money if I go to jiffy lube.

Should I not even consider going to Jiffy Lube for this?"

Struggling to Diagnose
I am in desperate need of guidance!! I have a 2015 Nissan Juke SL AWD with just over 140k miles. For most of the time I've had the car it hasn't really needed much maintenance besides oil changes, tires, and brakes. When I bought the car it came with 6 free oil changes and regular maintenance for each of those, so I didn't do much of the work on the car when I first got it. Now that I have been doing the work on the car it seems that everything has been waiting to all fail simultaneously. Of course when I'm already in the midst of financial burden, because I can't really afford to pay for labor. I've been doing my best to do the repairs myself and with a little help from my brother. Neither of us are experts, but can usually handle repairs as long as we can diagnose the problem. That is where I've been struggling for the better part of a month now.

I know that some of the issues I'm having are related and some are not, but I am going to list all the things that I have done on the car in the past several weeks and the issues that I'm having in hopes that someone is about to play Gregory House MD car edition. Not sure if anyone will be able to figure it out without looking at the car, but I figured it couldn't hurt to try. Maybe someone out there will appreciate the challenge.

Repairs completed:  
-New Alternator & Belt  
-New Battery and Battery Terminals (Nissan Dealer installed these)  
-New Valve Cover Gasket  
-New Spark Plugs  
-New Mass Airflow Sensor  
-New Air Filter  
-Idle Relearn  
-New Rear Brake Pads ( Not likely connected)

At first the issue was that the engine was sputtering at idle and when my fiancé was driving it the engine stalled out completely at red lights twice in the same day. The first thing I did was get new spark plugs to replace the plugs, because I couldn't remember changing them. When I went to change those, I pulled out the ignition coil on the 2nd cylinder and it was dripping with oil. There was also a little bit on coil/plug in the 3rd cylinder. Replacing the spark plugs didn't solve the problem. It wasn't until after I replaced these that the check engine light came on and I started to get codes. I have an inexpensive OBDII reader, so I was able to read the codes and reset them to keep tabs on how often the computer was throwing codes. Here is when I first got a 'System Too Lean Bank 1' code.

Here is where my brother started to help and we did a bunch of research and decided that we needed to change the valve cover gasket. My plan was to drive the car to work (about 10 miles), then drive the car over to his place after work and do the repairs. I made it work with no problem, but then when I went out to the car to leave after work and the car wouldn't start. I have a portable jumper battery that I couldn't get to start the car. For some reason while I was trying to get the car jumped, the immobilizer triggered. Because the battery was dead, I couldn't reset the immobilizer and because the immobilizer was triggered I couldn't start the car to jump it. By the time we realized we needed another battery it everything was closed and also while trying to reset the immobilizer we repeatedly removed the battery terminal and the terminal bent and broke. So I chose to have the car towed to a dealership, with the expectations that they would do an inspection of the car and at least tell me what was wrong in addition to turning off the immobilizer. They told me the battery was dead and charged me $450 for a new battery and battery terminal, but DID NOT do an inspection on the car and refused to do anything more on the car unless I agreed to let them fix whatever they found. Sending it to them was a mistake, because I then had to have it towed again to my brothers, because the engine sounded terrible.

There, we replaced the valve cover gasket and put everything back together. In hindsight, I'm not really sure what made me think that was going to magically solve the misfiring issues. After we put everything back together and started everything up the engine was making a distinct grinding noise. We found at the grinding was coming from the alternator and the belt and realized that the alternator was seized. The one detail I will mention that I'm still slightly confused about is that the belt didn't have many cracks on the grooved side, but the backside of the belt was well worn. We checked the tensioner pulley and it spun freely so I didn't believe that to be the issue...now I'm not so sure we shouldn't have investigated more.  So we got a new belt and alternator and tore apart the wheel well and removed the front bumper to fix that. All of this happened on July 4th, just for reference on how long this has been going on. Once that repair was completed, the grinding went away and the engine sounded slightly better, but not completely. But the car was able to drive and it still hasn't completely stalled since. One other note that I can't tell if it's related or not, before I did all these repairs the passenger rear brake light was out. It was on my to do list of repairs, but it seemed to come second to engine repairs. After I did these repairs, all of the lights in that assembly stopped working and only my right turn blinker began blinking twice as fast. My friend told me that it was likely a bulb that needed to be replaced, but I know it was be a fuse or electrical ground issue that causes this to happen.

I had to drive it to and from work at that point. I work in Milwaukee near where the RNC took place, so during that time I was simply too busy to do anything on the car at all. However, it didn't give me some engine codes. At this time I was getting the same 'System Too Lean Bank 1' code and I started getting an 'Idle Air Control System RPM higher than Expected' code. Also, the air conditioner stopped blowing cold air and it still isn't working. I spoke with a friend of mine who is a car guy and he told me that before I try to replace the Idle Air Control Valve I should do an idle relearn and that would likely fix the issue. Before doing this the car had been idling between 1200 - 1600 RPM. After doing the idle relearn the engine didn't seem to be stuttering as often as before and it was idling just about 1000 RPM which seemed closer to the 600-800 RPM my research showed it should be idling at. After doing this, the 'Idle Air Control System RPM' code stopped, but I was still getting the 'System Too Lean' and I soon after I started getting a 'Random/Multiple Cylinder Misfire Detected' code.

At this point, I started to get a major grinding from the rear of the vehicle. Turned out to be brake pad that was down to the metal. I had already purchased pads to change them when we did the other repairs, but we simply ran out of time after having to replace the alternator. I doubt this is helpful, other than to illustrate that there is a lot or work that needed and still needs to be done on the vehicle.

The car continued to throw these same two codes for awhile, even after I would clear them, they would return pretty quickly. After doing some more digging over the next few days, I found multiple sources talking about a test for the mass airflow sensor. According to what I found, if the mass airflow sensor is functioning properly, if you pull the lead off the sensor while the car is running it should immediately shut the engine off. If you remove the lead and the car continues running then the sensor is bad. I did that test and when I disconnected the sensor the engine kept running as if I hadn't even taken it off. So I went and got a new mass airflow sensor. I installed that into the car and to be honest, it seemed to cause the car to stutter and misfire more than it had been before changing it. After changing the mass airflow sensor, the 'System too lean' code stopped, but it was immediately replaced by a 'Intake Air Temperature Sensor 1 Circuit Low'. Also, I took out the spark plugs and checked the gaps to make sure they were correct. This was the second time I had taken the ignition coils out since replacing the valve cover gasket. The first time I took them out everything was dry and when I took them out more recently there was oil on the coil and plug once again. That was Wednesday and since then I've continued to get the Random misfire code and that Intake Air Temperature codes regularly and also a couple days ago I got a 'ISO/SAE reserved' code. From my research, this code isn't going to tell me much by itself, but hopefully it can be useful information to someone who really knows engines.

At this point the car is driving, but the gas mileage has been severely hampered, whenever the car idles it seems like it is going to stall, but it seems to rally at the last second and keeps running. The acceleration isn't always continuous and you can feel a slight loss of power as the engine misfires. I think I've put about 400 miles on the car since the alternator repair. I really hope that continuing to drive it isn't causing more damage to the internals, but I absolutely need to have a vehicle so I haven't really had a choice. At this point, the only other thing I can think of to do is to try to replace the Idle Air Control Valve or the IAT sensor, but I can't help but feel like all I'm doing at this point is throwing money at the car hoping that I guess correctly and I really don't have the money to just keep buying parts hoping to find the right bad part.

If you have read this far, I appreciate you even taking the time to read this far. I really hope that someone out here that really knows engines and Nissans and can somehow sift through all this information to come up with some idea that can point me in the right direction that can help me find the proper diagnoses and fix this. If you can help me you will officially be my favorite person in the world. This is probably my final Hail Mary before I take the car to a shop and struggle to figure out how to pay for the repair as well as the other bills I have that I can't afford."

Aftermarket Radio Troubles...
TL:DR since I imagine the big long post scares people away. I believe the radio has a wiring issue, but the place that installed it is acting like nothing's wrong, but the place I'm at here on vacation claims the whole radio is broken. I don't trust either but the original place I got the radio done keeps letting me make appointments, so am I just kinda doomed to wait until eventually someone actually fixes my radio? 

The radio itself basically resets itself with any jolt or bump of the vehicle. I suspect it's a wiring issue, but the first shop keeps wasting my time, and the second one keeps saying it's the radio itself.

So, I bought my first car at the age of 20. It's nothing crazy, a simple, mostly manual 2018 Nissan Versa S. I don't need anything fancy or expensive as this isn't even a daily driver for me, as I have a work van at home to drive to and from as need be.

All I wanted to do was one simple thing, have an aftermarket radio installed with Android auto for trips. But this entire mess is anything but simple.

Let's start from the top, I found a reputable place that does ""professional radio installs"" has good ratings and all that. I set up my appointment, and I chose my radio from their selection, a Sony XAV-3200. 

First appointment, radio installed, everything was fine, until I woke up the next morning. The radio doesn't turn on or look like it has power going to it. That's strange, but instead of going through the hassle of setting up an appointment right away I just open up the dash myself to investigate. Nothing serious as I didn't take anything apart, I just was hoping I could bandaid a solution as I had big plans on my day off. Upon taking it apart, I found that depending on how I position the wires in the back the radio would turn on and off accordingly. So bad wiring, sick, so I set up another appointment thinking this fix shouldn't take that long then.

Appointment two (the one that infuriates me) luckily they had a free slot for me to come in almost immediately, so I took the opportunity, got there at 9 thinking this will be all good to go soon. How could it possibly go wrong? I sit there for an hour and a half and the guy comes out to me so proud of himself saying that the issue is fixed, how? He reset it... he claimed he didn't need to open the dash, look inside, nothing. How does that work? No fucking idea, but the radio did work, and it was fine for about two weeks (minus the radio problems itself, turns out the Sony radio I chose has faults with wired android auto features, and it didn't support wireless android auto so I'm stuck with a slightly jank but functional radio).

That's until my trip to Missouri, which I'm currently in the middle of as of writing. Radio was working (mostly) fine as it didn't give me any power issues, until the faithful morning I hit the highway for my family visit and the first major road bump I hit. Boom, power died on the radio, and two minutes later the Sony logo pops back up and runs like nothing's happened. At this point I'm fuming, but let go of it for now as I got more important things to worry about at the moment, like driving and having fun on my vacation.

This brings me to today, while out fun shopping, I noticed a different aftermarket shop called ""CustomSounds"" and I ask my great uncle about it, they did him very good, so I go in and explain my situation to them about it. I paid them $100 for a diagnostic, and they come back to me explaining how the wiring they did was fucked up, but the radio is ""broken"", and how I'm gonna need a new radio. They said something about how the steering wheel controls that they failed to do (which they refunded me for) was causing some voltage issue and the power going to the radio was what's causing it to fail. That didn't sit right with me though because I'm still thinking ""why would this be a radio issue if this problem only happened when the vehicle hits a physical bump or jolts in anyway?"" But I let them talk me through the nifty griddy of looking at their wares and seeing into a new radio. Long story short, they were too pricy, sorry but I think 1500 for a radio install that you yourself said ""didn't need much work as all the main stuffs here already"" just didn't sound like the right choice.

I got a receipt, and a diagnostic on paper, and I called my original shop again and they set me up an appointment for next Friday, when I'm home. Free of charge, no moneys outta my wallet, but what I want to know is should I hand the guys at home the diagnostic and work they did up here? 

I went in because I wanted some proof that the work these guys in my home state did is total bs, but at the same time they aren't charging me when I keep bringing my car back for them to work on it back home. But I'm also not wanting to hear more fancy wording for ""I did jack shit here ya go"" and I sure as hell don't wanna keep coming back, your gift cards mean nothing to me when the work I paid for is still not working as needed 3-4 appointments in.

Again sorry for the long LONG story, but I assume detail is what's gonna be needed here. I'm not experienced in this and I just don't want to make a costly mistake.

I appreciate any and all help guys, thanks!

Edit: my first appointment I asked for them to get my steering wheel controls to work for extra. That's what I'm referring to when I mention the ""CustomSounds"" diagnostic bringing it up later."

Am I not recharging my AC refrigerant correctly or is something else going on?
The AC in my 2007 dodge grand caravan has always needed to be charged once or twice every two years. A family member has always done this for me and when it's done the AC works great all summer and usually needs to be done again next season.

It wasn't done at all last year and seemed to work great, but this year barely any cool. We've fallen out with previously mentioned family member so I picked up the tube and gauge from amazon and bought a couple of cans of refrigerant.

I followed this [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q7fIf3N1cI](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1Q7fIf3N1cI) but when I got everything connected the gauge was already on the yellow/red change line.

Am I doing something wrong or could it be fully charged and something else is the problem? I did have a hard time getting the tube onto the valve, but I'm fairly confident it was connected up correctly.

Mechanic didn't repair A/C, still got charged.
I dont know what the right answer is. I took my car in to repair the AC. They charged $300+ to recharge the system. I got the car back it still didnt work. Brought the car again to the mechanic. They said it needs a new compressor for $1200. If I knew that in the beginning I wouldnt have gone forward. Along with other repairs needed, Im considering getting a new car.

I know the freon is expensive, but should I owe $300+ when they didnt properly diagnose or fix the problem?"

Having a heck of a time with my AC
Hoping someone with more knowledge than myself can help with this everlasting issue…

2001 Silverado. About two years ago, my clutch on my compressor went out. Replaced the whole compressor. Mechanic accidentally overcharged it and blew out the high pressure switch. By that point, it was fall and I decided to give up. Worth noting, it’s a mechanic at the company I work for, so no real reason to “take t back to the shop and tell them to try again” since it’s a personal favor and didn’t cost me anything. 

Fast forward to today. It’s hot again and I can’t stand it. I replaced the high pressure switch, sucked for air for about an hour, and vacuum tested to find no leaks. Charged it up to 1.7 lbs (it says 1.8, but we ran out of refrigerant). 

It was blowing cold during the charging process, but when we took everything off, it started blowing hot. 

I know it’s not at the 1.8 recommended dose, but is .1lbs gonna make that difference? Also worth noting at the time of the compressor change, the receiver/dryer was replaced, and the orface tube was cleaned out. 

I’m at about my end with this thing. I just want air conditioning. Most components have been replaced and it still doesn’t want to stay cold. I’m not a mechanic, nor an AC guy, so I don’t know what’s next. I don’t have thousands of dollars to shell out for an AC shop to fix whatever the problem is, and the truck has 230k miles so spending more than the truck is worth doesn’t seem appropriate either. 

Is there something I’m missing? Or any tips to not sweat to death this summer? 

Edit: low pressure is at 90, high is at 175. Seems the low pressure is too high. I’m reading online it should be closer to 40-50. I don’t know much about AC systems, but not sure how it can have too much pressure if it was never fully charged. Or how to lose pressure without losing all of the pag oil. And keeping everything legal the whole time."

Wireless remote controlled horn that can be mounted somewhere under the hood?
Driving a 2009 Hyundai Elantra for which the alarm system/horn keeps going off, so I pulled the relay for the horn. I have a great mechanic but he doesn’t want to try to fix this problem. He says take it to the dealership. I’m expecting the dealership to charge a lot to find and fix the short that’s evidently causing the horn to go off all the time. 

It’s a 15 year old car. Dependeable ride, looks fine for its vintage. But I’m not keen on spending a lot of money on something like this. That being said, since I pulled the relay it feels helpless to not have a horn!

I’ve been looking on Amazon for a horn that could even be AA battery operated that I could mount somewhere on the engine block and use a wireless remote control. I’ve found some horns for bicycles that might work... Not sure if they’ll be loud enough if mounted under the hood though. Just wondering if anyone has any good recommendation along the lines I’m exploring here to come up with an acceptable workaround for this. TYIA!"

OBD ELM - Connecting to device, reading infos but not connecting to ECU

I have 2x OBD Elm327. One V1.5, another v2.1. Both Connects to the car > mobile. I can Read motor RPM, temperature, Engine pressure, battery charge, and some more infos, but does not connect to ECU. It always says: ""No connection to ECU"" like an error. I cannot read errors, or most sensor values. My Car is a VAG car from 2003 - Ibiza 6L

* I've tested on mobile, with the most known app's - around 10 different apps.
* Also tested on PC connected to the device by Bluetooth with windows different software's

Can anyone give me some infos about, how can I test the connection to find what is happening? Why does the app's ( i tested many different ones) are connecting to device, connect to the car, read some infos, but I cant access the most data and infos? Any possible solution?

I'm afraid in to buy a new and a more expensive device but that happen the same and also didnt work, if there is a car/fuse/relay problem or something.

PS: I've tried different protocol, configurations, BT/BT LE 4.0 etc. I've lost dozen hours around this. I also reset the mesmory battery, by removing the cables for 30/60mins, in order to try that solution, but no luck.

Im trying to understand what is happening - since im IT experiencied, but im not a PRO on Car/OBD.

PS2: Not sure if it was a coincidence or not, but meanwhile, my wiper blades stop working on automatic timing mode. They work, but stop working on this function.

2012 Dodge Grand Caravan Weird Blower Problem
Car is around 160k miles. Has front blower fans only. No rear vents.

List of symptoms 
- intermittent blower fan. Starts blowing strong and from the front vents. After driving for some time (20-30 minutes) air from vents reduces heavily. I cannot tell if it's fan speed reducing or dampers closing. Air does not seem to blow from any other areas.

- ac needs recharged. I've topped it off but I know for a fact there's non-condensables and it's not properly cooling. I plan to fix this issue but I want to solve the fan issue first if possible.

- after replacing the resistor fan sometimes pulses on and off during idle which can be corrected by reducing fan speed.

When we first bought the van I noticed a high pitched sound from the blower that could be fixed by adjusting fan speed. Found that I needed to replace the resistor.

After replacing the resistor (aftermarket eBay purchase) the fan immediately produced much more power but started exhibiting a strange issue where it would pulse on and off at idle, and at other times would cut out when interacting with the door locks.

Another anecdote is that we recently drove a few hundred miles. On a long stretch of highway there was nearly no air from the vents. (85F outside) We pulled off the highway to turn and got stuck by a long light. After idling for a moment fan started pulsing severely. I lowered the fan speed, the pulsing stopped AND the air starting blower stronger from the vents. I also noticed that the air was not particularly cold but I expected that because we were idling and the ac isn't charged properly.

I'm at a loss. It's clearly electrical, but I don't know whats causing me the problem. 

I'm confident in my diagnostic skills and know how to use a multimeter. Just don't know where to start. Sorry for the major info dump!

Thanks!"

I feel like I got overcharged at the mechanic shop
I just got a 2019 Tacoma TRD Off-road and it’s the first time that I’ve ever owned a vehicle this nice, and that I care about a lot.

With that being said, I took it in for a pre purchase inspection (at a large shop with many locations, not a ma and pa) and they mentioned that the front left inner tie rod needed replacing, and an alignment would be necessary after that. The guy helping me gave me a rough estimate that it would cost around 150 for that repair.

So about 3 weeks after owning the vehicle I took it into the same shop, and they said that for parts and labor the inner tie rod would be a $190 dollar fix, and the alignment would cost $120 on top of that. That seems really steep especially when the tie rod parts I’ve found online are a lot less expensive. 

I typically do any repairs or maintenance myself on my vehicles, however since this also required an alignment I decided it would be best to take it into a shop. And maybe I misunderstood the first time around, but being charged $325 dollars for this repair seems very steep and very different from what I was initially told. Maybe the problem was I went with a franchised location instead of a ma and pa shop, or maybe I am being charged a fair price.. I just don’t have a lot of experience at shops because I typically like to DIY anything that pops up.

Did I get overcharged at the mechanic shop??"

Faulty battery or need to drive more ?
So my car battery randomly stopped working. It required jumpstarting with another vehicle and it was working fine again. This happened once before last year. The car is over 8 years old and I just thought it was a faulty battery. My dad took it to a mechanic and he told me that there's nothing wrong with the battery, I just need to drive long distances like over 100 miles in order for the battery to sufficiently charge? Is this true? Do I replace the battery or just need to drive it more?
The problem is that I don't drive very long distances, I only go to work and gym and that's it. I don't have much of a social life so I don't really travel for leisure. Can anyone advice me on this please? 
Thanks"

Car won't start 2006 Chrysler 300
Cutting to the chase, engine would occasionally turn off by itself seconds after turning it on, had to rev and shift to keep it running and worked fine for weeks. Until 2 days ago, turned it on and 5 seconds later engine turned off, did this 3 times, but the 4th time there was no clank, no sound, nothing, the only thing I could hear was the throttle making a faint high pitched noise. Battery is good charged working good, I do get a blinking engine light and a still thunderbolt light. Tapped the starter to see if it was the problem but still nothing, note that when I turn the ignition there is no clank sound, just the throttle making this noise. I don't want to jump to conclusions and buy parts that don't need replacing, what do you suggest the problem might be? And it has gas in case y'all ask, and all the fluids are filled properly and recent. Thanks in advance.

Update: Found the problem, so my key fob had opened recently but i didn’t not see a circuit or anything so I thought nothing of it, turns out though it has a transponder, it was the size of a rice, thank God I didn’t lose it outside the car. I really appreciate the help guys thank you 🙏 "

Accelerates on it's own
2014 Ford cmax hybrid. Accelerator does nothing but car accelerates on it's own to to 35mph won't go faster. Same for reverse. Just drove at about two and a half miles to the mechanic shop and dropped it off. It was overheating previously when the engine came on but I guess that problems fixed because the engine doesn't come on anymore. It's sad for several days and I think it has a parasitic drain because the battery was very low I had to jump start it so it's possible the computer was just wacky because of the low voltage and this goes away on its own with a decent charge?"

2010 Jetta with persistent electronic issues (long, sorry)
Hello all,

I apologize if any of this has been covered here, and have tried to use the search function (without good success). Crossposted from r/Volkswagen.  I’m pretty much at wits end and I’m hoping somebody here has a guess (guessing r/Volkswagen is mostly enthusiasts and less mechanics). Apologies in advance if there’s too much info.

I have a 2010 Jetta (now 170k miles), and it’s probably my favorite car I’ve ever owned. Bought it in Florida (where we lived) early 2017 at around 150k miles. It was trouble free. Drove it (a lot). Never a MIL/CEL, 25+ MPG, regular maintenance.

When Hurricane Irma hit (2017), we left the Jetta in Florida when we fled north (roads were jamb packed so we took a train). Came back a week later to find sand all over it, but no obvious problems or damage. Didn’t try to start it until I vacuumed all the sand away (didn’t make it to the air filter, but was on the exterior of the engine). I’m only mentioning this because some kind of damage could have happened here that we didn’t realize at the time.

Eventually moved to PA. Continued to drive it without major incident (it needed some work like brake booster, brakes, tires, but nothing surprising for its age).

Parked it around the beginning of COVID. Didn’t touch it for over a year (yeah… I know). When we went to start it, the battery was dead. I didn’t even try to charge it, just replaced it. Made sure the engine had oil (needed to add a little), started right up. Put dry gas in the tank, drove it straight for an oil change. It did run a little rough (that gas wasn’t great). A couple cycles of burning off crap gas and putting fresh stuff in cleared it up (or seemed to). Not too long after, popped a MIL/CEL. Here’s where the fun begins.

Used a Carista I’ve had laying around to scan the OBD-II port for codes:

3092 Control Module Defective  
P1624 MIL Active  
P0811 Excessive Clutch A Slippage  
P0327 Knock Sensor 1 Circuit Low Bank 1 or Single Sensor

I assumed any kind of knock anything could be related to bad fuel. More dry gas, ran the tank as low as I dared, put fresh gas in. Cleared the codes, P0811 came right back, but the MIL stayed off long enough to pass an emissions test, and that seemed great to me. Have never seen the P0327 come back since.

P3092 and P0606 Persisted. Took it to a dealer, they claimed it needed a new TCU and a new ECU. Only $9000 for both. I passed, took it to the other dealer (one about 4 miles each way from my house). Other dealer said that oil was leaking on a connector that had CAN data, and there was a good chance that replacing the valve cover gasket and cleaning the oil would fix the CAN related problems (maybe the 3092).

That didn’t work. They suggested I scrap the car, since the repairs were way more than it was worth. I declined, kept driving it. 3092 cleared itself after about a month.

It continued with the P0811 (Excessive Clutch “A” Slippage) and added a P2626 to the mix (Heated Oxygen Sensor (Bank 1 Sensor 1) Pumping Current Trim Circuit). The P2626 would come and go. Took it to the dealer, they swore I needed an oxygen sensor. So $1,000 later, I had a new O2 sensor and still had the P2626.

So this is where we are today:

1. Persistent P0811 (even if you clear codes, it comes right back). If you disconnect/reconnect the battery, it will be gone for about 50 miles then comes back.
2. Persistent P2626 (this one also returns very quickly).
3. The carista has never been able to connect to the transmission on the OBD-II port.
4. The torque converter no longer locks. I can’t place when that stopped/started happening.
5. When braking hard and the transmission needs to quickly downshift, it has a very hard downshift.
6. Oil leaks worse now than ever.
7. Those things aside, it still drives great.

I am half tempted to return to the dealer who fixed the valve cover gasket and ask them if that’s where it’s leaking from. Have taken it to an independent shop who said the car isn’t worth fixing since the codes don’t stay clear. They said it might “need a computer.”

I know a thing or two about electronics, and I am having a hard time believing that the ECU is actually defective. I strongly suspect wiring harness damage or connector corrosion somewhere, but really don’t know where to look.

TLDR: Persistent P0811/P2626 not fixed by replacing O2 sensor, torque converter doesn't lock, no OBD comms to transmission. Want to fix problems so car passes emissions.

Any ideas?"

Can I ask my transmission to be changed out while I am still under warranty even if it hasn't failed yet?
 So my car has two issues that may or may not be related to one another, and may or may not be related to my CVT Transmission. One of the issues is sometimes when I press the break, and then go transition the gear stick from “park” to “reverse” or something, it kinda gets stuck, so I don’t force it. Instead I let go of the break, re-step on it, and then try again and it transitions seamlessly with no problem. The other issue is sometimes when I reverse out of a parking spot for example, and then I go to step on the break so as to transition to “drive”, when I step on the break it works, like the car stops, but there isn’t the typical “pressure resistance” (don’t know how to describe it) when I step down on the break. The pedal just goes down like if there is no air pressure or something. Anyways, I just wanted to give you all some background detail. But the real question is that I am afraid that maybe these issues have to do with the CVT transmission because they doesn’t exactly have the best reputation. This car has already had some few problems in the past, and before hand due to some other problem I had (afraid at the time it was Transmission as well), I called corporate to see if they could give me warranty extension on my transmission. They did, but it only covers up until a certain mileage, 85,000 miles. And I am getting very close to that. So my fear is that these issues are related to the CVT, and that it will completely break after I surpass that mileage warranty. I know if I bring it in to the dealership, they are going to charge me (just like before) for a diagnostic testing for the two aforementioned issues, but I get the feeling that if the deeper lying issue really is the CVT, they are just going to say it is something else and not change it out. In other words, I am afraid that it (CVT) will break and it will be too late because I will have already passed the warranty extension. I don’t suppose I can just demand that I make use of my warranty extension and ask them to replace the CVT now? Any help is appreciated.

Thank You"

RBSS (Right Blind Spot Sensor)

Radio  
B2206-00 current VIN (Vehicle Identification Number) missing/mismatch

Information End:

Problems Start:

While accelerating (within a minute of when I start to drive after the vehicle is started (even with a warmup period)) or braking (when traction control engages especially)  the center stack/radio/gauge cluster restarts (it seems to suddenly lose power and then immediately turns back on). In addition, sometimes my electrical power steering will lock up and I lose the ability to steer. During this period the steering light comes on and then goes off moments later as I regain control. Separately sometimes the car lags and or jerks on acceleration seeming like it's almost stalling. This has happened three times; once while I was backing up and twice while I was driving forward. It has also stalled out completely around 8 times total. All of this occurs during winter months in cold weather. I've had no issues in the summer.

During winters (cold weather) my center stack (radio/volume/heat/ac) will sometimes refuse to turn on (Black screen / no touch or physical controls). However, I can still control the radio with my steering wheel controls. This issue resolves itself in time or I can disconnect my battery and clear the system of electricity by putting a piece of metal between the two battery terminals (Cables not the battery itself). When I do this procedure, everything will start working again but the engine light will become lit for up to two days before shutting itself off. It is an intermittent issue. I’ve had the car in the Brandon MB Murray Chrysler Dodge dealership for repair many times over the years while the car was still under warranty. The same issue would reoccur after every visit. Eventually the issue reoccurred once the car was out of warranty. I went back to the same dealership and they said they would fix it under warranty as the issue had a long history while under warranty. They decided it was a humidity sensor issue and decided to charge me $2,000 for it since that problem would not have been covered under warranty even if I had warranty left. Essentially we went straight from “it is covered under warranty” to “you owe us $2,000” without any communication. I only found out when I went to pick it up and I was forced to argue my consumer rights as they never informed me I would be charged anything before doing the work. Their service manager made me feel like garbage.  After that was dealt with I got the car back and the issue was still not fixed as it reoccurred only a couple days later. I couldn't bring it back to that shop. I’ve essentially given up just dealing with the issue until now. I've had no issues in the summer while generally it happens a dozen times or more each winter.

Once now recently after remote starting my car a few lights stayed on regarding traction control and the ((!)) one. Restarting my car made them go away.

Less of a problem but I would like to figure out a good way to deal with moisture in my cabin. While driving with multiple people in the car in the winter my windows fog like crazy making it dangerous. Additionally ice will form on the inside of my windows often. Very annoying.

These are the main issues I would like to resolve. The issue is as problematic as ever (5 times in a week).

Problems End:

Other issues I've experienced during ownership of this car in case it helps the diagnosis:

The wiring that goes into my trunk hatch gets kinked on the right hinge where it's routed and has broken wires before. We have had fixed professionally recently.

My signal light bulb which on physical inspection looks fine would start and stop working multiple times. Replacing the bulb has fixed it before. Additionally, where the bulb connects looks slightly burnt.

I have replaced the battery. I have also replaced a faulty backup camera. I've had my windshield washer fluid freeze twice and blow the hose due to oil change places putting the wrong fluid in just before winter.

I have blown the fuse for my cigarette lighter twice.

A can of Pepsi exploded in my glove box when a friend left it in there. It soaked into a lot of paper in there so I'm not sure if it did drip down into anything else. I did ask a detailing company to check and clean it and they reported it did not leave the glovebox.

Occasionally my heat/air conditioning gets incredibly loud. This is always resolved itself in a day. I’ve just replaced my blower motor and it has been replaced before.

The button to open my trunk has stopped working before. It is always fixed itself within a day.

My engine will go from idling at 1.25 to idling at 2 sometimes.

When I enable my rear defrost I feel a vibration and it has messed with my radio signal before. The vibration is repeatable. The radio disturbance is repeatable when it happens. Turn it off the radio is fine. Turn it on radio goes static.

I have noticed my fuel mileage is worse than it used to be both in summer and winter.

My Bluetooth will sometimes stop functioning until I reset the system via the battery.

The engine seems to shake a decent amount. Not sure if that is normal.

I had an older mechanic friend of mine replace the spark plugs some time ago.

I use seafoam in the gas tank occasionally (once or twice a year).

It seems to take longer for the car to heat up in the winter months.

Advice? Help?"

2006 Toyota 4Runner Electrical Problems
Battery indicator came on. Disconnected the battery, noticed my negative terminal to ground fender cable (8awg) was almost completely torn through. Replaced that with a 6awg cable, then reconnected the battery. Started the engine, sounded a little weak, like maybe the voltage was low, then I let the car run for about 10 mins. Noticed there was a little bit of smoke coming from the engine bay, so I turned the car off and disconnected the battery. 

When I tried to reconnect the battery, way more spark than normal. 

Took the battery to AutoZone, they tested it and said it was a bad battery, but that it was only at 64% charge. Then they charged it to 100%, retested it, said its all good. 

Go to reconnect the battery, voltage is 12.60 before reconnecting. Reconnect it, while it is hooked up to the car (car is off), voltage reads 10.73, which I know is not where it should be, so I disconnect the battery again. Now voltage is around 11.00. What is happening? I am not new to car repairs but I have never had to do anything electrical, can someone please give me any pointers as to what the problem may be?

What could be the problem if it’s not a parasitic draw?
I have a 07 Honda Odyssey that dies every few days if I don’t drive it. It has a new alternator and new battery.
Someone suggested it might be my usb cigarette lighter charger so I pulled it out and the next day it died again.
Someone suggested it was a parasitic draw so I had a friend who knows about cars do the test, charged the car for a full day to do the test and he says The multimeter is reading .03 milliamp draw one specs are .05 or less. He says it’s not a parasitic draw and he’s stumped. 
I read its possible it could be a problem with the sliding door causing the issue. And that it’s a issue with Honda Odyssey minivans. Both doors are extremely hard to open.  Before I break down and just go to a mechanic Anyone have any suggestions??"

Help! Car won't start 2013 Volvo XC60 3.2L with 68000 miles
Hello, my car randomly would not start while trying to drive back from the grocery store the other day. The series of events that occurred have left me scratching my head on what could be wrong.

I drove to the grocery store with no problems, nothing out of the ordinary happened on the drive that would lead to any problems.

When I left the grocery store, the car would not start but all the lights outside and inside came on. I didn't think it was a battery issue but out of desperation to get home, I asked someone for a jump. The first jump, nothing happened. We cleaned the terminals of some minor corrosion and jumped again and the car sprang to life.

I was able to drive the car home and park it, but after I stopped the car, I attempted to restart it and again, would not start.

The next day, assuming it was a battery issue, I tried to charge the battery and had a full indication but the car still wouldn't start. This being the case, I went and bought a new battery and installed it in the car and still no start.

I asked my neighbor to give me another jump to see if I can start it again but I had no luck this time.

&#x200B;

From what I can make out, the starter fuse has continuity and the batteries, old and new, read 12.7V and 12.9V respectively. I'm also guessing that the starter is fine because it was able to start with the jump from the car at the grocery store. The only new indication on the dash is a check engine light that comes on after a failed start. I borrowed an OBDII reader from the local auto parts store but it doesn't show any specific error code (although I am not super familiar on how to use these).

My best guess is that there is some sort of electrical issue but for the life of me, I can't pinpoint it. I'm not sure what I should do for a next step.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

&#x200B;

Edit: When I press the ignition, the dash lights up like it normally would and I hear a soft hum but no clicking or any other noise. After a few seconds, the dash goes to normal and a simple ""Check Engine Light"" comes on."

Alternator/Generator brushes worn out or ok?
Hey guys,
may Chevrolet Aveo from 2006 (135.000km) did something funny a few days ago. When I wanted to start it, I didn’t turn on because the battery was low. So I jumpstarted it with the help of another car. When I wanted to drive, I turned on the headlights and the car turned off. So I thought I’d check if the battery is charging, when the car is on. After jumpstarting the the car again, I checked the voltage and it wasn’t around 14V. Just 10 and slowly dropping. So it is pretty obvious that there is something wrong with the generator of the car. After having it taken out, I checked the brushes and now I wonder if this is the problem. Is there anybody who might know, if the connection between the brushes and the Generator itself looks worn?

Happy for any help! Thank you guys :)

Parasitic drawdown - 2008 Ford Fusion
 

Hi there, I've had recent problems with the car draining the battery within 48 hours. In the spring the mechanic replaced the battery and worked on the alternator. Unfortunately this didn't seem to work, and we then eventually replaced the smart junction box, which required a lot of work to explore repair options, and to find a part from a wrecker.

I'm no expert on car electrical, but the 96R battery charge levels are not inspiring confidence - and I'm looking for guidance on levels. The mechanic claimed to have fully charged it on thursday, it sat on their lot until saturday when I picked it up. Took it home and the battery read 12.3v. I then fully charged it to 13.2v. Within 7 hours, it was back around 12.55v, and this morning it's reading 12.28v. This leaves me wondering if the underlying electrical issues have been fixed with my car, as would this not be a low charge? Am I thinking about this right, or can someone else guide my thinking on this topic. Also, for awareness, at what charge level will the car not start, I want to know for my own sake, as I will not likely top this up, as I want to monitor it's charge levels.  


Update: I went for a drive on Sunday, and when I parked, the reading was 12.34v, on monday morning, it's now at 12.21v. is this a normal drawdown?

Thanks"

Does the hourly rate for a mechanic mean every hour my car is there?
I dropped my car off this morning, it’s a 2007 Chevrolet HHR, to see if they could find a fix a problem I’ve been having with my battery (I was told it had a parasitic battery drain before I got it) They said they would have to charge the battery and that could take about an hour, is that something I’d be charged for? I’m fine with paying for that but if they’re working on another car or something I would be less enthusiastic for paying that. I really should have asked, and I tried calling a little bit ago but they didn’t answer. I was also hoping that I would have an update by now and I just don’t know what’s going on. It’s $90 an hour, which I understand is reasonable, but I’m 18, my mom is not financially responsible, I just started college, and I’ve only had a job for 2 months. I have less than $2000 and I don’t get paid for another two weeks."

Toyota Camry XLE, 2009, has problems getting full cold cranking amps to start the engine. What might be wrong? Often needs portable battery jump starter to get the engine to turn over. Why won't it keep the charge?
Car: 2009 Camry XLE, 6 cylinder, 94,000 miles. . Took it to Advanced Auto Parts, and ran a diagnostic, the battery, starter, and alternator all functioned correctly.

A few weeks ago I changed the battery, so it's new. Car starter sounds healthy when trying to start, but can't get that extra ummpf to start. When I attach a portable battery jump starter, I attach it, get right in the car and start the engine, it turns over. All's good. It seems that it's just shy of getting the power it needs to start. Sometimes, it will start the first time I press the button, sometimes it takes 2 or 3 pushes. Other times, it just won't turn over. But add the battery jumper to it and in seconds, it starts.

Asked Toyota what the problem might be, was told ""not getting enough cold cranking amps to start the engine."" Cool, but what possibilities might be the cause of the fault? Afterwards, I used my dremel and buffed the terminals clean as well as the positive and negative connectors.

Lastly, this may have been coincidental timing, but when the battery started giving issues, I noticed on the battery and on the engine some mice poop. I then scrolled through video and saw mice going under the car. Obviously, they have been in there as well. Not to be a red herring, but I know mice can screw up a car as well. This is everything that I am aware of, any ideas on how to fix this myself before likely paying hundreds to the dealership?"

2007 Honda Accord battery drain
Hi, 

I have a Honda Accord 4 cylinder, and my battery drains within 5 days of no driving or charging. Also I drive only 3-4 times a month, so the battery will sit for days on end, probably 20 days at the most, without a trickle charge.

About 6 months ago, I went on a weeklong trip, and the battery was dead.  I thought it might have had to do with heavy rains during my absence, but the battery won't hold a charge past a few days even in dry weather.  However, when I drive it regularly, the battery holds a charge and my car starts without a problem.

I can accept the battery is bad but I wonder if it could be electrical drain in the car.  I haven't replaced the cabin light after it burnt out (although I made sure it is in the off position).  Is there something else I should be looking for, electrical-wise.  "

Charged for Oil Diagnostics but couldn't find any problem
Hello,

I recently took in a car to do a 57-point pre-purchase inspection. Then, the autoshop recommended that due to oil residue in the oil pan, an oil leak diagnostic should be done (costing an additional $300).

After this, the autoshop reported that they didn't find anything, and so they included a dye in the oil and said they would check it in 500 miles since they didn't find anything despite saying that they recommended an oil check.

They didn't find anything after 500 miles and checking the dye again to look for an oil leak. I asked if they would reimburse the cost of the oil diagnostic since it was unnecessary, since they said there was a leak and then didn't find one. They said no, and that it's standard practice. Am I wrong for wanting to leave a bad review since it feels like they added an extra inspection?

2017 Chevy Malibu LS - Alternator
We have this car for us to use at work. In the last 3 months our fleet department has replaced (rebuilt) the alternator 3 times. Several times o er the last couple years we gotten a ""Service Battery Charging System"" warnings. Often it come up when stopped and goes away when we start moving again. Twice we've gotten warning about the battery discharging. One time I ended up stranded trying to get it back to fleet, and the other time my coworker just barely made it back

This last time I brought it to fleet, we got the car back 4 days later. I asked what, besides fixing the alternator, was done to address whatever the underlying problem was. I was simply told that a poorly rebuilt alternator was the underlying problem. 

I'm reaching out to you, mechanics of Reddit. What else could the problem be? Or, have we really been that unlucky with alternators?

Intermittent loss of power steering over 1500rpm
 Hey, I need help. I have done so much research but can't seem to find the problem I am having online. I have a 2007 Toyota Rav4 AWD V6. Just replaced the alternator earlier this year. Yesterday the power steering started to go out as if the battery was low. Got it home and tested the voltage and the battery was on Death's door. Charged it up and popped it back in. I thought there may have been an issue with the alternator but when I started the car and unplugged the battery the car was still running fine which makes me think the alternator was good to go. Brought the battery to AutoZone today to get it tested and it looks like I just got a bad battery. Grabbed a new one and put it in. However, I am still losing power steering whenever hit around 1500rpm and it comes back on once I go to idle. The electronic steering waring light on the dash does not come on at all. The only light that comes on when the steering goes out is the SRS waring light.

TL;DR  
2007 Toyota Rav4 AWD V6  
\>1500rpm = no power steering + SRS waring light."

Volvo XC60 drive belt issues
Hi all, just wanted to know if I could have some thoughts/opinions on my situation with my car (2018 Volvo XC60, T6, 90k miles) 

Last Wednesday on my way to work, a solid yellow check engine light came on. I didn't notice anything different at the moment. 

When leaving work, my friend heard a whirring noise coming from the engine compartment. I may or may not have overreacted and took my car to the nearest open auto shop (Pep Boys) as the Volvo dealership was 30 miles away and I didn't want to sit in rush hour traffic with this issue going on. 

Pep Boys said I had a loose drive belt. They had to order a drive belt tensioner, pulley, idler kit to make the repair. 

I got my car back today. My check engine light was still on which I kind of expected (they told me this issue probably wouldn't have caused it turn on). After being on the interstate for about 5 minutes, I heard something  from the engine compartment, then it felt like something was bouncing around in the compartment while the car felt like it was driving on debris on the road. 

A red battery warning light appeared with the error message ""12v battery charge failure"". My AC stopped cooling. I began to hear a similar but much louder whirring noise like from the beginning. My car would occasionally shudder, and it felt like the car would move faster than usual when not having my foot on the gas or electric brake pedal. 

I did manage to get back to Pep Boys who said they'll look at it tomorrow. 

I'm admittedly anxious and stressed tf out because my original repair kept being delayed, but I am trying to anticipate what's next to come. Are these things that could happen from an improper drive belt install? Or is this a completely separate problem?"

Multiple Issues After Transmission Rebuild on 2015 Chevy Tahoe LT
I recently had my 2015 Chevy Tahoe LT 2wd with 200,000 miles undergo a transmission rebuild, and since then, I've been encountering a range of issues. I'm hoping someone here can provide some insight or advice on what might be causing these problems.

Here's a list of the issues I've been facing, along with a bit of context for each:

1. Battery not staying charged even though i just replaced it with a new battery. At first, i only had to jump it every morning, now it's every couple of hours.
2. Right front turn signal light not working.
3. Dim night lights: The night lights in my Tahoe have become noticeably dimmer. It's become difficult to see the road clearly at night due to this issue.
4. Power liftgate/trailer liftgate warning: I've been intermittently getting a warning related to the power liftgate and trailer liftgate. It's been concerning, especially since it started happening after the transmission rebuild.
5. AC blowing hot air: After the transmission rebuild, my AC has started blowing hot air instead of cold. I've checked the refrigerant levels, and they seem fine.
6. Tire pressure warning lights: The tire pressure warning lights keep coming on, despite me checking and adjusting the tire pressure as needed. It's becoming a bit frustrating to constantly deal with these warnings.
7. Complete failure of power steering.
8. Stabilitrak, stability control indicator, ABS, and loss of speedometer indicator controls: I've noticed that these indicators on my dashboard have been flashing or staying illuminated. Along with this, I've lost control of my speedometer."

Ford Fiesta with start-stop. Battery fully flat once or twice a year. What's happening?
Hi. I own a 2014 Ford Fiesta Titanium X with start-stop, bought in 2016. I'm at my wits end with this recurring fault that nobody seems to be able to find the cause of.

The battery has died about 10 times while I've owned it. Sometimes as quickly as over one night. Numerous friends have tried to help me jump start it when this happens but never successfully and I've always had to call my breakdown service. The mechanic usually hooks up a charging pack (correct term?) and invites me to start the car - and it doesn't work. Invariably, they seem shocked at just how flat my battery is and remark that they have never or rarely seen anything like it.

They've always eventually managed to get it started for me so I could get it to a garage for a proper inspection but the mechanics are always baffled. Almost every time this has happened, I have had the battery changed for a new one (under warranty thankfully) and it's also had a new alternator once but the issue keeps re-occurring. The last two times (both this year), I have not gotten a new battery because they don't think that's the problem. I've just driven round to charge it up and the car seems to be fine for a period of time afterwards but it has failed again a few months later.

I gave the car to an auto-elecrician for two days to check for anything draining the battery but they didn't find any faults. It has died again since this.

**SOMETHING** is **OCCASIONALLY** causing my car's battery to drain very quickly while the car is turned off. I think at least once in the past, while I happened to be at a garage, I asked them to ""health check"" the battery and they said it was almost as good as new. It died a few weeks later.

I am definitely not leaving the lights on or anything else. It would be genuinely difficult to if you tried - the car complains loudly if you try to get out with anything still turned on.

I've considered just getting rid of the car but I don't really want to and I also wouldn't want to sell it to somebody with this fault.

Anybody experienced anything like this or have any ideas at all? Feel free to ask for more information."

Taking car back to mechanic after faulty work
 

I had an engine replacement done on my car and I was aware of the issues prior. There was however, *never* a clunking noise from the front passenger wheel.

After doing the engine replacement, the mechanic said my control arm bushings or control arm was bad and needed replacement. He talked about a noise and I asked him if it was loud and only over bumps and what not. Anyhow, he gets in and shows me. Whenever he brakes there's a very loud clunk noise from the front passenger wheel and same when going over bumps. You can hear it as well sometimes steering. Said he would quote me on Monday and I decided to get a second opinion from our usual mechanic (he was charging more for the swap so we decided to get it done cheaper).

Anyhow 2nd mechanic says that it is NOT the control arm and that he is certain as I am that this sound wasn't there before as he drove the car just a week before the job. He thinks some component is loose (maybe the steering rack) or not on properly when they did the swap and that I should go back to the other guy. I have 6 months labour warranty on his work.

So I'm not aware if this was a deliberate attempt to redirect a problem and squeeze more money out of me or a mistake, but what are my options here?? Can he just deny it and I'm basically on my own?"

Recourse for Never-Ending Repair?
2014 BMW X3 2.8i xDrive with 110,000 miles

Starting in January 2023, the car started shuddering when accelerating. This is noticeable after the engine is warmed up, and especially noticeable when slowly accelerating. I took the car to a BMW dealership for repair. Up until this point, it's been a GREAT vehicle.

1st time in shop for 2 weeks. I was advised that the transfer case needed to be replaced. The cost for repair was $5,400. I wasn't thrilled with the cost, but it would be cheaper than buying a newer car. I picked up the car, and after 15 minutes of driving the exact same problem showed up. They didn't believe me until I took the foreman out for a drive around the block - he noticed the problem within the first minute.

2nd time in shop for 3 weeks. Dealer said the transmission needs to be replaced. Had I known this, I would have dumped the car. I said, ""NO WAY, you misdiagnosed this problem. You fix it."" They conceded their error and replaced the transmission with a used one at no charge. The car drove fine for a month, then the exact same problem came back!

3rd time in shop for 5 weeks (and counting). After 3 weeks without a car, I got in their face and I now have a loaner X3 to get around. No updates, no diagnosis, absolutely nothing. The service advisor said BMW engineers were going to come out and look at my vehicle to get to the root problem, but no other details. Communication with the service advisor and service manager has been abysmal.

At this point, I don't know what to do. Let BMW take their time to figure it out? At what point will the service shop just throw up their hands and give up? I'm still out $5,400, I haven't seen my car in a month, and I'm stuck with a loaner. It's been one week since I've spoken with anyone. This is so frustrating.

UPDATE: 6/14/23 - After 2 months and 10 days, I finally have my car back. No charge from the dealer. New transmission and a couple of other parts replaced."

Engine replacement questions
Hi, I'm getting my engine replaced (4B12 2.4L 4cyl engine Mitsubishi outlander 06-12). I have talked to my mechanic, and I will be supplying a used engine I will pick up from a reputable autoparts store from a wrecked vehicle, that will come with 1-year parts& labour warranty. I have a few questions:  


1) What is ur experience with used engines from wreckers/parts stores and is this a significant risk?  


2) I have been quoted $1,600 AUD for the job is this a reasonable quote?

  
3) This may be a stupid question, but I saw something about core charges. Do u normally get to keep ur old engine (since I'm supplying the new one myself) as I wish to do so? It is only a 120kg engine and shouldn't be too much of a problem for me."

Frustrated with Brakes Squeaking
I'm at my wits end with my car. I drive a 2012 KIA Optima, just over 100,000 miles.  Last summer I had the brakes completely replaced. I had noticed some vibration/shimmy so I had a feeling I needed the brakes looked at. Then I had a close call on the freeway causing me to slam on my brakes and it made the vibration worse. Took car in a week later and had rotors and pads replaced.

About a week later, I noticed my brakes squeaking horribly. Hoping that it was just new brakes doing their thing, I ignored it for a bit. But it got worse and worse. I took the car back in. My mechanic said he didn't see a problem at all but he warrantied the brakes and replaced all of it. Cool. I drive out of there and there is no squeaking. I'm happy...until a few days later when the squeaking happens again. At first it only happened when I was backing out of my driveway which is on a slight incline. So, not too bad. I called my mechanic. He said cool brakes might do that. He also said it might be from all the rain we were suddenly having. Okay. ??? But over time it started happening more and more. Eventually, I was back to constant squeaking whenever I came to a stop.

I recently took it back in and he looked at it again. He said they were definitely glazed. Would that happen in under a year? The new set was put on in July of 22, and I think the replacement due to squeaking was put on around September of 22. I don't ride my brakes or anything. It just seems strange to me that they'd glaze so quickly, but I'm not a mechanic. He replaced it all again no charge and told me he wouldn't do it again and that I have to understand that in our dry, dusty climate it is normal for brakes to squeak. The brakes were quiet for about a week. They're back to squeaking...again.

This is my second car since living in this area (we live in the southwest US, in the desert). My first car never had squeaking brakes. My husband is on his second truck since moving here over a decade ago. Neither truck had/has squeaking brakes. My daughter has had her car for a few years; her brakes don't squeak. This KIA never had an issue until this mechanic replaced my brakes last year.

Is this normal for this climate? Do I just live with it? Should I take it to another mechanic and get a second opinion so to speak. I've been with this mechanic for years. He's a great guy and has never treated me like a clueless woman, and has never seemed to be trying to up sell or fix things that don't need fixing. But this brake issue is different. During our last conversation I did get the impression he was frustrated with me because I want my brakes to stop squeaking.

I could just use some insight, general advice, etc."

2006 Jeep Commander/V6: question about A/C compressor install— specifically, charging
In the ongoing saga of my wife’s Jeep A/C problems, here’s my latest installment:

Tracked down the problem to what I’d feared. Compressor is shot. I’m going to remove the old and install the new. ($300 vs. $1,200 at the shop- not a difficult decision there.)

I’m no certified mechanic, but I’m a quick learner and good problem solver. I like working on our cars because I’m always learning (I’m a teacher) and I just like to do stuff DIY. My goal here is to do this myself without blowing anything up.

YouTube, America’s Dad, has provided me with a wealth of knowledge and it looks like I need a vacuum pump, manifold gauge, etc setup, which I can get on Amazon for $115. Plus refrigerant, that’s another little chunk of $$$. Plus stuff for discharging the system. The total is getting higher, but nowhere near $1200, and I ain’t got that. What I do have is a redheaded wife who is stressing about having no A/C for our baby. 

Is this (discharging, removal/install, charging the system) something that someone with an IQ over 100 could legitimately do in the driveway? I am 100% confident I can do the removal and install. It’s the discharging and charging that I’m mostly concerned about."

Cold A/C Switches to Hot Defrost Intermittently
2010 Dodge Caravan SE V6

I live in Florida so I run my A/C on cold with high fan most of the year.  For the last few months I have had this intermittent problem where the unit suddenly switches to hot air blowing from the defroster vents.  The recirculate button toggles off but other wise the controls show it should be blowing cold from the main cabin vents.

I can get it to switch back by toggling several buttons multiple times - the recirculate button, the A/C on/off button, and the defroster and main cabin vent button.  I cannot figure out a pattern that works every time, I just have to stab them randomly and then the unit figures itself out.

I took it to my mechanic to replace the vent deflector behind the glove box (my own half-assed diagnosis) but I am not sure at this point if he actually did the work or just charged me for it.  He got pissy with me coming in with my own diagnosis, which I perfectly understand.  I could have replaced it myself, and probably should have.

Anyways, has anyone here seen this particular problem?  It smells like some kind of vent armature / position sensor issue, but I can't find enough information online to know where to begin.  I also noticed the problem seems to happen more often when just sitting at a light.  On a long highway trip it keeps blowing cold the whole trip."

Engine replaced under warranty, but charged for spark plugs?
I brought my 2017 Hyundai into the dealership because the auto transmission wasn’t shifting properly. They found a couple of misfire codes in the computer, so told me replacing the spark plugs and doing a fuel system cleaning should fix the problem. They did this, and although the engine stopped throwing codes, they test drove it and it still wasn’t getting the correct amount of power. They investigated further, and it turned out I had a bad engine (failed the BCT test and had scored cylinders).

Engine was replaced under warranty, but they still want to charge me nearly $450 for the diagnostic, spark plugs and fuel system cleaning, because “a new engine doesn’t include spark plugs”. I realize that $450 is pretty egregious for spark plugs, but I did agree to it (before I found out about the engine). The car has 75k miles, so it probably *did* need plugs, but they were probably in worse condition due to the fact that the engine has burned a quart of oil every 1000 miles for the past 4 years (“within normal parameters” per a Hyundai tech).

Anyway, am I getting screwed here?"

Car won't start.
2007 Honda Accord, 180k, 4 Cylinder

Battery is dead from an issue with radio fuse. I had the radio fuse out for a few months because it was causing battery drain. I read online to troubleshoot by taking out and putting back in to reset it. I put it back in and it didn't fix radio problem. I left the fuse in (foolishly) and one day came back to the car and it was making a weird clicking noise. This drained the battery. Last night AAA came and had no luck getting battery charged back up. Put it in a new battery and that didn't help either. He said his computer was showing that the alternator was low and low volts on the battery. He thought the starter was fine.

Depending on how much juice is in the battery, it will try to turn over and start. I just tried a minute ago and harly anything happened but I think that was moreso due to the battery. I've got a portable charger thing and I don't think it is capable of gettting the battery to where it can turn over at this point."

Frozen Starter??
Have a 2020 Honda Passport EX-L. No issues with cold over through 2 Minnesota below zero winters. Now a snow storm with temps in low teens and it won’t start.

Battery has full charge (first thing I checked) and no clicking from starter at all.

Called dealership who said it is a Frozen Starter and a problem they are aware of. Also stated only “fix” is to get vehicle to warm place. They don’t know if it’s a mechanical or electrical issue with the starter. Stated a couple of techs put new starter onto a vehicle and “siliconed the shit out of it” (her words) and the vehicle had same issue some time later.

Anyone ever come across this before and, if so, what was your permanent fix?"

I feel ripped off by a new garage, what do you think
My car was leaking gasoline so I took it to a garage to have it repaired.

&#x200B;

They initially told me over the phone that they needed to do some repair work on it and offered me a quote of $300 + labour.

&#x200B;

Three days later they called me to tell me the car was ready and at a cost of $1100! 

Seems they went well out of their way to purchase a new gas tank and the straps to hold it and the guy was bragging to me that he talked them down from $900 to $700 with shipping included for this new gas tank, which was necessary because mine had rusted over. They charged me for 3 hours of labour.

&#x200B;

I was not having a good day, just exhausted, so I paid and left. 

&#x200B;

Since having the car back, I've noticed that the ""Emissions Control System"" light is now turned on my dashboard and the Cruise Control function is not working.

&#x200B;

What are your thoughts? Did I get screwed over because they did so much work without my full authorization of the costs involved? Any opinions on what could be wrong with the Emissions Control System? How does the Cruise Control relate to all of this?

&#x200B;

Looking for advice as I will be taking my car back there in a couple days to tell them to repair the problems that were not there before they had taken it themselves, but looking for advice from any professionals about general guidance on how to steer the conversation.

&#x200B;

For reference, the car is a 2011 Suzuki SX4 and I know they have stopped making this brand entirely in Canada so I expected that the parts would be fairly expensive. The cost itself doesn't sound astronomical and is somewhat similar to what I was quoted at other places. I am just annoyed they didn't communicate well with me and now there are new problems with my car since having it in the garage.. what would you do in this situation?

Thanks"

Transmission Slipping From Highest Gear, 2012 Ford Escape
Background:

I have a 2012 Ford Escape, pretty much baseline features across the board, 125K miles.

When I drive it on the highway, especially if I put on the cruise control @ \~70mph, the transmission seems to slip down a gear after a few minutes of driving. I feel a jerk, a small slow down, a wrench icon comes on the dash, and the cruise control disables. I can still drive 70+, but it feels like it's working a smidge harder.

If I cut the engine and start it again, the wrench icon goes away and it resumes operating normally until I push it too hard, and then the whole sequence happens again. If I make a few trips in a row where this happens, the check engine light pops on. If I then make a few trips where it doesn't happen, the check engine light goes away.

I'm pretty sure it's a transmission issue, but I wonder if anyone can shed some light on what a mechanic would call this problem and what they'd be likely to charge for it.

I'm going to sell the vehicle (blue book value \~$4,500), and I'm wondering if I'm better off selling it ""as is"" without repairing the problem (but disclosing it of course), or if I should pay to have this fixed and then sell it. Any advice greatly appreciated."

2013 Fiat 500c Pop, 58k miles. Unsure of issue.
Hello. About a month back my car started extremely rough, and I had a low voltage warning and a high coolant temperature warning on the dash. However, once I tried again, it started up fine, and ran the rest of the day. When I checked under the hood, there was battery foam around the negative lead. So, I cleaned that off with baking soda and vinegar. However, the problem persisted, until one day, it just wouldn't start. I tried a few days later, and was able to drive to an auto repair shop, where I had it inspected.

I was told that the battery was leaking acid, and had damaged the negative connector cable critically, so I had those replaced.

When I drove out of the shop, the car started rough again, with the same low voltage warning, and it shook while in park. But, being an idiot, I thought it was just because there was a new battery that hadn't charged properly, so I ignored it.

I just got back from visiting family for Christmas, and found that my car won't start at all. All sorts of lights were on, including the engine light. It made a few knocking sounds, but that was it.

The engine has oil, and the battery starts up all the electrics fine. But when I try to get turnover, I just get a single, regular clicking sound.

Anyone have ideas as to the issue?

Note: I've only had the car for a year, and bought it second hand from a dealership. The car ran fine for the 10k miles I've put on it, including a 3,000 mile road trip. I haven't gotten into any accidents during that time either. The engine is a 1.4L automatic."

Alternator on 2016 Chrysler 200 2.4L seems to underpower car, not replenishing battery. Both battery and alternator bench tests good. What now?
Started with the battery not starting the car, but it charges fine and tested fine as well. Now the car flickers lights and I lose dash display off and on. The car also immediately died when I disconnected the negative terminal. Pulled the alternator today and had it tested, and was shocked that is passed the bench test. Reinstalled alternator and cleaned the connections there and the battery. Same problems after restarting the car. Tomorrow, I am checking the ground from the battery. What should I be checking next?"

Accord went dead but kept running
2003 Honda Accord, 2.4L, 300k miles 

Driving down the interstate and the dash lights/radio etc all went out. Headlights got really dim. Car was still running and responsive with the throttle. Got to a safe spot to pull over and shut it off and it acted like the battery was completely dead. Had someone come jump me, let it charge on the cable for about 15 min, ran fine on the way home. The battery light was illuminated for 15 miles or so but went off after that and had no further issues. Problem repeated itself about 2 weeks later in the rain. I took a new battery out, again, and replaced it and was able to get it home but am pretty scared to take it anywhere now. 

The first time I had the issue replaced the ground cable from the battery, the positive terminal ends, the battery, alternator is working properly. 

Pretty lost with this one."

Car has died 2 times in the past 3 days. Basically brand new battery, never had any problems and need some help.
*2020 Kia Forte. Bought from dealership in January 2022 with 29,000 miles on it, replaced the  battery the car came with with a new one from Autozone around April 2022. Disclaimer: I am not knowledgable on car maintenance/lingo, so please correct me and excuse me if I said something wrong!*

**Some Background:**

Never had any problems with the new car battery until last Wednesday. I came home from work and parked it for the night, came out next morning to go to work and it was seemingly dead. Key fob didn't work, when I turned the key in ignition-- no clicking/sounds and no lights (besides a one faded airbag light on dash). I've had cars die on me in the past but this was new to me, as I am pretty sure I didn't leave any lights on before I locked it that night. And also, I have always heard a rev/clicking or dashboard lights attempt to come on at least when turning the key in the past. So this time, I thought the battery was completely dead... but why is a ""new"" car battery dead all of the sudden?

Anyways, I called Kia and they sent a third party serviceperson over. He basically connected the battery tester/jump start device to the positive/negative and the power came on almost immediately. He told me leave it on (driving is recommended) for at least 40 minutes to recharge battery. I summed up the situation as an accidental light left on at night, battery drained, and now that it's recharged it should be good to go. I drove to work and had no problems...

**Current Situation:**

Until today, when I stopped to get gas and it died again. I researched ""parasitic drain"" and other related stuff, trying to figure out the reason while I waited for another service person. When he arrived, we opened the hood and he connected the clamps to the battery. The car's dashboard immediately starts making noise (like an open door/welcome bell) and I go look inside-- and the dash lights are back on. He says he did not even jump the car, and was even confused as to why my car died. I told about what happened earlier in the week, and he suggested that it could be faulty wiring-- suggested that I bring it to the dealership. Before he left, he said the car is fine, battery reads 12V, nothing looks wrong and advised me to drive around while it charged which is what I did. 

*This only happened a couple hours ago as I am back on my laptop looking to schedule an appointment. Also, there is no indicators flashing on dashboard that mention battery (or anything else).*

**Now does anyone think they know what could be the problem, or if they've had a similar experience?** I am taking it to the shop tomorrow, but I just want to be sure that I can somewhat understand what's wrong before I pay for something unnecessary."

Recent frustrating car repair experience (suggestions appreciated)
I had annoying clicking sounds seemingly under the hood before the driver seat for a while.  It happened sporadically, last for a few to 10 seconds, then gone.  I figure it's something related to the AC system.

&#x200B;

Finally decided to bring it in to a local dealership (which I had good experience with before).  I haven't been there much since COVID though due to difficulty making appointment with them.  This time around I also had to come in in person to make the appointment, then bring the vehicle in a week or so later, because I couldn't get through their phone system.

&#x200B;

Long story short, they said they found the problem and quoted me about $2000, to which I said okay.  There was also a lack of updates along the way and the job was done quite a few days late than expected.

When I finally picked up the SUV, as soon as I drove off the parking lot the sound came up again.  I went back and get the service department manager to ride with me and he was finally able to tell me what the problem likely was (I think he was probably right).  Then they quoted me $1400 on the part and 7 hours of labor $215 per hour, the total cost would be something like $3000.  Of course, I am not going to do it at this point after paying $2000 and not getting the issue fixed.

What you think would be fair here?  I thought of two options:

1. They charge me a lower rate on the labor, whatever that might be.
2. They return some labor money changed on the first job, because they obviously don't worth the money.

It's not a huge deal but I also don't feel right to just let it go like this."

For reference, I have an Alfa romeo 147 1.9 jtd, 2007.
The problem is, that sometimes i still dont have any power. I have not coded the problem out from the dashboard. Could it be, that the car does that automaticilly, as long as the problem persists on the dashboard?
I believe I tightened the rings as well as I could. Or is there something I could have done wrong there?
Hope someone can help me!"

Chevrolet dealer frustration - diagnostic fee
My question up front: Am I being unreasonable here, or is this business as usual?

We have a \~10 year old Chevrolet Equinox with 58k miles. We noticed a slight pulsing sensation through the brake pedal, but otherwise no issues with the vehicle. We suspected it needed new brakes  - definitely pads, maybe rotors too. My wife called the nearest Chevrolet Dealer (Culver City Chevrolet) and spoke with the service department. She provided our vehicle information including make, model, year, trim, and even a VIN number. The representative said that brake pad and rotor replacement would be ""between 700 and 800, including parts, labor, and tax."" This sounds reasonable to us, so we made an appointment and my wife brought the vehicle in the next morning. At that time, she was informed that the dealership charges a $240(!) diagnostic fee that will be applied to any repairs if needed. Because we anticipated a ""$700 to $800"" brake job, we didn't think twice about this fee.

A little while later we received a call from the service representative confirming that the car needs new brake pads and rotors, and that the price will be \~$2700. Questioning this number, I looked up GM Genuine parts on [parts.chevrolet.com](https://parts.chevrolet.com) with the service rep on the phone, and the parts prices that the service department was quoting were over triple what I could see locally from other dealers, and nearly double the listed MSRP, e.g. a single rear rotor was >$380. Moreover, the dealer's shop rate is $240 per hour, which seems excessive for servicing a common, boring vehicle at a Chevrolet dealership in a relatively high cost of living area.

Then it gets worse. The service representative sent an email with a PDF outlining a list of repairs marked in red that ""require immediate attention."" This included brakes and rotors (OK), brake flush (OK), both engine mounts, front lower control arms with bushings, alignment, engine air filter replacement, cabin air filter replacement, EFI service, rear shocks, coolant flush, front wiper blade replacement, oil change, and a transmission flush. The grand total for this work was \~$9200. I know for a fact that the wiper blades and engine air filter did not need replacing because I just replaced them prior to bringing the vehicle in. Clearly something was off here, so we told the service rep that my wife and I needed to discuss and will call him back. It seems awfully peculiar that the listed service items are big money for the shop but don't require very expensive parts and are difficult to verify (e.g. engine mounts, alignment, fluid & filter changes). In the meantime, the service rep sent an email with a PDF pamphlet outlining various ways to finance the repair bill.

We called another Los Angeles area Chevrolet dealer, and they quoted brake pads and rotor replacement to be \~1500. With this knowledge, we told Culver City Chevrolet to not touch the car; we'll pick it up right away. When arriving, they would not give me the keys without paying the $240 diagnostic charge. I protested sternly, but calmly, explaining that the whole reason we brought the vehicle in was because they quoted $700-$800 for brakes. I said the additional bogus $6600 was insulting and predatory. The grand total was nearly the blue book value of the car. They refused to budge and would not give me the keys without me spending the $240 diagnostic charge. The manager ""just left"" (at 4 PM). He explained that the technician put work into diagnosing the car and he needs to be paid (and I agree 100%, but that should be on them, not us). I begrudgingly paid the $240, promptly drove to the another Chevrolet dealership, had the brakes replaced and oil changed and was given a clean bill of vehicle health, then had a wonderful very long road trip without a single issue.

I called the service manager numerous times over the following week attempting discuss a refund of the diagnostic charge. He dodged my calls repeatedly. At this point I filed a dispute with my credit card and my wife lodged a complaint with GM, though that appears to have gone nowhere. Eventually the service manager called to thank me for ""alerting him to a problem with their systems"" and offer a $240 credit for the service department. I said, ""Great, I'd like to use that retroactively on the diagnostic charge,"" since I'm clearly never going back to this dealer and I never received this credit in writing anyway. That comment was met with confusion and the call ended. The credit card dispute is still pending, but it doesn't look likely to end in my favor since according to the credit card company, ""you paid for a diagnosis and they gave you a diagnosis.""

At this point it's more about the principle than the $240. I feel like this was a shakedown of a woman bringing her vehicle in, they wasted our time, stole $240, and forced us to postpone a road trip by a few days. Am I unreasonable to be outraged by this? Is this sort of thing common, and how has it resolved for others here? Perhaps I should be thankful that we dodged a bullet and we're out only the $240 and some aggravation.

Doing some research on the dealer, apparently they have a long history of scamming people. They were previously known as Nissani Bros Chevrolet, but due to shady business and the resulting bad reputation had to change their name: [https://www.yelp.com/biz/nissani-bros-chevrolet-culver-city-3](https://www.yelp.com/biz/nissani-bros-chevrolet-culver-city-3)

tl;dr: Dealer quote wildly higher than phone estimate, suspected scamming, and stuck on the hook for $240 diagnostic fee. Not sure what else to do (if anything)."

Auto shop messed up my car, $800 paid and they’re asking for $500 to fix what they broke.
Edit: Brian agreed that the issue with interior lights not working was most likely from electrical work being done to fix my headlight on their end. Hence why he agreed to waive labor fee and told me to bring it in so they could resolve the issue.

Hi, I’m really stressed and annoyed with this situation and would like some guidance on what do to next. 

I took my car in 6/21 to Caliber Auto (I am now aware it is a collision shop, which i’m told overcharges a lot). I put off maintenance on my car because during the pandemic, I was not driving much at all. I also realized that my registration was expiring, so I wanted to get my car fixed and then inspected to renew my registration.

I got an oil change and some other maintenance done, along with getting a pigtail switch/socket(?) replacement for one of my headlights that had gone out, and the total came out to be over $800. I paid it, they worked on my car, and I got it back the following day (6/22). 

When I got my car back, I noticed grease stains on the middle console. I have beige leather interiors, so it is extremely noticeable. I’m not the type to be as bothered by those things, and I saw it was only one spot at the time so I just decided to go home and clean it myself. As I was driving however, I realized there were grease stains all along my car door handle, seat, and steering wheel. This made me upset because I had just paid a huge sum of money, just to get my car back in this state. I do not expect it to be cleaner than when I dropped it off, but I certainly did not expect it to be dirtier. 

I called them, but they weren’t of much help. They just apologized and offered to clean it if I brought it in, but I didn’t want to bother taking my car back so I just told them I was calling to let them be aware of this and decided to clean it myself. 

A few days later (6/25), I was driving at night and realized my interior lights don’t work anymore. I had driven my car at night two days (6/19) before I brought it in to the shop, and I know the interior lights had been working because I had to turn on the lights to search for something I had dropped, along with using the light and mirror on my sun visor as well. My interior lights would also turn on when I opened the car door, etc. Now, the interior lights weren’t working, so I guessed that it had something to do with potential wiring from when they fixed my headlight.

At this point, I’m annoyed because of the amount that I had paid to get my car fixed, only to receive it back dirty, and now the interior lights aren’t even working. Am I wrong for thinking that they have poor quality control in their work? 

I called back AGAIN and let them be aware of the situation, and they told me to bring my car back in. They’re closed on the weekends, and I needed it for work that week so I brought it in the following Tuesday (7/5) because they were closed on Monday. The person that helped me, let’s call him Brian, said they would diagnose the problem and should have my car back before the end of the day. I didn’t receive a call back from them so I assumed it was just taking longer. 

The following day (7/6), I missed a call from them, seeing it at EOD after work, and the voicemail asked for me to call them back. I called back the next day (7/7) and spoke to someone else that told me they see my car is still in diagnostics. They don’t call me to update me for another few days, so I call back (7/11) and:
- Brian says he tried to call me and left a voicemail, but I told him I didn’t receive any calls. He asks me to verify my number in my account and reads it back to me and it’s not even my phone number ??? which is odd because how would they have texted and called me with updates prior to this? I’m annoyed with this because why would my phone number suddenly be messed up in their records…
- I’m also told that the electrician is not in until Monday of the following week.

Brian gives me the option of picking up my car because I told him I need my car for work, so I arrange to pick it up 7/13. When I pick it up, there are MORE grease stains in my car. Instead of calling them right away, I took pictures with the plan to bring it up when I bring my car in again get a call back on diagnostics. 

I bring my car back into the shop the morning of 7/20, and I’m not called back until 7/26 with updates on the diagnostics of my car. I see a cost of $480 to fix the interior light on the diagnostics report they sent me. Brian previously told me when I went to pick my car up, that he would waive the labor fees, but if they’re going to have to buy parts to fix what they broke, shouldn’t they have to pay for that as well? I asked this to clarify, and he told me he would have to charge me for the part because it is quite expensive. Like ??

I am annoyed and angry. It has been more than a MONTH since I first brought my car in, I received it back with grease stains everywhere, the interior lights that worked before not working after, had to go back and forth dropping it off because I needed it and they still hadn’t worked on it. Now, I still don’t have it back, and I’m being asked to pay almost $500 additionally to the $800 I paid prior. Does this make sense to you, especially after all this trouble + the fact that what is currently broken was working BEFORE I brought my car in? Am I in the right to refuse paying for it, but still have them fix it? I hate to be this person, but I’m seriously so tired and feel scammed. 

TLDR; I took my car in for maintenance + fixing headlight, was charged $800. Received it back dirty with grease stains everywhere, and a few days later found out my interior lights weren’t working (they worked fine before). I took my car back in, and after a series of inconvenient/annoying events, a month later, they are asking for $500 to fix the interior lights when they were fine before I brought my car in. Am I wrong for insisting they fix it and don’t charge me after all this trouble? 

Thanks!"

Chrysler Town&Country 3.3/125, 2008, pilot issues
Hi   folks, I have a problem with my remotes. Both fobs have trouble  locking  or unlocking the car. Both won't work at a distance larger than  about 5  feet. Both LOCK and UNLOCK button have to be clicked *several dozen times*   before it finally randomly works actually locking/unlocking. Usually   takes almost a minute of walking around the car and clicking the remote   over and over like a madman.

It   does not seem to matter where I stand with the remote: by the driver's   door, by the front, near the back, its complete random lottery whether   it will work or not. Some days they work flawlessly, others, takes   minutes of frustration to work.

Otherwise,   the central locking mechanism works: when in the car I can lock/unlock   the doors manually (using the buttons on the driver's door panel),  each  inidividually or all at once. On the rare occasion that the fob  works,  all the door lock/unlock immediately with no issue.

I   cleaned the fobs, replaced the batteries with brand new ones, and had   the fobs looked at by a professional, who assured me they work. I   removed and charged the car battery as well. There is a slight   improvement: now I ""only"" have to keep on clicking the remote buttons  for about 20  seconds, over and over, instead of a minute or two. Still,  annoying,  especially if you have load your kids/groceries etc.

The   only advice in the 2008 CH T&C manual is to reprogram the remotes,   but AFAIK they are programmed well, just can't ""get"" the signal to go   through? I also fear that mucking about with remotes programming while   they barely work, and can fail mid-procedure, might completely f- them   up.

My fobs are the type with only PANIC, LOCK, UNLOCK and 2X buttons on them.

Is it easy to recharge A/C system (2015 VW Passat)?
Today my wife got in her car and the A/C is no longer cooling. The only thing off the top of my head is that it could be low on freon. I am not 100% how the system works but I do know that the clutch won't engage if so. My biggest problem is that I am broke. My local shop wants 350 to charge the system. However my local auto parts store sells cans of it with a gauge for 40. I have a few questions;

Is there a way to check and see if that's whats wrong with it prior? Second is it fairly easy to do? looking around it seems there should be a port to screw it into, and you pretty much squeeze the trigger until it reads a certain PSI.  

Lastly can you actually find leaks? The car is sitting at 115k miles, so I am hoping it's a small leak and I can get by perhaps a few months until fall. Regardless due to $$$ I am willing to try anything.

Ongoing Problems with AC
My car AC keeps going out on me, and only blows hot air.  I took it to the dealership last week and they charged $700 to replace a hose and the condenser (apparently some of the parts were covered by warranty).  A week later, the problem recurred and now it's  the compressor, which will be about $1200-$1400 for parts and labor.

It just seems odd to me that these two things would go out in such rapid succession.  Am I getting screwed, or is this a  fairly normal price?"

Code P0731 on 2006 Nissan Altima
I'm wondering if someone has some knowledge on a problem with a 2006 Nissan Altima, 2.5L ?

It has 116,000 miles. The other day, on a fairly hot afternoon, while driving in the Phoenix area, the A/C stopped working.   The next morning, after driving a few blocks, it suddenly had no power, but would coast while in gear.  I coasted into a QT parking lot.  It would idle fine, and would rev while in park or neutral, but putting in gear it would not rev and wouldn't go forward.  However, it would backup slowly.  The Battery, Brake and Check Engine lights were on.  Reading the codes later that afternoon, it displayed only a P0731 code, which says ""Gear 1 Incorrect Ratio"".  It started fine and I let it run a couple minutes to see if it would throw any other codes, but it did not.  The A/C put out just hot air while it ran.  I shut it off after about 3 minutes (outside temp was about 108).  Checking the oil, it was full and fairly clean. Same for the transmission fluid.

It would only click when I went to start it again about 3 minutes later.  The battery is only 6 months old, but the cable ends are old and somewhat corroded.  So I took them loose, cleaned them, reattached them tight, then it started right up.   After towing the car to a shop, they say the Alternator is bad, and I'd have to replace that before they could further diagnose the P0731 transmission issue.  They said the battery was dead and they had to jump start it, but then the battery tested good.  However, I wonder how the alternator could be bad if the battery was still charged enough to start it at first in the afternoon before towing it. Then by just cleaning the cable ends and battery posts, it started right up again. Two days later, they said they had to jump it to start it.

I've already got a bit too much money into this car as I had to replace all 4 motor mounts in December to stop engine vibration, and it needed a new fuel pump.  (bought it used, fairly cheap and thought the vibration would be a cheap fix of just a motor mount or two, but it took all 4, and Nissan parts to work well.)    So my main questions are:

1. Could the alternator really be bad if the battery has been staying charged all along and just cleaning the cables made it start right up for me??  (the cable ends are old and SHOULD have been replaced when another shop replaced the battery 6 months ago.)
2. Could a bad alternator possibly cause a P0731 to be thrown?   And cause it to have no power while in gear?
3. For This Car... Is there a possible simple reason for this problem (P0731 and no drive power) that doesn't mean transmission problems?
4. Could the A/C stopping to put out cold air a few miles before the car lost power the next morning, have anything to do with this?
5. Could it maybe simply need new battery cables, since the battery tests good?  (I doubt it, but who knows)   When the old battery was weak it never stopped it from running or driving.
6. Lastly, shouldn't they be able to diagnose the transmission (P0731 code) if it's running, without having to replace the alternator first?

Thanks for any info anyone can provide.

2005 prius
firstly, my catalytic converter got stolen about a year ago (seriously like 3 weeks into having my car). but my dad put some temp piping underneath where the cat would be to get me through. since buying a new cat and getting it put in was and still is more than I can afford. but anyway, onto my current problem:


my car kept overheating. my dad and I did the normal things like checked and changed fluids. my oil definitely needed changing for sure, it was nearly black. and we started to realize that my issue seemed to be most related to my radiator.


note: my dad is an old car guy. he isn't a mechanic. but back in the day, he worked on old cars and flipped them to sell on ebay. but that was long ago. and he has too much pride to admit he is a bit frustrated and confused with my half engine half electric car. but he's been doing his best to work on it with me. so he'd know what to do if given pointers. just, seems to need a little help so here i am, asking.


we are going to replace the thermostat and water pump today. yay!


we have the radiator fully taken out of my car (during the take-out process we heard a gas release that we have found to be an ez-chill aka freon charge). we found two radiator looking vent things. we used some pressurized air to blow all the gunk out of the vents. 


now we are wondering these things:


• was it the front radiator that was charged with freon?


• do we need to burp it when we recharge the freon?


• does the freon cool something other than just normal cool air ac things?


• are there separate engine coolant reservoirs? 



any additional information, comments, questions are welcome.


///



I am 100% willing to send pictures and give any and all information needed to help me move forward with my car. I would love to get this fixed as best as I can before taking it to a shop.


thank you!"

2018 Kia Optima LX 2.4l AC issues
Ok so, my ac gradually got to where it only blew warm. I took it to a few places and was told my compressor was bad. The first guy charged me $40 for a diagnosis and he didn't even hook anything up to the compressor. He wanted to replace it and other things like the condenser etc. I decided not to trust it even tho he fixed my transmission issue for cheap when other places wanted more than triple just to tear it apart and charge me more once they found out what the problem was. I new what it was but they ""do thing the safe way to save hassle"" 

Anyway, I got my hands on a tool that allows for controlling the compressor independently of the system, basically turning the compressor on and off whenever I wanted. It didn't work at first but it showed good resistance. 

Eventually I took it to a mechanic who didn't tell me I needed a new compressor. He said it had no refrigerant in it but held pressure good. I told him I put a little refrigerant in to see if it made a difference (used a manifold gauge gauge and not the cheap ez-fix can at autozone). He said he wonder where it went. Maybe I didn't put it in correctly or it wasn't enough to make a difference but I didn't want to over charge so I left it. He said he could pull a vacuum and recharge it and see what happens. Costed like $125. I went ahead and did it since it was already hot. Well, it worked! But, it worked for that day and then worked very randomly for about a week then finally stopped blowing cold at all. 

I took it to him the very next day but it decided it wanted to blow cold. He said he couldn't do anything until it acted up again so drive around and bring it back when it stopped working again. I did and he said there was a code that he cleared making it blow cold. He said he thinks it was the pressure switch and I could use any cheap scanner tool to clear the code and make the ac work until he reached out to Kia for the part or whatever since they don't give out info on troubleshooting some things.

Finally he told me the cost would be almost $400 to replace the pressure switch he ""thinks"" is the problem. I thought that was to much for just thinking. Also, he told me the part was close to $300 but I checked on Rockauto and the part was barely 20 bucks. The most expensive one they had wasn't even $100. He wouldn't allow for me to bring my own part.

My question is, aren't these mechanics supposed to be able to pinpoint the issue? Shouldn't they be able to tell if the pressure switch or compressor control valve is the problem?  I know there is no leak because he said so and so did firestone who wanted to charge me $1900+. 

My car has a clutchless variable displacement compressor. I always thought it was the control valve that's kinda sticking out of the compressor. But I removed the valves connector and hooked my car battery directly to the valve and can hear it click. But this was before I found out there was no refrigerant so of course it didn't get me a cold ac. So I switched the battery wires around on the control valve just in case and that made no difference. I do think I heard a louder click the first time I switched the wired around on the valve. Maybe I messed something up and thats why after the refrigerant recharge it blew cold sometimes and randomly stopped? That's why I think it's the valve. 

After the refrigerant recharge it would blow cold for hours and then suddenly stop. Sometimes it would be working and I'll turn it off and right back on and it wouldn't work. One time it wasn't working but I forgot to turn it off and eventually I felt it blowing cold like 30 minutes later. 

Does this sound like the pressure switch or something else. That tool used, which I borrowed and no longer have, would turn the compressor on every single time but I noticed a few times the tool reset to where it would turn off but I could turn it right back on and get cold air whenever I did so I kinda ruled out the compressor. 

The pressure switch shows no voltage across 3 pins. Someone suggested I try and jump the pressure switch by putting alligator clips on the pins then he realized there were 3 pins and said to put foil across the pins. That didn't do anything and is questionable to me but he's a pilot and was a airplane pilot for 30 or so years and knows a lot vs me who only learns from having troubleshoot/fix my own car, if I can that is.

Can I go to a mechanic and have them specifically check those two components? Seems like they always want to diagnose and pull vacuums but if I already did that at two different places I would think so. But I kinda know how the game goes, I guess. 😭

Here is a screenshot of what a scan device shows me. Not much but maybe it'll make it easier to help, if anyone hear can.

https://ibb.co/YD74Vpy

One other question I had is, if I decided I wanted to attempt to replace the pressure switch myself is there a way to recycle/reuse the refrigerant I have. Hate to have a shop empty it after I just paid for a full recharge. Or even if I wanted to replace the compressor control valve if the pressure switch wasn't the issue? 

Sorry for such long post but I just wanted to provide as much info as I could to better help someone that might be able to help me. 

Thanks!"

Need advice: Keep having to go back to Firestone for AC repair
Hello everyone,

Ok so for some context: a year ago my AC in my car was not working at all, cold air was not blowing or the fan wouldn’t blow at full power/ would completely turn off.

March 2022: I take it into Firestone, tell them all my issues, they perform a diagnostic and they tell me my compressor isn’t working. Being the layman I am, I hesitantly agreed to the $1400 job.

May 2022: Cold air is blowing but I’m still having issues with the fan blowing and I try to convey this to Firestone and after they check it again and after waiting for 2 hours they tell me that the “charging port was loose and leaking” so they fixed it and refilled my refigerant for free. Cool.

June 2022: still having issues with the fan. Seems to be worse the hotter it gets.

In all, I don’t feel like im getting screwed over necessarily but it’s not like my fan failing to blow effectively is a new problem. I’ve told them about it and they never mentioned it. If anything I’m more upset by the time I have to waste to keep going back and fixing it. 

Do I have to bite the bullet and pay full price for the repairs or would I be justified in trying to negotiate a price reduction or not paying at all. (If repairs/replacements are still needed) 

Just in case regional laws might apply, I received this work in Diamond Bar, Ca."

[Update 2] 2013 Dodge Grand Caravan dies on same hilly road, doesnt turn on again, no error codes. 20 minutes later starts up no problem. Help?
Original Update thread:[https://www.reddit.com/r/autorepair/comments/u9esrb/update\_2013\_dodge\_grand\_caravan\_dies\_on\_same](https://www.reddit.com/r/autorepair/comments/u9esrb/update_2013_dodge_grand_caravan_dies_on_same/)/

TLDR: 2013 Dodge Grand Caravan stalls out minutes after a fill up when accelerating up an incline. 3 separate mechanics can't replicate, but I think I'm narrowing the exact parameters to recreate.

So took my car to a third mechanic with a full tank of gas, left it overnight and they couldn't replicate the issue for 2 days. Gave it back with a giant shrug and an apology (no charge thankfully). I've never seen my wife want to chuck a car out a window before, but here we are.

So yesterday my car died going 65 miles per hour on the highway as I accelerated up a few hundred yard incline (literally going up/over an overpass). I had just filled up 10 minutes prior with 6 gallons of gas to put the tank only 1/2 full. Once again, no sputtering or jerking, temp was reading normal, no check engine light prior to shut off; it just shuts off the engine. This time however, it turned on again after 5 minutes of sitting in 90F weather.

Unfortunately we were stuck on the side of I-55 so there was too much road noise to try to hear for the fuel pump or any other significant noises (as recommended in the previous thread).

Double unfortunately, filling the tank 1/2 way and not completely full didn't seem to change matters. What is interesting is that I previously filled the tank with 10 gallons (3/4 full) and didn't seem to have the problem. Of course, I don't have hard evidence as to whether we drove it up/down hills immediately after fill up.

Using basic correlation, here's the most common things I've noticed in this saga:

1. The first time it stalled out was the same gas station (MotoMart) we used during this latest stall out (may just be coincidence of course since it has stalled out with fuel from other stations too). EDIT: Just checked, the third stall out was with a completely different brand of fuel (Mobil).
2. The first, third, and fourth (latest) times it stalled out was within 10-20 minutes of fill up. However the second stall out was the same gas tank as the first stall out, just 3 days later.
3. Weather doesn't seem to be the main factor as it stalled out both in mild 50F days and 90F days.
4. A load was required as all the times it has stalled out has had at least 3+ people worth of weight. None of the mechanics (dealer included) tested with a load.

Help me obi-wan repairmen, you're my only hope."

How do I push back on an Auto Repair mechanic?
I have a diesel truck for my business.  It stopped running and we had it towed to a repair shop.

By the time that they finally got around to looking at it, they told me that they would need to charge me to disassemble the engine to find out what was wrong.  I gave the go ahead.  The cost was about $500.

They came back and told me that they found the problem (Remove/Replace the Turbo Charger and Breather Assembly).  The estimate was $5500.  We need the truck, so I approved the fix.

Now they say that they air compressor locked up and broke the teeth off of the air compressor gear.  They have to remove the front cover and replace the gear.  They want to charge another $6000.

All said and done, I am at over $14,000.  

How legit is this?  They give an estimate for one thing and then claim it is something else and then something else.  They slowly squeeze money out of me.  What can I do?"

Voltage problems, what is it?
Having a problem with my teen's car (which was formerly my commuter car). 2005 Hyundai Elantra. After driving for a while, the battery/charge light is coming on. Here's what we know:

Battery at rest shows just above 12 volts.

Car starts fine. Battery now reads just above 14 volts at idle.

We drive the car for a while. After 30 or 40 minutes, the battery light comes on.

Park the car, and pop the hood with the car still running. Now we read 11 volts.

Turn off the car. Back to the normal resting voltage just above 12 volts.

So it seems like we have a voltage drop, but only after a while, so it may relate to the alternator or some other electrical system. My teen reports that he may have left the AC light on, even though he had warm air blowing, and I guess that's a high draw system...

Any thoughts?"

2021 Skoda Octavia 4 RS (2.0 tsi) - weird noise during specific turns
Octavia 4 RS - 2021, 2.0 TSI, 180kw. Car's done almost 80,000km. I'm the 2nd owner, bought it 6 weeks ago and just noticed this.

So far I've done wheel alignment. Changed oil in diff, trans. Replaced front suspension arms and bushings, done wheel alignment again.

I regularly do 300km trips on bendy roads just fine with no weird noises but close to my home there are these two apparently VERY specific turns where the car makes this sound almost every time. It's always a sharp left turn at the end of a town (=accelerating). So when all the weight shifts to the right side of the car. I am able to somewhat reliably replicate this by quickly turning the steering wheel right-left by about 90 degrees while moving, so again causing weight to rapidly shift to one side.

At first I thought it sounded like shifting without applying clutch properly but it's DSG and it happens in manual mode as well when the car is NOT shifting gears. It sounds like some rotating part touching something else, usually the sound is a much ""shorter"" burst but this time I managed to capture it more pronounced and hopefully easier to identify for someone who's had to deal with this before.

19 inch wheels but I couldn't find any sign of rubbing (and it doesn't really sound like that either to me).

  
Last thing that comes to mind is transmission mount/bushing/whatever you call it but I'd like to not replace 25 expensive parts just for it to be caused by the 26th if at all possible :)"

2007 F-550 6.8L PCM 7C3A-12A650-DSC Failure – Need Replacement & Advice”
Hey everyone, I'm looking for some guidance on a PCM issue with my 2007 Ford F-550 6.8L V10. The original ECM/PCM (part number 7C3A-12A650-DSC) was previously diagnosed as ""fried,"" but I had to reinstall it temporarily. When I start the truck, it runs fine for about 8 minutes, then suddenly throws 30+ codes and shuts off. After that, it won't restart properly. I've verified that it's the exact part needed, but I can't find a replacement anywhere — it's been discontinued, and most suppliers are either out of stock or have different suffixes (like DEC, DDC, etc.). I'm open to new, used, or remanufactured as long as it's the exact DSC version. Has anyone dealt with this specific issue or know where I can source a reliable unit? Also, does this sound like a classic internal ECM failure, or should I be checking something else (like voltage, grounds, PATS)? Any help is appreciated!"

Re: German cars vs Korean cars (repair differences)
I have an Audi Q5 which is almost 10 years old, with the 3.0 liter engine which is amazing. I use it for a lot of highway driving. Now I’m starting to look at something newer, I automatically am attracted to the Audi SQ5 because of the upgraded engine (you can’t get it with the Q5 anymore). A few people have told me that the Kia GV70 with a 3.5 L engine should be on my list to compare. 

I wanted to ask the men and women who work on these cars, would you rather work on Audi or on Kia? Preferably, the Audi SQ5 and the GV 70  3.5l, but I realize that not many people who have experience with both of these cars. I would think that one is more difficult to repair, one is easier, and there’s probably a price difference in the repairs and a reliability difference as well. Looking forward to your thoughts (I’ve had just about zero problems with my Audi Q5). Thank you."

Does my car need major repair?
2019 Honda CR-V 1.5T 100k miles

Check engine light blinking after it lost power while hard accelerating. Shut down for 10 minutes and restarted without blinking so drove home slowly instead of towing. Not the first time as it used to shut down before which were diagnosed as faulty spark plugs. It ran well for few months but acting up again... worried it's a major problem now. Might be renting a car cause I don't feel safe driving this car. The infosystem is also acting up, blinking, bleeping and turning black. 

  
The funny part is I was planning to buy a MB GLC but my dad talked me into buying Honda cause they are so reliable he said.

Chevy Cruze 2013 hard to diagnose problem
I have a Chevy Cruze LT 2013 with 107k miles on, with a problem that has been very hard to recreate at a shop and impossible to diagnose so far.

The car runs generally well, but occasionally the RPMs won't go above \~2000 RPM for several seconds at a time, which limits the power regardless of the throttle.

Also, the engine light comes on periodically (generally when the symptom above is particularly bad or last for longer) with a code for a knock sensor issue (which I replaced with a new one).

There is also sometimes, also randomly, a distinctive ticking noise coming from the engine synchronized with the RPMs that can last for several minutes. The two symptoms don't necessarily happen at the same time.

I took the car to several mechanics and have spent \~$2000 so far on diagnostic and replacement of various components, with no result.

It was suggested that there is some engine noise that triggers the knock sensor to limit the engine power, supposedly to avoid damage due to what it thinks are detonations, but nobody was able to pinpoint a specific noise causing it.

Some suggested going deeper into the engine the but that would cost quite a bit and with no guarantee that they would be able to fix the problems or even identify the cause.

The car is not worth much, but I'm happy with it: it is relatively quiet, has a lot of leg room, has been quite reliable since I bought it (new), and very importantly, I would like to avoid the hassle of getting another car.

In conclusion, I'd like to fix these issues, as, even if the car is fully drivable, I don't know if they could cause more severe damage to the engine. But I don't want to continue sinking money into it with no result.

So that's my dilemma: should I continue to try to fix it, or just give up and drive it for as long as it lasts?

BTW, would using a OBD2 scanner to monitor the engine in real time while driving, help with the diagnosis? I could then read the various parameter values at the time the issue was happening.

UPDATE: I took the car in to a local mechanic who, when he heard the engine ticking noise, immediately stated that the all the symptoms above were caused by one or more defective or worn out hydraulic lifters, and that changing them would fix the problem. Which I did, and now the engine runs and sounds normal. While he worked on the lifters, he also looked at the timing chain, and said that it was ok, no need to replace it."

Help with water pump on 2018 Chevy Silverado.
2018 Chevy Silverado 1500 LT  140,000 miles
I'm reaching out to see if anyone has dealt with this same situation—or has a lead on a solution.

I own a 2018 Chevy Silverado 1500 LT with the E-Assist package (mild hybrid), and I'm facing a serious problem: the water pump for this specific model is no longer made.

I have a liaison with General Motors who confirmed that GM discontinued manufacturing this specific water pump in 2023, and there is currently no replacement part being produced.

Here’s what I’ve tried so far:

Sent the original pump to a water pump company in Paso Robles, California, but they said they could not rebuild it.

Took it to a rebuilder here in Fort Worth, and he also said it wasn’t rebuildable.

Hired a parts locator to try and find a replacement—he did the search and ended up not charging me because he couldn’t locate one anywhere.

The truck has been in the shop since September.

Back in January, someone suggested trying to grind down a couple of ribs and fit the old pulley onto a standard water pump as a workaround, but that’s not ideal and doesn’t seem reliable long-term.

I’ve also tried LKQ and Summit Racing—neither has the part or a workable alternative.

Help Diagnose 2018 Dodge Caravan Slider Door Issue
The passenger-side sliding door on my 2018 Dodge Caravan often (not always) won't close automatically when using the remote fob or the pillar button—only once it's fully open.   
  
The same door reliably opens automatically with the fob. I can also reverse the door's automated movement direction from opening to closing by pressing the fob button again before the door has reached the fully open position. So it seems like the door motor is operational in both directions.  
  
If fully open, the door makes no sound—no actuator clicks or grinding noises that would suggest a jam when I try either button (fob or pillar) to close the door."

How much will it cost fix a Jaguar E type 2+2 Coupe?
I want to preface by saying that the money is not an issue when it comes to this project. My goal is to pay someone to swap out the inner parts of Jaguar E type 2+2 Coupe for the modern ones. I do not care if the car is going to lose its soul if I replace the parts of it for the modern ones. Since I do not understand anything about cars, I was wondering what has to be replaced in order for the car to be reliable. It doesn't have to fancy or powerful stuff, I'm looking for the most basic affordable option.  I've done a little bit of research and stumbled across this [websiste](http://brokenkitty.com/xke/xke12.htm) , it talks about swapping the engine for the chevy V8 one. I've also talked a bit about it to my friend and he said something along the lines of swapping out the drivetrain and the electrical harness. Can someone tell me if what he said is correct? I was wondering how much it would cost to swap out those two things. When it comes to the drive train and the electrical harness, do I have to buy them from a third party and then pay someone to install it, or can a repair shop source it from somewhere? Also, how do I know which electrical harness and drivetrain to purchase? Lastly, do I need to replace or swap out anything else?

P.S Since I have a limited knowledge of cars and engineering, I feel frustrated because I don't know how and where to start my journey of fixing the jaguar e type. I don't know who to call or ask questions or who can repair it. (I live in Los Angeles) I'm wondering if this task can be completed by any mechanic or it has to be a specialized shop.( If it's a specialized shop, how are those shops called?) Can someone write out what should I do step by step on how I should approach this task. I don't know where to begin, who to call or who to approach."

2009 Hyundai Santa Fe – Starting Issues (Sentimental Vehicle, Hoping to Save for My Son)
Hey all,
I know this is an older SUV, but I wanted to share a bit of the backstory before diving into the issue.

This 2009 Hyundai Santa Fe belonged to my dad, who recently passed away. It means a lot to my family, and we’re hoping to keep it around long enough to pass it on to my oldest son (he’s 14 now). In the meantime, I’m driving it to work a few times a week to keep it running.

Here’s the issue:
Every morning, the car struggles to start. I have to jam on the gas as soon as it turns over, or it will stall out. Once it's running, it drives great — smooth, reliable, no stalling, no weird noises, etc. Also after drinking it a bit and the engine heats up it seems to start a bit better, still struggles a bit but easier then when it's cold.

So far, we’ve:

Replaced the battery

Spent around $1,800 fixing a CEL issue — the mechanic said they had to “smoke the system” and found a broken hose. That got the CEL cleared and the car running better overall, but the cold start issue persists.


It has about 171k miles on it. I don’t mind putting a little more money into it to keep it going — I just want to be smart about what I fix next.

Any ideas on what could be causing this hard starting problem? I’ve read a bit about fuel pressure regulators, idle air control valves, MAF sensors, etc., but I’d love some advice from people more experienced with these kinds of issues.

Thanks in advance — this car means more than just transportation right now."

HELP! 2014 AUDI REPAIR QUESTIONS
# Please someone help!! I bought a 2014 Audi Q5 in Oct '23 from a used car lot. It had 100,000 miles on it but I was desperate & needed something reliable to keep my job & travel for work. I also purchased a 2 yr, 24,000-mile standard extended warranty ($3,500 extra). Car has been losing oil for about 6 months. I've gotten two regular scheduled oil changes since I've had the car to maintain regular service. The engine light has been on since purchase, (told it was just a sensor). About 3 1/2 wks ago, I noticed the coolant leaking. and the brakes grinding a bit. On March 18th (16 days ago) the hose for the coolant popped. I saw exactly where it was coming from (front left side). Lonnng story short, I figured the best place for repairs would be an Audi dealership for the quality & convenience of specific parts. I had the car towed in as to not cause further damage, but the car was still running. I drove it up onto the flatbed. Dropped my car off on March 19th & got a loaner from Audi Meadowlands (NJ). They called me 10 days later to tell me that I would have to pay $900 for them to just clean the engine bay due to spewed oil. I got over the initial anger that the car had sat for 10 days without anyone even looking at it and then was told that they hadn't gotten around to the cleaning of the engine bay yet AND, that the cost for cleaning is NOT included in the diagnostic part of the job. And they couldn't even check what is wrong with the car until they cleaned the area enough to diagnose. (i screamed, yelled & moaned but finally agreed as long as they did the diagnostics and contacted my warranty company BEFORE anything was actually done. I just received a voicemail last night (15 days after dropping the car) that nothing has been done yet including the cleaning of the bay still. (I had stated that I knew I needed brake pads, probably a hose connecting the coolant flow to just next to the thermostat or water pump, and obviously a hose, gaskets, etc for the oil leak. So now the service company said nothing was done AND now they want me to pay for the coolant hose and the cleaning in order to diagnostically check the engine. According to them, unless they clean and put all these non-covered parts on, they can't even tell me if the car is fixable. My problem is this, it is a 2014. I financed the car because I am like most people living paycheck to paycheck, so I still owe about $10,000 for the car. The Kelly blue book value is about $7,500. Now they want me to put out $1,700 just to clean under the hood, connect a new coolant hose and drop some oil in it, to see if anything is fixable! According to them, they can't diagnose the car unless its running and now somehow the car isn't able to turn on without the hoses etc being installed. (even though i drove the car onto the truck). If the cost of repairs is more than the worth of the car, I don't feel I should put any money into it. I took GAP insurance just in case (past experiences knowledge). So, my bottom-line question is this...Is it normal to put almost $2,000 out of pocket for cleaning an engine bay and putting a hose on, only to probably be told later that it will cost another $3-$5,000 of uncovered parts to fix? I literally offered to come to the shop with a case of brake fluid to clean the bay myself! $900 just to have someone spray cleaner on the interior bay, pisses me off but I don't have a lift or garage and I am in no way financially able to put out $2,000 just to be told, oh well you are S>O>L. If this car isn't fixable, than I am out $2,000 which I could have put towards a new used car. And BTW, I will have to take out a payday loan just to pay that! So either way, I am going to be in more debt but I am trying to limit how much future debt I will have. Please help! My brother who was a mechanic for 40+ yrs of his life just passed away 3 months ago & I really have no one I trust to ask. Thank you for your time."

2020 VW Atlas - strange noise
It’s an Atlas crosssport turbo 4. Fairly reliable car for a while now. Leaving the neighborhood to take my son to school. Raining so streets are wet. Traffic so I have to get on the throttle to engage the turbo, wheels spin and revs go nearly to redline, close to 6K, but briefly. Now on the drive home I notice a noise that kinda matches the engine RPM. Best I can describe it is like a plastic fan hitting or brushing the fan housing. In the driveway I set and throttled to 2000 and it follows the RPM but when it drops back to idle it stops briefly and then starts again after a second or two.

Tell me this isn’t something severe 😒"

[Hyundai i30 Stationwagon 2014] Can't open trunk

Hey everyone,

the trunk on my 2014 Hyundai i30 does not open anymore. Only the manual release from inside works reliably.  
When i push the button to open nothing happens but sometimes a relay clicks somewhere in the rear hatch, even when the button is not pressed.  
The rear hatch sometimes slightly opens randomly (it's not fully shut, it kinda wiggles back and forth while driving), but does not fully open, so the lock is still somehow keeping it shut.

Now I'm not sure where the core issue lies, is it the lock, the button to open, the wiring or a combination of several parts?

I'd appreciate any help or pointers on how to best diagnose & fix this."

Blown head gasket?
I bought a Renault Clio three months ago. The car just passed its MOT, but I noticed brown foam on the oil cap.

I did some research and found that this could be caused by a blown head gasket or by driving short distances.

I live 16 km (10 miles) from work.

Is this something I should be worried about? The car cost me €2,500, and I’ve already spent €1,200 on repairs to make it a reliable vehicle. If there is an issue with the head gasket, I will sell the car because I can’t afford more repairs in such a short time."

Honda Accord Door Repair Cost

Hi everyone,

I noticed some damage on the side of my Honda Accord’s door (photo attached in comments). It looks like a crack/scratch near the edge of the door trim. Does anyone have an idea how much it might cost to repair this?

I’m wondering if it’s something that can be fixed with touch-up paint and minor dent repair or if it might require replacing the trim/panel. Any recommendations for reliable repair shops or insights on pricing would be super helpful!"

How fucked am I
Bought a 2016 Honda Civic LX from a user car dealership “clean title” for what I thought was a good deal, $9k, but there’s definitely some fishy shit going on lol. The main issues seem electrical ?
Such as: The windshield wiper fluid dispenses everytime I turn the car on, the wiper blades go from working fine to barely working (lagging), I turned on auto headlights earlier today and it kept making a beeping(?) sound within the car, the driver side headlight sometimes work sometimes doesn’t, and currently I just ran into the problem of the AC only coming on when the headlights turn off.
So please tell me how fucked I am lol is this an easy fix? I don’t know shit about cars. I’m so upset because I just needed a good reliable car as I’m leaving for university soon. The car came with no warranty. Help :(

Edit: Looked under the drivers seat and found a good deal of rust. This was near Hurricane Helene so I’m presuming this is a flood car. Bought last month in Eastern KY. How do I even proceed??"

Is my clutch or my gearbox the problem here?
6 speed manual transmission Skoda Yeti, 2014, petrol engine (I think 1.2L?)

I just had the car serviced two days ago, and I drove it that day and yesterday and it was completely fine, even started up faster than usual. 

This morning, however, I started it just fine but it struggled to get into first gear. It felt like it slipped back into neutral, but I'm not sure. The gear stick moved the way it normally does but the car made some strange sounds (almost like I wasn't revving high enough, but I was revving the way I always do when I come out of my driveway). 

Getting into second was fine, but when I moved to third it felt like it slipped and I put the clutch in and went to neutral before putting it back in third, it still felt wrong. 

It seemed a little iffy in first at the next corner, but then it was fine until I put it in sixth, when it clunked (it felt like something dropped under the centre console). 

Sixth gear has always been the smoothest and most reliable gear in this car. I don't understand what caused this sudden change. 

It was fine the rest of the way to work, but then I was driving very carefully and over revving at every change. "

2007 Ford F150 making a knocking sound near engine with vibrations after extended driving
To preface, I am completely clueless when it comes to cars. I am a new driver and have never taken the opportunity to learn. That's on me.

That being said, we just returned from a four hour drive from the next state over, and on the last leg of our drive, the truck started vibrating significantly when idling, with a noticeable knocking sound coming from under the hood. I thought it only happened when I turned then stopped, but I just noticed that it still happened when I went straight.

It stops for a short time when I turn the truck off and start up again, but begins again shortly after starting and driving. Is it overheating? If it is, what should I do? If it's not... I guess what should I do?

Also, I'm not sure if allowed, but does anyone know how much this would cost to fix? I'm very low on money and need to make arrangements to figure out how to come up with the money to fix. TIA

Btw my mileage is about 167,000. She's been real reliable."

Quote for a Fix - Reasonable?
I recently brought my Hyundai 2016 to a dealership for maintenance after a mechanic I was working with was unable to determine why it shut off randomly while driving. While at the mechanic, they surfaced no pressing issues as well that would require an immediate fix.

However, due to being unable to determine why the car shut off randomly, I decided to take the car into Hyundai servicing.

I received a quote from the maintenance team at Hyundai and I want to know if it's legitimate/reasonable, and if there are certain things I should forego?

Here is the summary:
Crankshaft Sensor $580.03
Motor Mount: EXCESSIVE ENGINE VIBRATION: $667.77
Transmission Mounts: EXCESSIVE ENGINE VIBRATION: $586.55
Transmission Flush: $329.95
Cooling System Service (Drain & Refill): $209.95
Timing Cover Gasket: $1,382.45
Axle Replace - Front: BOTH: $1,414.42
Cabin Air Filter Replacement: $89.95
Wiper Blade Replacement - Front: $109.95
Oil Change"" $51.26

The car has been quite reliable to me the past few years with 92k miles, and would prefer to keep it longer rather than purchasing a new vehicle.

Do the above recommendations make sense for repairs?

Edit: Thank you for the guidance received, just check that everything is covered under my warranty =)"

Would like some advice on how to move forward with my 2003 Toyota Tacoma.
Hello everyone. My first time posting on this sub. I am looking to take my next step in investing in a vehicle. At the moment i drive a red 2003 4 door Toyota tacoma. A little background on the truck:  

ive owned it since 2017. 233k miles on it. The original engine blew up at about 198k miles after which i found a cheap junkyard engine to replace it with for about 1500$. The engine has worked decently well but recently i had it overheat on me. To which my mechanic told me it was a blown head gasket. I have managed to prevent it from overheating again by using a product called Barr’s radiator stop leak. Which has worked but its putting a bandaid on the problem. On top of this i had to spend about 4000 $ on fixing the front end parts less than a year ago so i just invested a lot of money into it.

Now. I currently work construction so the truck is very useful to me. I dont plan on doing that for work forever but i do projects around the house quite often so the truck proves instrumental in that endeavor.

Recently i have been looking into the VW golf As a newer,  more reliable piece of transportation. Looking to get one with a manual tranny because its more fun and i want to find one for a lower price. 

Now my dilemma is that i am not sure what is the more sound decision. The way i see it i have 3 choices:

1. Invest in a newer possibly rebuilt engine for my truck and keep it for another 15 or so years

2. Sell my truck and buy the Golf (im leaning away from this one currently because this would leave me without a rugged vehicle to transport dirty tools/ materials 

3. Keep my truck pretty much  the way it is and buy A  VW Golf and i would have two cars. The only real downside for this is it will be very expensive to upkeep/maintain two cars i could afford the upfront cost.

Im just not sure what the best decision is. 

The reason i am leaning toward keeping the truck is because it is in very high demand. Everybody seems to love these toyota trucks including me. When the engine blew up for the first time. I had my tow truck driver and my mechanic immediately offer to buy it from me. Even had a family member offer to buy it. So i am afraid that i would be giving away something that is very sought after.

Sorry if this post is all over the place. any input/advice anyone would have for me would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks and good day to you all!"

2006 Toyota Tundra randomly stalling
So, my stepdad has a 2006 Toyota Tundra with the 4.7 L V8 engine and 181k miles. For awhile, it’s been running fine. However, about a month ago, it started running improperly. So, if the engine is started cold, it always starts just fine. However, if you start it while the engine is hot, it will sometimes stall immediately after. For awhile, if you started it again afterwards, it would stay on and work fine. However, recently, it got worse, to where, you restart it, then it immediately dies again, restart again, dies again, rinse and repeat. It literally sometimes takes revving the engine with the truck in neutral right as it starts to keep the engine on long enough to move. However, starting it from parked isn’t the only time where this happens. It can come up to, say, a red light, and it runs just fine when you stop, but then, out of nowhere, the engine stalls while you’re stopped. This is especially annoying because the starter is disabled unless it’s in either park or neutral. So, I have to shift from drive to neutral, restart the engine, then shift back into drive. Since it’s triggering a check engine light, I used my OBD-II scanner to see if it gave anything that would be helpful in figuring out the problem. It gave 2 MAF sensor codes and a brake pedal position sensor code. So, I’ve tried several things to fix this, but so far, none of them have worked. Here’s what I’ve tried:

-Cleaned out the carbon deposits in the throttle body
-Run engine with MAF sensor disconnected
-Replaced MAF sensor
-Replaced spark plugs 

My stepdad personally thinks it’s a fuel system problem. From how it feels for him, it’s like the fuel just quit being injected. It could be a failing fuel pump, clogged fuel filter, or dirty fuel injectors. What we’re going to try next is running a fuel system cleaner through it to see if that does anything. For now, I’m wanting to know what you think it might be. Any help would be greatly appreciated, because we need this truck to work reliably, and at this point, it’s become too unreliable to be considered usable. Thanks. "

Dodge Charger VS Chrysler 200
I’m having a hard time deciding on what to do. There is pros and cons to each one.
Need some help!

I own a 2015 Dodge Charger SXT (Mt first car and still love it) and have had it for roughly 8 years now. Few fender benders, no major accidents but there is small damages here and there. Including the hood, grill, dents on each side, passenger door can’t open all the way because someone hit it and other problems. (Including stalling, losing speed, it’ll lock up on the freeway and only go a certain speed 45 roughly, constantly shaking and jolting when in idle). It has about 140,000 miles on it and needs some work. Still runs with issues here and there. Pretty sure I have an oil leak too. 

On the other hand, my parents gave me their car that is paid off. 2015 Dodge Chrysler 200 that has 70,000 miles and in very good condition. 

My problem is figuring out if I wanted to sell the Chrysler and I can get around 10-12k and use that money to invest in fixing up my Dodge Charger. They discontinued them so I also wanted to keep it for that reason. Hopefully it’ll cost about half what I would make back from the Chrysler. 

Or my other options is  fixing the Dodge Charger and selling that for less and getting maybe half of that money back. 

I see no point in having two cars because it’s only me. I’m trying to see how much money I can get back to help me get back on my feet. 

Do I get rid of my favorite car, the Dodge Charger for a more reliable car that has half the mileage, or Do I keep the Chrysler and put the minimal work in to fix that Dodge and sell it for what I can get back from it. Please help me decide. "

Cut my Losses or Pay For Repairs?
I recently purchased a used 2008 Lexus RX 400h for 5,300$. It had about 190,000 miles on it. I knew there would be problems with it considering the price and I decided that the cost of repairs was worth it since I’ve heard that Lexuses are reliable and last a long time.

So I spent about 4,000$ on various repairs (control arm, struts, radiator, new tires). I also spent 500$ on apple CarPlay and 300$ on new speakers. 

It was fine for a few months, now I need a new catalytic converter bank and inverter coolant pump, the costs of these repairs is about 2,000$. If I go through with the repairs, I’ll have spent more on the car in three months than it is worth. If I sell the car, I definitely won’t get back what I invested.

I can pay for these repairs, but I’m worried more things like this will come up over the upcoming months/years and I’ll keep dumping money into something that won’t last long anyway. 

- Should I pay for the repairs and hope the car will last?
- Or cut my losses, sell it, and get a new car?"

Help with handling a dealership service center
I bought a 2021 Mitsubishi Outlander Sport from the dealership a little over a month ago. I purchased a warranty for servicing the car for 48,000 miles. I took it in for a oil change and the dealership left my air filter open. When I went to drive off, the car was way louder. I took it back and they told me to drive it for 2 days and see if it still makes the loud noise. I drove it to my dad he opened it up, the air filter was placed backwards and they left parts floating in the box and the box opened. This was 3 weeks ago. Now today, I brought my car to their service center 2 days ago to run diagnostics on a service engine light that came on and my car began to shake. They told me they can't find anything wrong with it because it keeps going on and off, and I need to drive it until it happens again. I feel like this is not right and their soloution is to just drive it until something changes. It's making me upset because I purchased a newer car to have something reliable. So i'm looking for advice or what would you do in this situation."

Wrong Oil Filter installed by Dealership Service Center
On Thursday I had an oil change on my 2015 Mazda CX-9 at a dealership service center. My vehicle had 183,170 miles. They put the wrong oil filter on. Later that day, as I was reaching the peak of an incline, my car started loosing acceleration and I noticed a lot of smoke in my rearview mirror. I immediately put on my hazards and tried to pull over. By the time I reached a safe spot on the busy highway, I could hear knocking in my engine. The oil was actively leaking from the bottom of my car. 

I was able to tow it to a different Mazda service center and they verified that the wrong oil filter had been put on my car. The one they put on was much too small. They did an inspection and replaced 6 quarts of oil and put on the proper oil filter. The engine isn't currently knocking. They commented ""not sure how much damage to internal parts of engine without teardown and insp.""

I have had NO engine issues with this vehicle. She has been very reliable and I have always stayed on top of my oil changes. 

What would you do? What should I be looking for as far as damages?"

Should we sell our Honda Odyssey/Lexus RX350 to get a BMW X3 from a relative?
EDIT: Yup, Odyssey has PAX tires and it looks like I have a bunch of reading to do about de-PAXing. Seems like the overwhelming advice is to avoid the BMW *and* continue with current cars for as long as they run reliably.

***

Older relative's car they are offering to us for $5000:

**BMW X3** - ~10 years old; ~60K miles (age/miles could be off but not by much)

Don't think the car has been in any (major) accidents and AFAIK the relative's husband is really into cars so I'd trust that the car has been maintained well for as long as they've had it.

***
# Current cars:

1. **2006 (not 2007) Honda Odyssey Touring w/PAX tires** - 144K miles - will need new tires soon (apparently this model has REALLY expensive tires/system and it'll likely take $2000+ for new tires!!)

This is a car that the same relative sold to us many years ago. It has had some fixes done in recent years (new engine mounts + new brakes in 2020; power steering repair in 2022; new battery in 2023; AC related work - coolant and filters - in 2024) but it seems reliable otherwise.

2. **2008 Lexus RX350** - 180K miles - doesn't seem like it needs any major repairs soon, but it's getting up there in terms of age/miles.

***
#Questions:

1. Is the BMW X3 repairable and are its parts/labor affordable and have short wait times if they need to be ordered? 

2. Which of our current cars should we sell first? (current thought is Lexus because it has more miles + we need a van for roadtrips)

3. **What would you do in our position? Is $5000 a good deal for the BMW X3 especially if it is as repairable as the Lexus and if its parts are as affordable as the Lexus'?**

97 Rav4 - took a break, now won't start.
I have a 1997 Toyota Rav 4.  I'd had some issues with it leaking rain into the interior and getting moldy, which led to me not driving it for a while. Maybe 2 months. I went out to start it and the battery was dead. I had it tested, bad battery, got a new one. 

Now it won't start. Before this hiatus, it started perfectly every time, quite reliable. 

When I turn the key everything lights up and it makes the sound like it's trying to start... RrrrRRrrrrRRrrrrRRrrr, but it never fires up. I tried pumping the gas a lot before I tried again, didn't work. I'm afraid if keep trying to start it too much the battery will go dead and I'll be stuck again. 

It seems clear to me that it's related to me not driving it for a while, and seems like it should be something simple because of that, but I don't know how to troubleshoot or figure it out.  Fuel lines? Sparkplugs? Any tips on things I can try?  If I have to get it towed I imagine the mechanic would have a simple answer and I'd feel dumb. "

I drive a 2012 vw jetta- it has a lot of symptoms and I don’t know where to start
Okay so go easy on me here- I’m not a regular reddit poster and don’t know much about cars or maintenance but I’m trying to learn! I’ve just always been suspect of slummy mechanics lol. 

So for a while now my car has had problems with stalling (idk if that’s the correct word). It usually happens while I’m idling (it has also happened while driving at normal speeds a couple times). What happens is it’s like the engine turns off, it flashes the battery light on the dash along with the check engine light. I know when it’s about to do this bc it feels like the engine is having tremors or sputtering- I can feel it through the seat and the whole car will move a bit. 
 
When this happens the rpms gauge will bounce up and down and I can hear the engine sound like it’s revving as the rpm moves. Sometimes when this is happening while driving, it’s really jerky to go or to stop. 

Other things that happen while the rpms are bouncing is that the lights in the interior and headlights will flicker. Something that really scares me is that sometimes when it’s doing this it feels like it’s fighting the breaks- I will have the break pressed a normal amount and when it does the chugging thing it will start to move forward and I have to mash the break to stop. 

I know some will ask about the maintenance history/if I do it regularly and I’ll tattle on myself but don’t flame me for this. I don’t regularly check all the fluids (except for oil) and I’m not too sure on the condition of the battery or the spark plugs at this point. 

Any insight or words of wisdom are appreciated! 


ETA: I took it to the mechanic today, got an oil change, ran the codes, and checked the battery and spark plugs. It came back with these codes: P011, P0507, P1946, P000A, P0106, P0343, P2187. They said the timing was off (can someone explain in simple terms what this means?) but with really no further explanation than that. The battery and spark plugs are good. I’m lost on what to do, the car has over 200k miles so I’m not looking to get everything fixed into tip top shape but I want it to be safe to drive and reliable still- I just don’t want to spend a bunch of money on a car that I might not have for much longer. I don’t really trust the technician I spoke with, he didn’t really explain much and for some reason as we were walking out the door mentioned that the break went all the way to the floor. Idk what the significance of that is, the way I understood it is the break can go all the way to the floor if you push hard enough lol. 

I’m gonna do more poking around about the codes but if anyone can offer any explanation or advice on what to do it would be much appreciated! "

Portable jump starters
So, my car has a mysterious battery drainingissue and needs frequent jump starting - see my post history if interested but not really important for this. I'm trying to find a reliable short term solution that will keep me driving until I'm in a position to replace the car.

I have the 1000 amp NOCO boost jump starter which has saved me a bunch of times in the past 6 months or so but the issue has recently gotten so bad that it doesn't do the job any more. Car drains the jump starter and still won't turn over. 

A roadside mechanic rescued me with his own jump starter, which worked instantly. I asked about it and he said it was a 4000 amp starter and it cost him about £100 - a similar amount that I paid for mine. I failed to note down the brand. He explained that mine would work when the battery still has some charge but not when it's fully drained.

Done some research and found 4000 amp or more jump starters for this price and less. Prices seem roughly proportional to the number of amps, but the NOCO devices are several times the price of other brands.

I want a device that will consistently start my car when the battery is fully drained.

My questions:
 - is the ampage the primary (only?) important figure for me?
 - why do the NOCO ones seem to be vastly more expensive?
 - any reason I shouldn't trust these cheaper brands?

Thank you!

Battery has been replaced several times (most recently two years ago) and alternator once about three years ago. Mechanics are routinely baffled. Something drains the battery when switched off. Used to be very occasionally (once or twice a year) but now almost every time I use the car. I am open to thoughts on the issue itself but that's not what I'm asking about.

Does anyone know a good all season tires? I'm currently between Vredestein, General and Yokohama
I usually buy Michelins, but it seems they stopped making the Defenders for the Honda Fit EX. I looked on TireRack and picked the ones that were most popular and had the longest warranty, but I'm not familiar with any of these brands. Can anyone tell me if Vredestein, General or Yokohama are reliable?

Basically looking for a good tires that will be good for gas mileage, not horrible in the snow and last as long as possible. Additionally the brand and warranty are important too since I'll probably have to get the same brand of tires if I use the warranty.

Thanks for any advice!

1993,honda,civc, 1.6 L 4-cylinder, 130,000
xHi guys,

having issues with my car. the issue first started as the car would crank but not turn on. i then found out that if i keep the key in the ignition for a half a minute the fuel pump would prime and would turn on. but as the fuel gets lower and lower the longer it would take to prime. at this point my car will not turn off randomly. eventually it did get to that point where it would turn off randomly.

no problem. i changed the fuel filter and it seemed to be a magic fix. it would even turn on on the first go. thought i fixed it but the problems started to rear its ugly head again progressively. the next step was changed the fuel pump. i had no problems for a day before it started to turn off again. id like to mention that if it turns of id have to anywhere from 5-15 minutes before it could turn on again.

i then moved on to changing the alternator. alternator worked wonders. would turn on reliably at first crank. no shuts off for three days. no problems. but today it turned off on me. 

any suggestions before i go head and take it to a mechanic?

&#x200B;

thanks."

Is it time to replace the Prius?
I apologize if this is the wrong sub. I am looking for second opinions on whether it's worth pouring more money into car repairs vs. getting a new one.

For starters, I cannot afford a good car. A cheap used one (around $5000-$6000CAD) would clear me out and I prefer not to get a loan. However, I have someone who would do up a strong loan application for me if that's the best longterm solution.

I have a 2009 Toyota Prius, inherited from family. Odometer is about 240,000. Check engine light has been on since I received the vehicle in 2021, but mechanics have not considered it a priority. I just spent $3200CAD (ouch) on necessary repairs (back wheel studs & axel, front wheel bearings, & rear breaks). This is the second time I've replaced a wheel bearing.

Unfortunately, car still needs work. It has no shock absoption and needs a new strut on the front end (at least). I was also told front breaks will eventually need replacing.

In short, the car is expensive to maintain. However, mileage is better than I could get on most used vehicles. I also don't want to buy used only to have the same maintenance costs I have. Car repairs are extremely stressful as a woman who doesn't know the mechanics, since I always feel it's a coin toss that I'll get scammed (plus finding time when I don't need the vehicle). I already stopped going to one shop due to bad work there (that caused broken wheel).

Is it time to replace? And if so, what's the sensible longterm course of action?

Tl;dr: 2009 Prius costs thousands in repairs. Limited budget for new vehicle. What's the most cost-effective & reliable longterm solution?"

What type of mechanic/car shop should I go to?
I hope this is the right sub for my question(s).

I drive a 2006 Nissan Sentra. It's a 4-cylinder engine, automatic transmission. Bought it used in 2009 when it had \~30K miles on it. Has just over 100K now; I have worked from home for many years, so didn't put miles on with a daily commute. It's nothing fancy, but this car has been \*great\* to me. I'm not a big car guy and this car has been reliable and very low maintenance, but it's starting to go downhill.

I don't know a ton about cars, so please be merciful. The first issue I'm experiencing is that the driver's side door won't open from the inside anymore. I have to roll the window down to let myself out. Is that something I can just take to any mechanic or do I need some kind of specialist for that?

Secondly and more important, it stalled out on me a few months ago when I was stopped at a red light, but started right back up with no lights lit up on the dashboard, and I didn't think much else of it. It did it again a few weeks ago, and I noticed I lost power steering and power breaks. Also when I was stopped at a red light, but I was able to coast to the shoulder and, again, it started right back up with no problems.

Fast forward to this past weekend when I was driving and it felt like it was sputtering and on the verge of stalling again. The check engine light came on. I was near my destination, so I parked right away. When I came back to it, it started right up and got me home with no lights on the dashboard and no problems, but I've been scared to drive it since.

I talked to some friends who know a little more about cars than me and they think it might be the alternator. For routine stuff like oil changes and break replacements, I usually take it to the Midas shop that's right down the street from me. I feel like they've always been honest with me and did good work, so my gut is to go back there. 

Does anyone have input on whether or not that's a good option for more serious repairs?

TL;DR - 2006 Nissan Sentra \~100K miles. Has been extremely reliable, but now the driver's door won't open from the inside and I'm having issues with sputtering/stalling. Is it a good idea to take it to a usually-reliable Midas for repairs or should I seek some kind of specialist(s)?"

Toyota Camry front passenger seat problem
I have a 2009 Camry Hybrid which runs well. However my wife in the last year developed back problems and she complains that the front passenger seat is too low.

Her physical therapist has told her that the low seat  causes her knees to be lower than her hip and this aggravates her back pain.

The front passenger seat is a power seat with power forward and back and rear tilt, whereas the front driver seat does have height raise/lower adjustment.

Can anything be done to adjust the front seat higher or lower. My wife tells me she needs a power front seat so she can lower it to get into the seat and raise it after she is seated.

I llove my Camry, it's comfortable and reliable. Is there anything I can do to make the front seat meet her needs, or do I have to buy another car?

My 2012 Chevy Cruze dies sometimes while idling.
It's really weird because it's a reliable car.  I've used it for doordash for over a year.  It runs great.  But sometimes, only every once in a while, it will just die while idling.  No sounds or anything to indicate there is anything wrong.  Then it fires right back up immediately and it's good to go.  It seems to do it whenever I have the heater or AC running.  And it seems to do it only after i start it up for the first time of the day.  What could be causing this?"

Connectors Designed for High-Temperature Environment
I am looking for a connector to this environment and replace that one:

* 250VAC
* 15A
* 200ºC

The connection will be between multi-strand wire and thermal fuse leads. See this image to check what kind connector I am talking about (yellow connector, maybe the material is brass): https://ibb.co/xjV0kH4

Ideally, the connector should be both reliable and, at the very least, insulated.

I'm uncertain about the name of this connector (the yellow piece in the image), and I'm also unsure if it's made of brass. Additionally, I'm curious about its functionality. My assumption is that the connector is essentially an empty tube that is crimped and compresses multi-strand wire against the thermal fuse leads."

Been struggling for awhile and just landed my first job as a property inspector which requires full use of my own vehicle.

&#x200B;

>**2012 Chevy Equinox LT AWD - 4Cyl 2.4L**  
160k miles

Here's how my nightmare began:

I got the car last year from a private seller. It had around 150k miles and it's been reliable for me up until now. If the car sits for more than a day without being driven, the battery would be dead and I have to use a portable starter to get it going. Most times I've had luck, but also times where I had to call someone to give me a jump from their vehicle. I got a new battery and it wasn't long before the issue came back. I also noticed a rough start-up and some rattling that seemed to go away once I started driving. It eventually started getting louder, more rattling sounds and then would shake when I shut the engine off. Now the ""reduced engine power/stabilitrak"" warning came on while I was driving and it was having trouble going over 50mph or so. I can still drive the car but only in town and I know it needs to be repaired immediately.

After doing some research, I realized there was a recall issued October 2020 **""N192268180 Tailpipe Emissions – Oxygen Sensor N192268180 Tailpipe Emissions – Oxygen Sensor""** I called the dealership and was told to schedule for the recall repair and that they will only service the recall for free and will have to do diagnostic to see what else is wrong. The diagnostic is going to cost me $175 just to find out. My appointment isn't until next week and I haven't committed to the diagnostic check because I just honestly can't afford it.

Took it to Auto parts store and these are the codes that popped up:

**POWER TRAIN P0172: P0010 P0013 P0191 P062F**

**CONTROL MODULE POWER CIRCUIT C08000-03**

**U0401-71**

The worker recommended taking a chance on putting Seafoam in the gas & oil and see if it would help for the time being. It actually seemed to help with the rough idle, but I'm still afraid to take it on the interstate or drive it over 40-50mph. I am having to jump start the car every 2-3 days. 

Right now, I'm desperate for any advice on where to even begin repairing this car. I would like to hear from others who had the same issue and what steps were taken to repair it. I've managed to fix and maintain my own HVAC system this summer through youtube and google, I like troubleshooting and don't mind getting in there and doing any of the repairs myself if possible.

**Is there anything I can do myself if I am able to get the parts?** 

**With this huge list of repairs, what would be the most important one to get fixed first if you're low on funds?**

*Please help! I am a single mom of 3 and I cannot afford to purchase another vehicle right now. Hoping to be able to do some repairs myself at least until I can get it looked at professionally. I need this vehicle to last me another 6 months to a year. Any advice, tips, tricks, or possible solutions are greatly appreciated. TIA!*"

Looking for advice! Stalling, hesitation, black exhaust and the dash is lit up like a christmas tree. Nobody can fix it... 2016 Subaru Forester XT
 Hoping someone here has encountered this issue and can shed some light on what might be the problem(s). I have seen similar issues in other posts and forums but none that really match. Sorry for the novel i want to be as detailed as possible in case these separate issues are connected.

I have a 2016 Subaru Forester XT 2.0 AWD that I bought in ’19. It ran completely fine for a few years and then I started to notice occasional hesitation while accelerating and some strange idling, as if it were about to stall. Started around 140k miles. The symptoms were infrequent and there seemed to be no pattern when this would happen. I figured it would go away with a tune up but it did not. Not long after, it stalled on me while coming to a moderately abrupt stop at a red light. Pretty much every warning light came on in the dash, but it started right back up after turning the ignition off and back on. Took it back in, mechanic ran diagnostics, no glaring issues. Indicator light stayed off for a day or 2 then came back on. Since it drove fine 90% of the time I continued driving it. The stalling has occurred very occasionally to this day. No rhyme or reason, but if the car is going to have a bad day, I can tell within a few minutes of driving. Eventually I learned how to prevent stalls on those days by coming to a very gradual stop, sometimes having to feather the accelerator after the stop. 

Next issue came one day when I began driving and it was feeling sluggish/hesitating. Got on the highway and I could see a trail of dark exhaust in my rearview. It felt like it was directly related to whatever acceleration issue was present, but again, it was an intermittent problem with no pattern. Black exhaust one day, no black exhaust the next. Brought it back in, mechanic ran diagnostics, no glaring issues. Reset the computer but warning lights came back on again. On one occasion, these symptoms got bad quickly on the freeway and my engine flat out died. It felt like I ran out of gas but fuel gauge was at a quarter tank. This time it would not turn over for me and I had to get it towed to the nearest shop. They had to push it into the garage bay. It sat overnight, next day they ran diagnostics and put some fuel in it and were able to get it started. Drove it home as if there was never a problem. For the record I know the tank was low but it had fuel in it and don’t believe this was the issue. I say this because I have a very good feel for the car and its habits/history.

Shortly after I brought it into the Subaru dealership where they performed an oil change (religiously done with full synthetic every 5k miles since I bought it) replaced the engine air filter and investigated the dash light issues once more. I asked them to look at the transmission as I was concerned. Nothing. I then circled back to my trusted family mechanic who double checked everything. He found nothing wrong but said the catalytic converter was fine for now but would need replacement soon. 

Since then the dark exhaust has disappeared. The dash lights have remained on but the car drives perfectly aside from the occasional stall upon stop. Still only happens on “bad days”. The hesitation issue is there but barely noticeable. Warning lights that have remained on include: Check engine, traction control, hill start assist and ABS. Cruise control also stopped working at the same time all the lights came on.

Now Im trying to sell and get into a truck. Obviously those dash lights are a huge red flag for potential buyers, and I’m not comfortable selling privately because I don’t want to sell anyone a lemon. Im completely dumbfounded after visiting 3 different shops on 5 separate occasions and having no concrete answers. The car is less than 10 years old and in otherwise great condition, best trim level, relatively low miles, leather etc. Id go as far as saying that it’s been a reliable daily driver even with its issues. I got a $6500 offer from 3 different dealerships but I see the same vehicle selling for $16k. Do I take the losses and run? Continue paying for diagnostics and getting no answers? If it makes sense financially id prefer to fix the issue and sell a reliable SUV at a fair price. From what I’ve gathered in forums, I’m not the only one experiencing these problems. Most point to a MAF sensor, Vacuum hose, O2 sensor, idle air control, throttle body or the CVT transmission being bad. Some of these fixes are expensive and seem to be often misdiagnosed so I’m reluctant to bring it in and risk spending thousands on the wrong fix. 

Can any Subaru experts weigh in and advise me on where to start? 

Thanks,

Sliz"

2016 Outback with battery drain issues--repairable? Is it cost effective to repair?
We own a 2016 Subaru Outback with about 60k miles on it. We drive it every few weeks, and try run the engine on a weekly basis. 

It's suffered consistently from battery drain issues (replaced battery 3 times in the last four years), and today the battery drained and the starter seems to be malfunctioning. (Electronics turn on. 

I'm now waiting for a tow truck to arrive. 

I'm worried about: replace the starter, only for the battery to die again swiftly. 

Should we get it repaired? Have folks seen these problems be solved, cost-effectively? Or is it more trouble than it's worth? (We're heavily considering trying to sell the car.) 

From reviews online, it seems like there are common problems with the starter, alternator, and the electrical systems draining the battery quickly.

2014 - Toyota Corolla - Transmission Issue - HELP!
Hi friends,

CAR: 2014 Toyota Corolla LE - 215,000 KM

I need some advice. I have a 2014 Toyota Corolla that has a CVT transmission with 215,000 Km's on it. Around a few weeks back the car started having issues with its transmission. Basically when I try to accelerate the car it won't accelerate properly. The car kind of stalls but you can hear the acceleration sound. This started happening periodically but now its been happening more and more. Also when the car is running for too long its more likely to happen. During this time the check engine light has also come on a few times.

I have taken the car to a mechanic who has stated the transmission needs to be replaced. This is a mom/pop mechanic who runs his own shop. He has said to rebuild the transmission he will charge me $4,500.00 CAD. I was iffy about getting it done here and told him I want to get some more quotes.

I took the car to a Mr. Transmission. The owner acknowledged the transmission issue, however, he wasn't able to say what exactly the issue is at this point. He said he needs to take the transmission out and check how to move forward. He also said if the transmission needs to be replaced we can look into getting a used one. He is basically asking me for $700.00 to take the transmission out and then he will tell me my options if it can be rebuilt or if we should get a replacement.

I have also called a Toyota parts dealer who have said a new transmission is like $10,500.00 CAD roughly and they have a rebuilt one for $5,500.00 CAD roughly. Furthermore, i reached out to a shop that sells transmissions and I have been given options to buy used ones from old cars i guess ranging from $2,500.00 to $4,000.00 CAD. These used ones have warranty ranging from 6-months to 3-years.

I have never had to have a transmission replaced so really unsure on what is the most cost effective but at the same time reliable option. If I can get some advice from people on what I should do I would appreciate the help."

So I, as does everyone by now, know about the CVT issues these things have. I bought the vehicle at 90 k and it now has 166k miles on it, and it isn't the original transmission. Had a p0744 code throw the other day which is says Torque converter circuit intermittent. The strange thing is that it didn't throw any jutter codes with it. Now the questions.

1. Because it didn't throw any jutter codes, is it possible it is just a wiring issue as opposed to the actual convertor itself.
2. Were the replacement transmissions that came with the original warranty any better than the ones they had on that fell apart in 90k or less? If not, am I looking at needing a 3rd!?! Transmission for the same car.
3. Is it possible to change the torque converter without putting in a whole new transmission? The car is only going for $5-6k at dealerships, so I think 12-1400 is all I want to put in the vehicle. If it's a new trans at 3-4k, I'd rather just put that money on a reliable Toyota at this point."

Key not turning reliably
This is for my 2000 Toyota Solara.

Lately it has been taking me anywhere from 20 seconds to 10 minutes to find that sweet spot that allowed me to turn the key in the ignition.

So I had this problem a few years ago and at the time figured I'd need a new key since it was the original key and could be worn. But without explanation it ceased to be a problem for while. But now it's back. 

I have a backup key that I can't figure out how to program. I've tried so many methods found online but although the key can turn the battery on, it cannot turn over the engine. With this key inserted, I can turn it in the ignition reliably. The master key is what is giving me trouble. 

Any ideas what is going on?"

Clinks and squeaks on 2005 Subaru Legacy at low speeds only

The car is a 2005 Subaru Legacy 2.5L base model (no turbo) with 180k miles, automatic transmission.

[First video has the clink, second video has the squeak.](https://imgur.com/a/QGw5BIN )

Both cropped up at the same time-- right after getting the car back from the mechanic.

Recent work done: rear transmission mount, exhaust gasket, all new brakes (calipers/rotors/pads), new tires.

Other known issues: bad CV joints (car also makes clicking on turns), worn tie rods & ball joints. [The transmission is also loud when shifting](https://imgur.com/a/AbKUJPr) between park/neutral/drive/reverse (possibly pitch mount stop?), although it shifts smoothly and quietly on the road.

Brakes were my first guess for the squeak, but it does NOT seem to be coming from any of the wheels. It sounds like it's from the center front of the car. The clink also seems to be from the center front of the car.

These sounds both *only* occur at very low speeds. 2mph seems to be the most reliable way to trigger them. They disappear at around 5mph. The clink happens with the car in drive, reverse, or even moving in neutral.

My husband thinks the squeal only happens after the car has recently turned. 

I am lost. My best guess is CV axle? But it's a clink instead of a tick like the CV joint noise on turns, and the clink happens whether turning or going straight. Any ideas?

[Edit]: in case anyone else has this same issue, it was the driveshaft. Couldn't see it from under jacks, but could see the problem clearly once it was up on a lift."

Odd situation…could I get away with fixing my dad’s car behind his back?
Not sure if this is the place to go, but I’m (25M) in an odd situation. His 2005 Pontiac Grand Prix needs a brake job and it has for a few months. My dad is a 53 year old mechanic and he insists on fixing cars himself when they act up, but sometimes he just…doesn’t. Like he doesn’t think the issue is serious. However, I’m the one who ends up driving it, not him (long, irrelevant story), and I want to get the brakes done with a mechanic. If I suggested it, he’d probably be like “I’ll get to it” without getting to it anytime soon. 

Thing is, I’m not the insurance policy holder. I plan on just paying out of pocket, as I have quite a bit saved up. I’m wondering, will my parents be informed somehow? Like maybe they have to notify them via the insurance policy even if the insurance is not used? And in general, is this a bad idea?

Edit: so I already got a free diagnostic appointment from a reliable mechanic. I’m gonna go to that, then if it’s a certain amount, above 500 or so, I’m just gonna talk to dad about it and wait. As much as I’d like learning, I…don’t want to make y’all be my therapist, I’m just gonna say I can’t see things going over that way. Experience says otherwise. He’ll probably fix it himself though. I feel like I’m in a rush to fix it because my mom, who isn’t in the best shape physically, just got a surgery and is now going to start driving regularly again, and I trust myself in rural areas with those brakes, but the thought of her being in that situation makes me nervous"

Wranglers Easy To Work On?
My wife and I are about to travel out on a cross country road trip for a few months in our converted bus. We want to tow a car and are limited to those able to be flat towed. Primarily a mini Cooper or a Jeep wrangler are the two that would fit our needs. Leaning more towards a Wrangler since I’ve heard minis have bad reliability. 

I’m fairly new to mechanical work. I’ve got some odd and end mechanical tools but not many from doing small work on the Cummins 5.9 in the bus. I’ve done oil changes and coolant changes but not much more although I’m a testament to the “any idiot can follow instructions” philosophy.  I’d love to get an older wrangler (automatic trans ≈1995 or so) to work on on the road as needed. Is that something feasible? How easy are wranglers to work on for a rookie? Thanks in advance!"

2003 Honda CR-V: worth it to replace front struts?
2003 Honda CRV

Went for tire rotation at local chain (Les Schwab) tire/brake place. They say front struts look OEM and should be replaced. For $860.

I love this car and have driven every one of the 250000+ miles that are on it. It is reliable and seems to run basically fine. I have had regularly scheduled maintenance done on it for its entire life.

So it's on great shape as far as I, a completely mechanically stupid person, knows. I plan to drive it until it dies.

Is it worth it to do this repair tho on a car so old? If it is, is $860 a good price?

While most of the miles are in town/highway, I also use it to get to the back country, so it needs to not go kaput on me 20 miles back"

I've been waiting SEVEN MONTHS for a headliner for my 2016 Tundra
Flopped my 16 Limited in mid-December after sliding into the ditch in a blizzard and I had it towed to the local dealership. Damage was minimal but the side curtain airbags deployed so I need a headliner. Apparently that's unobtainium because every 2 weeks they tell me ""two more weeks until it's available to ship two weeks after"". Most recent update was on 6/30 for 7/15 availability and an ""early August"" ship. They've literally told me this every two weeks for the last 5 months or so via telephone and the ""Toyota Brand Engagement"" portal so I'm not holding my breath.

After a few weeks of waiting on the part, I tried a few things:

\-Repair: Found an upholstery shop who would repair it. Called my insurance AGENT who agreed a repair would be appropriate and he would call the insurance COMPANY to get it going. I called the dealership and let them know I was coming to pick it up and that's when things got weird. They want me to sign a waiver because the headliner ""deadens the blow"" of the side airbag and because it's not repaired, they're not comfortable releasing it. I'm not comfortable signing, so they said they would just tow it to the repair shop for me. Next thing I know, the insurance COMPANY reaches out to me and said because it's part of the SRS system, it needs to be a factory replacement for them to cover it and said they'd drop coverage if I went that route. IANAL, can anyone confirm this is legal? Any of it?

\-Salvage replacement: The problem I ran into here is because of the size of the part and how ""fragile"" it is, nobody wants to ship it or even attempt to remove it. Some people even say the windshield needs to come out for installation. The closest one I could find that would let me pull it was in like AL (I'm in NH) so that's kind of out (but becoming more likely...)

\-Buy it from me: Tried to have the dealer buy it off me but because they don't know when the part will be available, they don't know what the market value of the truck will be at that time. They won't even make me an unreasonable offer hahahahaha

\-Total it: Asked the insurance company to just total it but $10k of damage, $30k truck. Not an option. FWIW, I have about $10K left on the loan.

I know this is kind of a shit luck situation, but I'm seeing a few problems here. First, I'm thinking the vast majority of trucks that need a headliner are just totaled, so I'm getting the feeling that this is less of a parts shortage and more of a ""we don't really make that part anymore because we didn't think anyone would need one"" kind of thing. I mean not exactly, but you get the gist. At one point Toyota told me they were ""looking for a new sub supplier for the board needed for the headliner assembly"" but I've been fucked for so long now I can't tell if it's smoke or what. Is it possible that this part just might never be available? I mean, I can't just call them up and order a factory headliner for my 86 Pickup, can I?

Second problem I'm seeing is how long it's been sitting. While it was there, I had them take care of a head gasket that I found leaking onto my alternator because I'm still under warranty. They ""resealed the valve cover"" (stay tuned for a follow up on that potential trainwreck when I finally get it back) so the truck got moved a few times in February. In March, I called the body shop and asked them to start it up every once in a while for me... maybe spin it around the lot a few times. The guys over there have been pretty cool so I'm hoping they're taking care of her, but I have no way of actually knowing. At this point, that gas is probably getting a little gross, the battery is almost dead, and there are GENERATIONS of mice living in there. Who's responsible for this? (he asked knowingly).

I think I only have two options here: Wait it out... potentially forever, or go get the truck and either have it repaired; to which my insurance company eluded would make the vehicle ""uninsurable and unsellable"" (because it's part of the SRS?), or tape it up and drive it around until the part comes in. Either way, I'd have to find new insurance. It also sounds like they've already paid the dealership and nobody wants to reopen the case and do more work.

Anyone that has more info on this topic want to offer me a little guidance? I talked to Consumer Affairs and the BBB but they said other than terrible business practices on Toyota's part, nobody is really doing anything wrong. I pretty much lost my job because of this... it would be cool if I could get some reliable transportation back before I loose my little side business, too...

TLDR- 16 Tundra needs a headliner. Toyota doesn't have headliners. Insurance only wants a Toyota headliner. Dealership won't release vehicle until repair is completed. Everyone thinks I'm going to get decapitated because the thin layer of cardboard and fabric between the airbag and my noodle isn't made by Toyota. Moral of the story, if you're gonna blow your side airbag, make sure you total it. No half sends, folks."

Replacing rotors - size, new pads too?
Two years ago, I replaced the front pads on our 2018 Toyota RAV4, but didn't machine the rotors. 10 months ago, they started vibrating, so (after the new rotors I ordered were the wrong size) I had them machined at O'Reilly. I read many different methods on break-in procedures and thought I'd done it well. A couple months ago they started vibrating again. Why?  

If I replace the rotors, should I replace the pads too?  

I have the correct vehicle in Amazon, including the trim model (XLE), but the rotors Amazon said would fit were still smaller diameter than the OEM ones. Any way I can be sure they send the correct ones? Anyone know what size it should be?

I’m confident I can replace it myself. I just simply don’t know for sure what type of replacement to get since there are several options that “fit my vehicle”. I don’t want to waste anyone’s time, so sorry if this is a stupid ask.

Questions about A/C compressor replacement - 2012 Hyundai Sonata 2.4L
I just had my **2012 Hyundai Sonata 2.4L** in to check why my A/C wasn't working. They said the compressor was dead and needs to be replaced. The only one they could find was $1300 that needed to be shipped to them. I looked online and found a handful of different brands, each around $500-$600.

So my questions are...

1. Are brands like Denso, 4Seasons, GPD, UAC what they would use in shop?

2. Are they trying to screw me saying the only one they could find was $1300? Or could their suppliers have limited options.

3. Are [these compressors](https://partsavatar.ca/hyundai-sonata-compressor?sortBy=lowToHigh&year=2012) compatible with my car? They have the same VS16E designation that was noted on the invoice I got.

4. Any recommendations on reliable aftermarket brands or ones to avoid?

5. Lastly, all the compressors return policies mention a need for a new Orifice Tube/Expansion Valve and Drier. I think the kits include the Expansion Valve but is the drier the Filter Drier included in some of the kits? [example](https://partshawk.com/four-seasons-83004-a-c-receiver-drier-desiccant-element.html)


I don't have a ton of experience with auto repairs so any other thoughts or insights are welcome.

***

In case it helps, here is what was written on the invoice 

>**Work Performed**
>
>Confirmed A/C was inop, can hear whine noise as well. Fan not running. ECM data showed A/C compressor on when it is off. Compressor pressure does not change as it should when engaged. Checked pins and connections. Requires new compressor and recharge.

Issues with door and alarm on 2007 Honda Odyssey
Hey everyone,

I'm not much of a car guy so please excuse me getting any of the terminology wrong. My family's 2007 Honda Odyssey minivan has been acting up lately and I'm wondering just what the hell is wrong with it. It's been in our family for a long time and we have \~300k miles on it. Money has been tight so we've been stalling on replacing it for a while. Overall though it's been a reliable car that was working fine until recently.

Around Thanksgiving last year my son was driving it and scraped and dented the the passenger side sliding door on a wall while turning into a parking garage. Since then the door has been having issues opening and closing and the car's sensors think it is open. Other than the door sensor issues there were no problems driving it from November 2022 through the start of January 2023.

In the past two weeks though the car's been acting up and I suspect it's related to the door. First the battery would drain if the car wasn't driven every day. Now, in the past week the car alarm has gone off twice; first in the middle of the day last Saturday and, most recently, three times this morning between 4:30 am - 6:00 am.

If any one has any advice on how to at the very least get the alarm to stop going off both myself and my neighbors would really appreciate it. thanks"

08 Scion XD 1.8 - P0301 - Cyl 1 misfire
Hey guys, I'm in a massive pickle.

I have a 2008 scion XD (2ZR-FE) with 250k or so on the odo. Its been by far the most reliable car i've ever had with only the coils and wheel bearings going bad and unfortunately, Im looking to you all to confirm my thoughts.

First off, I'm decently mechanically inclined, however, I live in an apartment building so I'm limited to jobs that only take a few hours, otherwise the property management gets annoyed.

The background:

My car has made a bit of a metallic squealing for a while now when it was cold, the sound seemed to be coming from the alternator (which is next to cyl 1) so I figured I'd ride it out until the alternator gave out. Well, now I think I'm paying for assuming.

Last night the car threw a P0301. In the past its been a coil pack so I  swapped Coil to Cyl 2. No change. Then I checked the spark plug. Cyl 1 plug looked lean lean lean. I swapped it with cyl 2. No change.

Going off of the lean looking plug, I swapped the fuel injector to see if maybe it was clogged, as I could still hear it firing. No change. Still throwing P0301 on Cyl 1.

&#x200B;

Am I missing anything that I can still test? I don't have a borescope or a compression tester and truthfully, *I don't think it matters given my restrictions on working on it.*

Unfortunately at this point I'm thinking that I may have some catastrophic damage that isn't gonna be fixable by me in a few hours in the parking lot, but I wanted to make sure I have all my bases covered before I take it to the shop and decide whether to fix it or just buy a new car.

&#x200B;

Edit: After writing this I went and unplugged coil 1 while the car was running. There was no change in sound or idle however, I know that plug/coil/injector are good which leads me to believe there's a compression issue. Crap.

&#x200B;

Edit 2: WELP. Turns out my scan tool is a piece of shit. The entire time it wasn't actually reading any new codes. Turns out when I moved the coil it WAS switching cylinders, my tool just refused to report it. But also, weirdly, I didnt get an ignition coil code this time however, replacing the coil has fixed the issue.

Lesson learned about cheap tools. Now I gotta keep an eye on that cylinder 1 for lean conditions as apparently the intake gaskets can cause it to go lean."

opinions on using stop leak for coolant system
Hi all, I'm wondering what stop leak you would recommend and if you think it's a good plan of action for me. 

For starters my car is a total beater and needs allot of work, however it runs and drives and has been very very reliable over the past 5 years and 80k miles or so that I've had it. I have an 05 mercury mariner 6 cyl.

Problem is a small/medium leak has just started from the radiator. Seems like its where the plastic tank meets the radiator tubes. Now I understand a radiator on this vehichle is pretty easy and not to pricey but...

I really don't want to put the time and money into it. The heater core has has a small leak since I got it 5 yrs ago. This leak seems a little larger this season as I'm smelling it much more and also seeing alot more steam fogging my windshield when I try to defrost. I also need to leave for work (45 min drive) at 5am tomorrow morning. And my car is a total peice of junk with a rotted frame and bad flexpipe and bad cats and 4 bad swaybar links and all motor mounts bad. Serious water leak from the moon roof has been soaking passenger sear and floors for a long time. 

Im debating trying to dig up the receipt for the radiator (replaced it about 2 yrs ago give or take) and hoping it's still covered and available today (sunday) and doing the job. I have no intentions of replacing the heater core as I don't want to do that big job unless I really need to. I keep thinking about using a stop leak and hoping it works but I'm paranoid ill clog stuff up. I just started a new job and can't afford a new daily driver in today's market. 

Would anyone recommend a stop leak for me? Is there a specific product ill be able to pick up at Napa, pepboys, advance auto parts, or autozone? What do you think is the risk involved? Thankyou!"

09 automatic Yaris downshifting hard
Our Yaris has started down shifting hard. It's not very noticeable city driving, but extremely jarring on a mountainous Highway.

Downshifting from 3rd to 2nd isn't too bad, but if you are on a steep hill and downshifting at highway speeds it feels terrible. On road trips I often manual switch between 4th and 3rd when I need more power and that feels completely normal. I just let off the gas a little, downshift and then accelerate back up. I have the 3-d shifter where 3rd and drive are next to each other.

I had a mechanic check the motor mounts and they were intact.

I brought it into Toyota dealership and all they said was that the transmission would have to be replaced.

Since it shifts fine manually, I wonder if it could be something else. Is there something to adjust that would control engine rpms while shifting that could be causing it to not be dropping rpms during shifting? Or something that controls the timing?

Thanks! The car runs great and has less than 200k kms. It's been very reliable besides this shifting problem"

tapping at idle only ?? please help!


Ok I bought my 2013 Kia soul (base 1.6) a year and a half ago. It ran fine, very reliable and still is . It did have a tap at idle when I bought it but I wasn't worried, ime I have had cars that tapped at idle & acceleration before & last for years & I maintained them very well so tapping didn't scare me..one finally died from car wreck & other I simply just needed a bigger car so sold it.
Anyway I knew those cars the lifters we're tapping but I. Not so sure with this kia I have now as it DOES NOT GET LOUDER AT ACCELERATION NOR DOES IT TAP AT ALL AT ACCELERATION, ONLY AT IDLE. Sometimes during our great Ohio humid hot days with a running and it driven all over town for 30 minutes or more straight the tapping at idle will get a lil bit louder , other wise it stays about same volume.
I have driven this car everywhere with this mysterious idle tap, Florida 4x, W.V.2x, Michigan 1x, Tenn few times & so on.. and it made it all times with no issues except once the check engine light came on, upon testing it at the Florida Georgia line area Advance Auto it said cylinder misfire on one...  
But it ended up disappearing without resetting it and it has only came back on once again on trip back to Florida months later then disappeared again. One other thing it does that makes me think it may have poor oil pressure or flow or something related is that will make that chit chattering noise cars make when they need oil but only when I am going up a steep hill & trying to keep a speed all others are at around me .but it doesn't need any oil.
I have kept up oil changes & filter change and other maintained..only kinda bigger repairs were struts, brakes, sway thingy & other item I can't remember the name but it wasn't engine related.
When I took it in last month for the resent recalls I asked about the tapping and was told I needed to put in a high pressure oil filter from the dealership , not after market. But guess what.. no such part exists, I called thier parts dept & other dealerships and was told just that.. so they clearly just wanted me gone and to shut me up during the recall repair visit.
Please any ideas ???  I want this fixed asap. I love my kia. 

Oh yeh i bought it with high miles at 171k. .it's now near 179k and still hasn't let me down yet🤞"

2002 Subaru Legacy, worth it to put in replacement engine?
2002 Subaru Legacy L

190k miles

&#x200B;

The head gasket on one side is leaking, and I'm not willing to redo gaskets.

Would it be silly to put in a replacement engine, like a used 2.0 or 2.5? Might cost 1700 plus installation. 

Should I expect the original auto transmission to last long enough for that replacement engine? Never been abused.

Main concern is...are those used/rebuilt engines reliable enough? I don't want to install it and then have it go bad in a short time.

Feedback/experiences welcomed."

Are these the right updated parts for VTC-related fix on '09 Accord?
Hi! I'm looking to fix the well-documented rattle/grinding on startup due to the bad VTC actuator, per the technical service bulletin below:

[https://f01.justanswer.com/clmcr8/f705291b-acda-49b8-aeac-3238b7597171\_bulletin.pdf](https://f01.justanswer.com/clmcr8/f705291b-acda-49b8-aeac-3238b7597171_bulletin.pdf)

At 112k miles on my 2009 Accord, I'm way past the warranty, so I'm looking to buy the OEM parts myself.  I would really appreciate some help with two things:

1. My plan is to change all the related parts: VTC actuator, VTC oil control solenoid, and tensioner while I'm at it since it can easily be part of the same repair. The actuator and oil control solenoid are the redesigned R5A parts per the above TSB (14310-R5A-305 and 15830-R5A-A01, respectively) to replace the faulty R44 parts, but I'm wondering what the correct ""updated"" part I'd have to order for the tensioner? I've found 14520-RAH-H01 for the tensioner online, but am scared of buying the wrong one. Would these be correct, and am I missing something?
2. I searched the web for where I could reliably get OEM parts at a good price, but am confused by the parade of similar-sounding websites:

[https://www.hondaautomotiveparts.com/](https://www.hondaautomotiveparts.com/)  
[https://www.hondapartsconnection.com/](https://www.hondapartsconnection.com/)

...and many more! I'm assuming they can't all be legit, so can anyone recommend a trustworthy place for original parts? Thanks so much!  "

Can't start engine reliably
2011 Honda Civic doesn't have enough power to start the engine.

This seems to happen randomly.

Battery is \~ 4 months old. I replaced it because I thought that could have been the root cause.

Because this has been happening for over 4 months now, I've been fervent about ensuring no lights are accidentally left on, nothing is plugged in to the car, etc.

Sometimes the battery isn't fully dead. The remote keys might still unlock the powered door locks, the radio might turn on when I insert the key, but it doesn't have enough juice to start the engine. Eventually, if I keep trying to start the engine without a jump, it will go fully dead from all the failed attempts. Sometimes it's fully dead from the get-go.

After we jump start the car, it drives fine. I always make sure to drive it for at least a half hour after getting a jump. After driving it for a while, I've always been able to turn it off and back on without any issues on the same day (whether the engine is off for 10 minutes or a few hours, all the same).

Not being able to start the engine used to be rare, maybe once every other month, but now it's happening more often. Perhaps replacing the battery helped temporarily, but it's happening more frequently again, and the battery is only \~ 4 months old.

For example, yesterday, it didn't start after not being used for 2 or 3 days. We jump started the engine, drove it for 1.5 hours, turned if off for 45 minutes, turned the engine back on for 4 hours (driving), parked it in the garage, slept overnight and this morning, \~ 12 hours later, the car doesn't have enough juice to start the engine.

We took it to a Honda certified dealer, and they had the car for \~ 5 days. During that time, they never noticed any issues, and they told us that nothing was wrong.

I have no idea what to do.

Update 1: I borrowed a battery charger from my neighbor. I pulled out the battery and I'm going to let it charge for 6 or so hours. I'm going to clean the connections as best as I can with what I have around the house after work. If I can borrow a multimeter, I'll also try to test the battery (after full charge), the alternator and look for leaks."

2002 Ford Explorer Possble Air Intake Issue
So I took my 02 Explorer into the shop to check a service engine soon code. The only problems I've been having with the car are slight idling and once in a while it powers down at stop lights. My mechanic said it had 5 codes which suggested to him an air intake problem common in older model fords. I love this car. It has been incredibly reliable until now. Any advice on what the problem is and whether I should fix it or let the car go? My mechanic estimated 1000-1500, but said I should take it to a dealer because he doesn't do that kind of work."

Manual car - grinding 2nd into 3rd
Hello autorepair community,

My 2013 Toyota corolla (manual; 75k miles) recently started to have an issue when I shift between second and third gear. When I push into third gear, I have grinding until it engages and then it drives perfectly smoothly. If I stay in neutral for a hot second and let the RPMs come down, there appears to be a sweet spot (maybe around 2000 rpms) where I can push it in without grinding. Speaking with a friend of mine (who knows just a slight bit more about cars than me, but is no expert), his hypothesis is that there is an issue with the “synchro”.  I’m currently just shifting from second directly into fourth which is kind of annoying in city traffic.  He says that if I learn how to double clutch, I might be able to shift into third gear more reliably. This prompts two questions that I was hoping one of you fine car community folks could help me with.

To the diagnosticians:
1) Is it likely that my 2nd to 3rd gear “synchro” has gone bad? If so, is this an expensive fix? (Can provide more information if needed)

To the expert manual drivers:
2) would learning how to double clutch potentially be helpful to more reliably shift into 3rd gear? If so, is this challenging to learn?

Thank you!"

Unable to start engine - due to Immobilizer aka security lights?!
I have been driving Yaris (2007 2DR - hatchback) for last 3+years, it's my first car ever and it's been so reliable ever since.

Once in a while, the vehicle won't start, meaning it won't even get to crank part, all i hear is a click. After extensive Youtube research 😜, I realized that my security light stays on solid, quite extensively.

When the security light turns off, the car will start normally. It could take anywhere between few secs to 15 mins, before the light goes off. Here's the thing, this problem only started a year ago and it's been intermittent ever since. I did not change keys nor ECU which i heard could trigger this problem.

I usually remove keys & insert it again, randomly it would recognize it and turns off the security light and am good to go. Lately, it's taking way more than 15 mins and taking it to the dealers would be an expensive repair.

I was thinking to try resetting or reprogramming ECU, as shown in this Youtube [video.] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_bVDAYgbyPI)

Has anyone else stumbled onto this issue before?

If you have any troubleshooting suggestions, please do let me know.

Thanks."

2002 Honda Accord EX - Transmission Issues (Advice)
The check engine light on my 02 Accord (89,000 miles) recently turned on. Since then, it randomly goes in and out of limp mode. I ran a diagnostic with my code reader and it came back with P0780, which is a shift error. After some research it seemed that the solenoids could be the culprit. A local transmission mechanic agreed that it's likely the solenoids.

I intend to do the repair on my own. Any advice on the repair process itself and a reliable source to get the parts from would be much appreciated. Thanks!"

Repair, or Sell and walk away
So I have a 2012 Mazda 3 GSKY, with about 115,000 KM on it. It recently started making some weird noises, so I took it down to a local repair shop. They believe it is an issue with the transmission. Unfortunately this shop is not experienced enough to actually fix a transmission. So when they come across transmission issues, they usually replace. In my case, they offered to replace my transmission with a used one for $2270 (Canadian dollars). The other option they provided was for me to take my car to the local Mazda dealership where they might actually be able to fix the transmission.

So that puts me a difficult place here..  as I just bought a 2019 Toyota Sienna back in Feb, I don't neccessarily NEED this Mazda 3 anymore. Given the current value of a 2012 Mazda 3, is it better to actually get the vehicle fixed by the dealership, or walk into the dealership with the intention of just selling it and walking away with a few grand cash.

I understand that there is no right or wrong answer, it totally depends on an individual's situation. In my case, I have another reliable vehicle, and don't really need the second car.. I just hope to get other people's advice and what you would do if you were in my shoes."

It's been giving me motor issues within the last year or so so I've decided to swap the motor to something more reliable. Comparing the B20B to (let's say) a B20z it's got a few differences.

Saab Front Strut Color Codes & Reliable Used Sources
 Hi Everyone. So i'm looking to get some input on a couple things.  


I need to replace the strut assembly on the drivers side for my 2007 Saab 9-3 2.0t because the mount bearing is bad and creaking.  
I bought a Quick Strut online a couple years ago, and it's been working fine since then, but it just started creaking again like the original one that was on it before.  
I purchased a used OEM strut off of ebay that appears to have the same exact problems, so now i'm trying to look for a new one and have two questions.  


1) What exactly do the color codes mean that are on the OEM struts? Like Blue vs Red/Purple, Sport vs non-Sport suspension, etc. I've seen these terms thrown around online and haven't found any concrete answers on what colors mean what kind of suspension.  


2) Does anybody know of any reliable vendors that sell used OEM struts that have the best chance of NOT having a bad mount bearing, and are decently priced? The only option I've found for decently priced OEM struts are off ebay, and the rest of the options on there look like ones picked out of junkyards."

93 BMW 525i Clutch Replacement [x-posted from r/mechanicadvice]
Hello, on 12/23/20 my clutch went out on the freeway (won't engage in any gear, accelerator revs with no movement in any gear) and I had to get my 93 525i towed home. Since then, I have received quotes from a few mechanics between $1700 and $2500 to replace the clutch.

I've been wrestling with what to do...I'm not a particularly wealthy person, and am currently on unemployment with around $16k to my name and no job in sight.

My questions are:

1. Is it possible the clutch merely needs to be readjusted, and how would I check that? When the car was working, the bite point was maybe 3"" from the resting position, and the clutch pedal went back around 10"" total.
2. Could I and a mechanically inclined friend perform the replacement ourselves? How much would that cost, and what is the likelihood that we screw it up badly?
3. Is it worth it to invest more money into this car if it is 27 years old and has around 180k miles on it? I don't want to put money into a car that is likely to fail in some other way sometime soon. A friend told me that $2500 to replace the clutch is still cheaper than getting a used car that is reliable, but I'd like your opinion.

Recently a windstorm knocked a tree into the back windshield as well, shattering it completely and leaving a large dent, and now the car won't turn over, making a cycling, clanking sound (I assume the battery is merely dead). I'm really not sure what to do, this is my first car and I'm a new driver without any experience to make a decision on whether to scrap it or not."

P1b25 High Voltage Battery Path Fault
It was about time I needed a new 12v battery on my 2015 Kia Optima Hybrid Ex so I went ahead and replaced it. Was driving around the very same day and about 5 hours later the acceleration to the car cut off and I could no longer drive the vehicle; luckily I was around the corner from my home. 

This is when EVERYTHING started happening. 
once I pulled over and turned vehicle off. Lights would come onto the dash but the vehicle wouldn’t flip over to “ready” and I was getting hybrid warning messages to turn off vehicle to prevent hybrid damage. That very same evening the same 12V I had just bought that same day was already drained dead. I was under assumption I would need to change Hybrid Battery. 

Fast forward a few months since then. Had my mechanic run some codes. He pulled 1 code which was p1b25. And here I am; I did extensive digging and realized it could be the High Voltage Fuse so I ordered the new part and put it in( I got entire housing not just the fuse and replaced the High Voltage Fuse Orange housing as well) ; and the vehicle was flipping over to ready while I had the dead battery on jumper cables. 

I went down the rabbit hole of getting a new 12v battery to see if the battery being fully juiced would help the gas powered engine kick on. Got nothing. 

Now after switching both High Voltage Fuse and 12V battery; vehicle doesn’t send me any hybrid warnings anymore. Instead; Now I’m receiving “check charging system” warnings and “stop vehicle to charge battery” when the car won’t even go anywhere (lol) and the engine still won’t turn on. Vehicle still wont accelerate. 

What should my next steps be? I’ve seen some people say that the p1b25 code either means 12v battery; the fuse; or the power relay. The only two things I haven’t fixed is the power relay nor the hybrid battery itself

Just don’t want to continue down a rabbit hole if I need to fix the hybrid battery. I’ve also seen some posts of people saying they fixed their hybrid battery and it still didn’t resolve these similar issues. 

Any advice with similar circumstances and what fixed the problem for you would be greatly appreciated and of tremendous help!

Fighting a knock sensor code for 2 years — and still can’t beat it. P0333, Jaguar S-Type 2003 3.0 N/A
Hi!

I have a persistent issue with my car, and I’ve been struggling with it for over two years. I've done a lot of work trying to bring the car to perfect condition — many things have been fixed or replaced — but this one issue just won’t go away.

**The problem:**

I’m getting **error code P0333**, which refers to the **knock sensor 2 circuit high input**.  
When this happens, the car goes into **“restricted performance”** mode and limits the RPMs to 3000.

**When the error occurs**

1. The error **always** shows up **at cold start** — if the car has been sitting for several hours. The error goes away **after some time**, and the duration **depends on outside temperature**:
   * In **cold winter**, it may take 30+ minutes;
   * In **hot weather**, it usually disappears within 10 minutes.
2. If I’m driving on the highway for more than \~2 hours, the error may **come back**, and it goes away again if I turn the engine off for some time.
3. The error sometimes shows up during **heavy rain** or after **driving through water**.
4. Occasionally, it can appear **randomly**, but that’s rare.

**Additional notes:**

* The error can be reset via **ELM** or **Jaguar IDS** software, but it **comes back after few seconds**.
* The **check engine light** doesn’t always illuminate when the error appears.
* If I reset the code with the engine **off**, it disappears — but comes back within seconds **after starting the engine**.
* The code **does not appear** with just ignition on — only after actual **engine start**.

**What has been done:**

1. Replaced the knock sensor with multiple original and compatible sensors (all tested — signal is correct);
2. Wiring from the knock sensor to the ECU was checked — everything is fine;
3. Fuel injectors cleaned;
4. Engine flushed with oil treatments multiple times (to remove deposits);
5. Brand new OEM alternator installed;
6. Engine mounts replaced with new OEM parts;
7. Tried running 95, 98, and 100 octane fuel — made no difference;
8. Engine ECU was re-flashed with the latest official firmware — no change;
9. Spark plugs replaced with correct new ones.

The engine itself runs **smooth and clean**. There are **no signs of knocking** or any other error codes.  
**Electrical systems are working fine**. Occasionally, in hot weather, I get a temporary ABS/DSC fault, but it disappears by itself and timing seems unrelated to the knock sensor erro

**Car details:**

**Car:** Jaguar S-Type 2003  
**Engine:** 3.0 V6 (AJ30)

I'm extremely grateful for any help, ideas, or advice you may have.  
This is literally the last remaining issue with the car — everything else is in great shape.  
I’ve already done so much trying to fix it that I’m out of ideas, and I’d really appreciate any suggestions.

Thank you!"

[HELP] Toyota Esquire won’t start after service/tune-up – Multiple warning messages on display

Hi everyone,

I’m having a serious issue with my Toyota Esquire hybrid (2015+) and hoping someone here can shed light.

Just yesterday, I had a full service and engine tune-up done. Today, when I tried to start the vehicle, it wouldn't start and a bunch of warning messages popped up on the display. All check lights were also on.

Here are the exact messages I'm seeing:

“Depress brake pedal and power switch to start” “12-volt battery low, when parking apply parking brake” “Read owner’s manual” “Hybrid System Has Stopped, please put shift lever into P” “Operation of electrical items restricted” The car won’t start even when I follow the prompts. I tried pressing the brake pedal and power button as instructed — nothing. Just the dash lighting up.

A few notes:

The 12V battery was tested recently and appeared fine. This all happened after a routine service and tune-up. I'm wondering if something was disconnected during service or if something was improperly refitted."

I wanted to surprise my dad with some nice pictures of his old Porsche from the late 70s (maybe 80s I don’t know sorry. All I know is that it’s still air-cooled). It hasn’t been moved in about 1 Year, maybe more. I just finished charging the battery but it doesn’t start up. Any advice on what to do next? "

Need help
I want to learn how to work on cars. I’m new into everything that has to do with body work. What would you guys recommend me to do? Do I really need to take classes for this type of work? Or can I learn by myself? I kind of want to learn by myself though. I currently have a beater. I paid $100 for the car. It’s a 1999 Honda Accord Ex V6 with 150,000 miles on it. It has body damage close to the gas cap. A friend fixed it with bondo but it looks nasty. The whole car was painted with Walmart cheap spray cans. I want to learn what’s the best way to start on fixing the issue. I’ve spent a lot of money and time fixing the problems it has. I don’t want to sell it because I won’t get enough for it. Might as well keep it as a project car. "

My Hyundai Tucson is having issue after issue
My car: 2023 Hyundai Tucson SEL, 33,500 miles, Engine: 2.5 L 4-Cylinder

I’m 20 years old and I got my car brand new, right off the lot, at 18. It only had 10 miles when I got it and worked perfectly the first year. Last year I slid on some black ice and hit a curb, I had my car towed to the nearest Hyundai dealership and had them check it out. They had my car for weeks, told me my t!re rods were bent and I needed an alignment. Alright cool, took it home seemed to be driving fine then I noticed this small noise. Didn’t think much of it. Then I hit a MAJOR hole in the road and the noise worsened a bit but still drove fine. Took it in for my oil change and inspection they said everything looked good. As I was driving one day the car started to shake really bad and the noise got way worse so I had it towed again. They told me my rim was bent and my wheel bearing was bad, got that replaced. The noise was not as bad but still there. I took it to another shop where they told me they never aligned my car but everything else looked good, so I got it aligned. The noise went away, then it slowly came back. Everyone around me advised me just to leave it because at this point I’ve spent thousands trying to figure out this noise and they keep saying it’s fine. Then I took my car in for another oil change and inspection, everything was fine. Took it in for my 30,000 mile checkup and to get all my fluids flushed, everything looked fine. Then my steering wheel started shaking at 31,000 miles, took it into the shop, they said my brakes were fine just to balance my t!res. I’d balance my t!res the shaking would stop, then the shaking would start again a day or two later. (I got brand new t!res 6 months ago at 20,000 miles.) I’d take them back to be rotated and everytime I went they said my t!res were out of balance and after 3 rebalances I took it back to the shop. Reiterated that this noise won’t go away and my steering wheel and cabin is shaking really bad. They said my rotors were warped and my intermediate shaft was bad. I was like okay let’s replace it. Got those replaced, they checked my transmission fluid and showed me what it should look like (clear) and showed me what mine looked like (black with chunks of metal inside) they diagnosed it that the power terrain is failing and told me it should hopefully be under Hyundais warranty. At this point my cars at 33,000 miles. I’m at such a loss with what to do. I’m gonna try the warranty route but I’m afraid they might not cover it. Everywhere I turn there’s a new issue with my car, they also told me earlier my rear shock mount was bad and there’s other alignments and minor repairs I haven’t mentioned in here. I’ve spent $8,000+ in trying to get this car repaired. People have recommended trading it in but my car has depreciated incredibly and I really don’t wanna get another car loan because it would be a huge loss financially. Any further recommendations?"

My Honda civic’s engine won’t start but the lights work. Any ideas?
It’s a 2016 Honda civic LX. A few weeks ago we got rear ended by a bus. We were able to drive it back home and the damage looked superficial. But when we tried to start the engine to take it to the mechanic, it wouldn’t start.

They towed it to the shop and we got it back yesterday. I drove it home no problem. But when I tried to start the engine today, it didn’t work. But the headlights and internal lights all turn on.

I’m waiting for the mechanic to call me back and figured I’d ask for help here. What do you think?"

I also had issues with acceleration it felt heavy at times. I changed the spark plugs, and it ran smoothly for the rest of that day, but the next day, the issue returned, It would shake occasionally and acceleration problem continued but the stalling stopped. 

I won’t lie I’ve been driving it like that for about a month. I took it to a mechanic this week, but he couldn’t find the issue. Now, today, my car won’t start at all. It cranks but won’t turn over. "

2000 Nissan Xterra no crank no start 
**Car:** 

2000 Nissan Xterra 3.3l 4x4 300,000kms

**Issue: no crank no start** 

Tests conducted 

* All electronics work fine
* Battery is fine 
* Car won’t jump, ruling out alternator
* Stater relay is fine 
* Car starts with jumper wire in terminals 7 & 6 of starter relay socket meaning starter motor is fine
* Fuses are fine 
* Tried starting the engine in neutral and have tried cycling through the gears a bunch before turning they key but no joy
* Starter relay has continuity on 3 & 6
* Ignition switch signal wire receives 12 volts
* Starter relay socket receives constant 12v power to terminal 1 and 4v to terminal 5 when the key is in the start position 
* No power through to other terminals and terminal 5 remains at 4v even when cranking the key 

**Ignition wires tests:** 

**Key in 1st position (accessories)** 

* Main car battery 12.2v
* Black 0v
* White and red 12.2v
* Black and white (think this is the signal wire to starter relay) 0v
* Red 12.5v

**Key in 2nd position (start)** 

* Main car battery 11.87v
* Black 0v
* White and red 11.87v
* Black and white (think this is the signal wire to starter relay)  11.87v
* Red 11.87v

**Starter relay socket (clutch interlock) multimeter test** 

In first key turn 0v to terminals 

In start key turn - 

1 = 11.55v

5 = 4.5v

3 = 0v

2 = 0v

7 = 0v

6 = 0 v

Inadequate power going through to relay socket. Why? i know the battery power is low but only because I keep trying to start the car. The battery is new and holds a charge otherwise. I keep reading about the NSS but find almost no information online about how to access or test this 

  
Any insight would be incredible"

2007 Ford Fusion transmission issue
2007 Ford Fusion Transmission issue.
TLDR: Transmission shifter seems to have shifted? There is no more park, in between reverse and park is reverse, reverse is neural, neutral is drive, drive is low? I think, and I have no idea what low is, probably neutral again. After I noticed something was wrong I put the car in park (at least tried to), and now the car won’t turn back on.
So I’m having some issues when I tried to leave for work this morning. The car turned on no problem, I let it warm up for a little bit and when I got ready to leave I put it in reverse but I noticed when I put it in reverse, it was actually neutral, the car wouldn’t move. So I moved the shifter up to put it back in park, and i found reverse in between park and reverse and the car did reverse like normal. When the car was in the neutral slot, it was in drive and moved normally, I assume drive was low but didn’t get far enough to test it. After I realized something was very wrong I parked the car back in my drive way and the car rolled like it was in neutral, I have blocks under the tires now to keep it from moving. At this point the car has no park, it won’t start because it’s not in park. I’m assuming something in the transmission linkage slipped or something and everything is just shifted slightly off but I have no idea what to check first. This is the 3rd problem I’ve had in like 2 weeks from my heat suddenly stop working in 0° weather to the couple month old wheel speed sensors dying randomly again. Needless to say I’m definitely frustrated and need some help with this one! Thank you!

P=Neutral
In between P and R=Reverse
R=neutral

1995 GMC Suburban won’t start, no crank, good battery
I have a 95 Suburban that won’t start. When I try to start it, the starter clicks once per key turn to ignition and the gauges flash and a clicking noise that sounds like a turn signal starts, will keep going for about 30 seconds, stop for about 2, then start again. This repeats itself 3 times. This cycle happens every time the key moves to an on position.

I’ve tested the battery with a multimeter, getting 13.7 volts after a 3 day charge with a wall charger and a reset of the connections. All dash lights, headlights, and radio work. There is a red light flashing under the instrument panel regardless of whether the key is in the truck. Only dash lights that stay lit when key is in are ‘Service Engine Soon’, ‘Check Gages’, and the battery light. 

I did recently perform a front left and right caliper/rotor/brake pad replacement if that makes a difference.

Thank you for reading all this, and I’d appreciate any advice."

Need Help Diagnosing Overheating and Starting Issues with My 2009 Pontiac Vibe AWD
Hi everyone,

I'm having some serious issues with my 2009 Pontiac Vibe AWD and could use some advice. Here's what's going on:

Symptoms Before Repair: Serpentine belt started squeaking a few days ago, then began smoking. The battery light came on, and the car wouldn’t drive at one point. I noticed the water pump pulley was seized, so I replaced the water pump and the serpentine belt.

Current Issues: After the repair, the car wouldn’t start—it just cranked and cranked. Eventually, it started after a lot of cranking and ran okay, but:

The coolant reservoir level stayed full, but I noticed the coolant bouncing around.

The temperature gauge spiked to ""H"" during a short drive, so I pulled over. There was coolant spilled in the engine bay, and a small puff of smoke came from the exhaust area.

On the way home, the temp gauge dropped to ""C,"" shot back up to ""H,"" and then fell to ""C"" again.


Other Details: When I removed the old water pump, no coolant spilled out.


Now the car cranks but won’t start again. Could this be air in the cooling system, a blown head gasket, or something else? There’s no milky oil, and the car drove fine (once it started) before the temp issues.

Any ideas or advice would be appreciated. Let me know if more details are needed!

Thanks in advance!

Big sister trying to help little brother with damages - 2017 Honda CR-Z

Hello! I hope this is the right sub to post this.

2017 Honda CR-Z

My little brother was victim of what we think was a catalytic converter theft attempt. It doesn’t seem like they were successful because when the car starts it doesn’t make the loud noise that Google suggested it would, but we aren’t car savvy so who really knows. It seems like they busted his drivers window, popped off the bumper and stole the headlight. But it’s hard to tell if anything else was damaged.

The issue? 

-He only has liability insurance so nothing is covered.  

-He only has $2500 for repairs 

What I’m hoping is this is something that can be made driveable. After doing a little research, the internet suggested that the Honda dealership won’t fix the headlight without repairing the bumper. So I’m wondering if he should contact an independent mechanic shop and ask if they are able to make it drivable with his budget. 

I’ve attached photos of the damage.

Thanks for your help! "

2004 Camry rough idle / acceleration 
2004 Camry rough idle / acceleration 

Hey guys 

Ive had no issues before but tonight as soon as I started the car it was having a rough idle & acceleration. Any gas and the car starts shaking immediately, if I’m stopped the engine seems like it’s going to stall but won’t quite get there. It struggles uphill & maintaining consistent power under acceleration, instead it shudders until I coast. Unfortunately I was forced to drive 15 minutes slowly keeping it under 2000 revs. Exhaust has always smelled a little rich but seems worse. 

I left the car overnight & will be back in the morning to read codes & take a better look in daylight. I’ll be checking oil too. 

Please let me know any details you need, I’ll do my best to provide. 

I’m guessing until I can read codes but feels to me like it would be something like a misfire because of the uneven idle.

Grinding noise on 2019 Sierra 2500. Any help?

I’m dealing with a brake issue & noise  on my truck, and I’d really appreciate some advice.
	•	It started with a grinding noise on the driver side, which is why I decided to replace the pads. There was actually plenty of life left on the pads. When I was working on it, I noticed one of the driver-side caliper pistons was stuck, so I figured that was the source of the noise. So I replaced the caliper as well.
	•	After replacing the caliper and installing new pads on both front wheels, the grinding noise is still there.
	•	Now, the truck pulls to the passenger side when I brake, and the pedal feels squishy. I’ll bleed it tonight. Haven’t yet. 
	•	The driver-side wheel won’t spin freely with the caliper installed, but the rotor spins perfectly when the caliper is removed. New one same issue. 

I haven’t bled the brakes yet, so I’m wondering if air in the lines could cause this or if it’s something else, like a collapsed brake hose, master cylinder, ABS module, or rotor issue.

Anyone have ideas on what to check next? Thanks in advance!

Rebuilt 93 Ford F150 5.8 Transmission now truck won’t start…

So I dropped it took it out and followed a man online that went through a step by step process of rebuilding the transmission. 

Before I put it back in I took the flywheel off and replaced the seal behind the flywheel. 

I then put it all back together and went to start the truck but the truck would only click and the starter would sound like it is engaging but not spinning.

Toyota Corolla 2007 not starting and making a buzzing sound.
A week ago, every time I turned on my car, it took longer than usual to start, but I thought it was due to the cold weather. Today, it just won’t start; there’s only a buzzing sound. I thought it could be the battery since it was old, so I replaced it, but it still won’t start, although I think the buzzing sound is a bit louder. I bought a code reader, and it showed code P2111. I checked the throttle plate, and it seems closed to me, though I didn’t check for dirt inside. The sound is coming from the area beneath the throttle actuator control system."

Car won’t start 
My 93 Honda Accord died on the road on the way to work. It started back up for a second but then died, now it'll turn over as long as I hold the keys, but won't start. 

I recently replaced the fuel pump and main relay, about a month ago and it’s been driving fine, and I can hear the pump engage when I turn the keys to start position. Also, the battery is getting 12v. Also, I filled it up with more gas (about 2 gal) to avoid the embarrassment of it just being lack of fuel, and it still won’t start. Could it be fuel lines? Or maybe alternator?

2008 mustang gt manual transmission can’t accelerate or rev the motor
Hello thank you for reading, I have a mustang I’ve been dealing with I got a new battery and new throttle body motor. It starts up perfect but the car won’t accelerate or rev up. I can push the throttle all the way down but nothing. It will however try to rev up by barely breaking 1k rpm then immediately dropping. And while that I think it’s trying to give itself gas if that makes sense. I have a broken hose that comes from the mass airflow to throttle body. My buddy says that should be the problem but I don’t know. I’ve included pictures, my finger is pointing where the hose goes into. Thank you for reading and any advice is appreciated.

2010 Ford Escape no start 
Hello Reddit! I’d like to see what you have to say. 

Recently, my 2010 Ford Escape v6 4wd with 170000 miles has had an intermittent starting issue. I’ll start the car on my first try, commute from work, cut the engine, and half the time it won’t start back up for another 4-6 hours. When I start it, there’s a click but no crank. Ive replaced the starter and battery. The weather here has been about + 90*F ever since this issue started. I just got a diagnostic test from a mechanic and he came back saying everything looks fine (no codes and the charging system is fine). There’s also an after market anti theft system on the car, but he said that shouldn’t be affecting it.  

I cannot figure this problem out. Any ideas???"

Vehicle won’t start after mechanic visit
My wife has a 95 Camry that was running, but shaking at idle. We brought it in to the shop, and he replaced the distributor cap and rotor as well as spark plugs. He also replaced a gasket (I think head gasket). 

Since we picked it up from the shop, after driving it home, the check engine light came on and it won’t start. The car would turn over fine, but not spark. I towed it to the shop, and there it wouldn’t even turn over (including if jumped). He connected the battery to something else on the car (idk what he did) and it would turn over but not start again. 

He’s claiming ignition switch is out, and is saying this is a coincidence that the vehicle is having a new problem 1 day after he worked on it. Do you all have any ideas what’s going on here?

I just got a quote for some repairs on my 2017 jeep grand Cherokee, and I’m curious if I’m being ripped off. 

Some context: I was driving my car a few days ago, and the engine shut off randomly while the car was moving and in drive. The car won’t start without a jump start. Once I jump, the car works fine, it just won’t start back up again without a jump. I took it into a Jeep dealership, and they’re saying that both the main and auxiliary batteries need to be replaced, and the main fuse array was entirely shorted, so they need to replace the whole fuse box. 

They quoted me ~$2000. Is this reasonable? I understand I’m gonna be paying more at a dealership compared to a local shop, but barring that, is this a somewhat normal price? Or should I look elsewhere? Lastly, based on what I’ve said, do these recommended repairs make sense?"

Car won’t start occasionally
Hey there!

I have a 2011 Hyundai Sonata that I love!
Most of the time it’s great, but occasionally it won’t crank.
I can get the air and radio to turn on by using the battery but it won’t crank all the way.
I’m stuck sitting wherever I’m at for anywhere between 5 and 25 minutes before I can finally get it going again.

What does this mean?"

2001 sante fe won’t start
I have a 2001 sante fe that I received from a friend for free and I’m trying to fix it up to sell it. When I got it the car would only start if I jumped it so I thought the battery was bad. It was a 5 year old battery so it made sense. Went and bought a new battery and installed it and got nothing… tired jumping the car with the new battery and nothing. Ended up putting the old battery in and tried jumping and got nothing. Anyone have any idea what the issue could be? "

Is my electrical system messed up?
I have a 2014 Mazda CX-5 that didn’t start today (was working fine on my trip to the grocery store yday) and I tried to jump it with cables without success. My neighbor came out with a portable jump starter so I took him up on his offer. He connected it to an outlet on his house and we connected it and powered it up. I saw one spark, but not sure where it came from. Car didn’t start the first go, it did start the second go. However, when it started, engine codes p061b and p0102 came up as well as a flashing tire pressure light. I tried to drive it but it kept stumbling/kicking when accelerating so I stopped. I turned the car off and on again without any issue, but CEL was still on and tire pressure lights were still flashing. I’m worried that the jump start blew my circuit or messed up the electrical system some how…. There was significant corrision on the battery terminals and I will get the battery replaced and terminals cleaned, but I’m worried that won’t solve the issue and it’s a wiring or electrical issue that will require further check-up. Any insights?

EDIT: So I replaced the battery and cleaned the terminals which did not resolve any codes or lights. Can’t clear codes either. Looks like a possible MAF sensor issue. Ran engine and unplugged the MAF sensor, which did not kill the engine. Has anyone had any troubles with MAF sensors after a jump start? Am I on the right track?

Update: it was the MAF sensor! Replaced it with a new OEM part today and it ran like it did before. Wondering if the jumpstart somehow blew out the MAF sensor."

2008 Lexus IS-F won’t start
Hey all, have run into an issue with my IS-F this morning, which is essentially the same as the video below.

I changed my taillights out for a set of VLAND lights last night, and mistakenly tried testing them out while the engine wasn't running and built a lot of pressure up in the brake lines to the point the brake is incredibly stiff to push. My brake lights work fine, however the car does not recognise that I'm pushing on the brake to start the car.

Has anyone experienced anything similar? I have tried pushing down hard on the brake to start the car, tried jumping the car, disconnecting the battery, putting the old taillights in to no avail.

2012 Chevy Equinox won’t start and I’m at my wits end
Howdy folks, as I said the 2012 Equinox simply did not start in the morning. Drove fine the previous day. 
Won't even crank or click. 

- Interior electrical works perfectly 
- battery was tested and showing 12.7 volts
- starter was replaced 
- VVT solenoids both replaced
- reset computer by draining charge for 30 mins connecting red/black terminals 

The OBD2 gave a P0013 code which is why both solenoids were replaced and the code was cleared. 
The most confounding part is that no matter what I do, I get absolutely ZERO response from the engine. All the dash lights work, radio, trunk opening assist...everything works okay except when I turn the key...nothing. 

I was certain a full reset would do the trick but it's done nothing. Any other suggestions? "

Quoted $2500 for 2015 Nissan Rogue S ECM replacement - is that typical? 
Disclaimer: I know very little about cars but I’m learning as I go and trying my best. Any and all advice is highly appreciated! 

I recently got my 2015 Nissan Rogue S towed to my local dealer for service because the battery was completely drained after not driving it for a few weeks (don’t need a lecture lol like I said, learning as I go). The battery was replaced under warranty as it was replaced in March 2023 before this (for seemingly no reason according to the dealer, the battery simply went bad). I go to pick it up and they give me the key and my key won’t work. I use a spare key to unlock the car (which does work) and it won’t start with either key. The batteries in both sets of keys are fine, they checked them. They take the car back in and I get a call today saying they need to replace my Engine Control Module and that it will be $2500. The car is worth ~$8000 so that would be crazy to spend considering it’s not even guaranteed to fix the car (as you can see, I have no trust that it will be fixed this time either). 

At this point, my only option is to sell it. The car has ~67,000 miles on it (I’ve only put ~27,000 miles on it since I bought it certified pre owned from Nissan in 2020). It has been routinely maintenanced, never missed an oil change, and never even had a light come on the dash for any reason. I have always had it serviced at Nissan by their technicians, and always had the maintenance they recommend done on it.  This all just seems a little out of the blue. I feel like all of the money I’ve put into making sure this car lasts was all for nothing and I don’t know what I did wrong for this to just happen. 

I looked up the average price of an ECM replacement, and it’s about $1000 less than what I’ve been quoted on the high end of the averages I’ve seen. Now obviously, the price of $2500 may be specific to my make and model or just my car. I want so badly to trust the dealers quote, but I just want to double check. $1000 is a big difference (and not one I am able to pay right now!). Any advice would be great, thanks in advance!

Having trouble finding a mechanic
My car is a 2016 Ford flex with about 160,000 miles on it. The head gasket went out about two weeks ago. It won’t start and it won’t run so I had a mobile mechanic come out and look at it to do the diagnosis. He had initially agreed to do the job for about $2500. However, he canceled a few days before hand and said that he wouldn’t be able to do the job.

I have since called around to a number of different repair shops and also mobile repair companies. 

I’ve heard a number things from all the different shops that I’ve called.

1.  Some say that they’re willing to do it and then quote me a price which is far above but my research says it should cost.

2. Several have said that they won’t do it on a vehicle with this many miles because it’s just going to have even more problems down the line.  Instead they recommend just getting a rebuilt engine installed for $7000-10,000

3.  One guy told me that I should just buy a new car.

4.  I have one guy who said he’s willing to do it. I am a little bit skeptical about his capabilities.  His business is new, although he says that he’s done head gaskets on several other types of vehicle’s.

Is it really that problematic to do a head gasket repair? Several shops that I have called I have made it seem like 150,000 is a really high number of miles and that I should just expect an engine to die by that point.

I am a bit stressed out and frustrated, because so many people are pushing me towards a much more expensive option that I don’t think I can afford.

Finicky Starter Problems
2005 Toyota camry 4 cylinder, 190,000 miles.

Bottom line on top: Yesterday, in Central Texas we had a big storm with a ton of water. My car wouldn’t start. Today, it started just fine. i didn’t change anything. I think it might be an issue with the cable but i’m also considering replacing the starter (again).

I had to repair my starter recently due to oil damage.

When repairing, it didn’t seem to be starting. then, all of a sudden, it worked. i don’t know exactly what I changed. but i think it might have been related to jostling the battery to starter cable.

Last summer, the car got hot and it ruined the alternator and battery corrosion ate through the terminal, which caused me to replace it with the nickel battery terminal thats in the picture.

Now, we had a huge storm yesterday and the car wouldn’t start, specifically the starter wasn’t working (all of the lights turned on just fine and it wasn’t doing that thing were the starter is going but the engine won’t turn.i even tried jumping it) but now it is starting again. the rust on the terminal is completely new. i’m going to rebuild the cable, but is there anything else i should look at?"

Our car (2011 Hyundai Sonata with 2.4 L 4-cylinder engine and just over 105K miles) has been working fine (no symptoms that we ignored or anything…no noises, fluid leakage, reduced gas mileage, etc.). When my husband tried to go to work this morning, it wouldn’t start. 

We had it towed, but I’m curious as to what it might be. I thought maybe the starter or alternator, but the noise he heard doesn’t match any of the sounds I heard in the videos I watched. Here’s how he described it:

What it sounded like was it went chunk like you’re slamming two rocks together then it went dead so I turned off and did it again made the same noise turned it off and did it a third time it went chunk and then it sound like a flywheel out of control somewhere deep in the engine that’s what it sounded like

He was talking to text, so sorry for the lack of punctuation.

One of those mysteries. Not even the official VW repair shop knows how to fix this…
My 2007 VW Passat 2.0 TDi 170cv (BMR engine) 180.000km (112.000 miles) has a problem. 
Now and again, not very frequently, when I try to start it, it won’t. The engine cranks but doesn’t start. After 1-2 minutes continuously cranking it finally starts running normally, not without making huge vibrations, roughness and showing some warnings (AFS not working and/or oil pressure low) but once it starts running these behaviors and warnings disappear.


This happens about once every 2 months, either being the engine cold or warm. It has also happened after the engine inexplicably going off while idling.


The mechanics from the official VW repair shop can’t find any problem related to this.
No fault codes, normal values in the injectors, warming coils ok, timing belt changed last month (and yet it happened again today).


I have already checked the anti-shudder valve, and it remains open while starting the engine even when these abnormal events occur. 


My hope is that the problem is related to the accessories belt (alternator, A/C, etc), since when changing the timing belt the mechanics found it to be a bit worn out and the tensor gets a bit stuck. Can it be it?


What can be happening that we are all missing? 

I really don’t know how to solve this issue. Help is much appreciated.

Car still won’t start Kia sedona 06
Here again after buying a new starter again and replacing again unlike last time when it ran for threee days then stopped this time it won’t run at all: would like to add that when I pulled the starter out I did notice that I had pinched a wire causing it to melt a bit so when I replaced it with no wire pinched I expected for it to just start and be fine but nope no hope. Any help would be appreciated. Now a few other things for context. We replaced the ignition switch and the starter relay as well. One more thing I saw some where that the neutral safety switch would stop it from starting and the solution to that was to put it into neutral and started to see if it would start and when I did that all the lights in the car and dash shut off like I had disconnected the battery and have yet to come back on. Even after hooking the car up to my car. Does that ring any bells for anyone

Trying to start car after sitting for 7 months.
Just put a new battery in my 2014 Hyundai Elantra  gt because it died after sitting for about 7 months. After starting, the car quickly started to vibrate and the check engine light came on. I’m thinking the gas was bad and now my fuel injectors need to be replaced and possibly the fuel pump filter. I’m not that mechanical when it comes to cars but figure this is good practice.

My question is, how can I drain the fuel line to remove the injectors if the gas that’s in it is bad. I see I have to remove the fuse to the pump then syphon the gas out. But won’t running the gas that’s already in the line hurt the car even more? Or will the amount of fuel that’s already in the line not really do any damage?"

Infiniti g37x won’t start
So as the title says I have a 2011 Infiniti g37x that won’t start. The battery seems to be working fine (I can turn the headlights on and off and interior lights seem to be functioning).

Is the issue likely the alternator? If so is that an easy fix that I can do myself or will I have to get it taken to a shop (I’m pretty green with anything car related so I wouldn’t back myself on anything too complicated)?

Car will start and stay running as long as I’m pressing on the gas. I can even shift and take off if I don’t let it get all the way down to idle. The second it gets all the way down, it dies.

09’ BMW 328i not starting. New alternator, starter, and battery.
I have been working on this BMW for some time now. The car wouldn’t start and all signs pointed to the starter. It was replaced and it worked fine for 2-3 months. Then after driving for awhile it would begin to turn off randomly and wouldn’t start back for 30ish mins (the car was also roughly idling at this time) so we changed a bad coil pack and did all the spark plugs. Because the car sat for awhile in between repairs the battery died and wouldn’t hold a charge. It was replaced and we also replaced the alternator. AS OF RIGHT NOW all lights in the vehicle turn on when the key is engaged but won’t turn over. For some reason when we tap on the alternator lightly the car cranks right up. I can not connect the dots here, if anyone has any ideas please let me know. List of the current repairs below.

They diagnosed my truck and said it was an issue with my trucks ignition switch and would cost $700 to fix. Got my truck back and everything was fine for a week and then the same issue keeps happening. Clearly the fix didn’t fix and I’m pissed.

So I’m trying to figure out what I should do next. I’ve tried calling the dealership mechanic but it seems every time I call the guy is away and will call me back. I plan to call again to talk to the manager but should I ask for a refund/chargeback on my credit card or have them fix it again?"

Paid over $2k to get a/c fixed, pressure blows low. Help?
Year/make/model: 2004 Mercury Grand Marquis

Pre-work condition of A/C: The air was randomly changing from blowing out of the front vents to the floor vents, to the defrost vents. After some time of doing this, the compressor ended up seizing/burning up and smoke and burnt rubber smell was coming out. The a/c was unusable for about two months until I took it into my trusted mechanic.

Diagnosis: The compressor and condenser needed to be replaced. The system needed to be flushed. The switch/dial area responsible for changing where the a/c was coming out of needed to be replaced(they ordered an after market part for this).

Post-repair: The pressure of the a/c was very low. Like, it was a soft caress of my face, sometimes barely reaching my face. It SUCKED and it was a huge let down because before this all broke, the a/c was strong as hell and ice cold. I could blast it for 30 seconds and then already be cold. It was great. What I got back was cold but nothing like it should be, and the defrost wasn’t even able to work well because the pressure wasn’t very strong. It would defrost in bands rather than the whole windshield.

After I got home from picking up the car, I had to call back and explain the issue. They understood and said I could drop the car back off and any work would be under the warrantee of the parts and labor just done. They hold my car for 8 days, telling me that the mechanic has to start from square 1 again because sometimes the compressor comes with oil filled too high, so he had to drain and refill it to improve performance. I also requested that a used switch head(can’t remember the name) that controlled the dials of the a/c be used instead of the after market part because the dial that increased and decreased the air flow was not working right. After the 8 days, they gave me back $146 dollars which I guess was the difference for the used part being swapped. Mind you, I paid $2300 for all this to be fixed initially.

I ask my mechanic liaison if the pressure is stronger. I don’t get a straight “yes”, I get a bunch of talk about how the temp goes down to the 40’s. My wife picks up the car and won’t tell me how she feels about it. The shit is the SAME PRESSURE. Just better dial control and maybe slightly colder. 

If they replaced almost every component related to the A/C, what in the hell could be preventing the air from blowing as strong as it used to? I know the mechanic is short staffed. But I was out of a car for a collective 14 days or so, and I feel like maybe the guy working on it just doesn’t know what the issue is with the blower. Help?"

Body Shop Trouble - Feeling Stuck Please Help
I bought a 2016 Land Rover Discovery Sport HSE that was well taken care of with great service records. I was originally hesitant since it was a Land Rover but the Ford engine and well documented service records won me over.

The second week I had it someone cut into my lane on the interstate and slammed on the breaks. They were an illegal citizen and had no insurance leaving me to deal with mine. Vehicle had lower bumper damage, the intercooler was damaged/leaking, and needed other replacement parts. Due to the type of vehicle something simple ended up being $10,000. Insurance accepted the quote and allowed the work to proceed.

The body shop has almost finished the work they needed to do. Part of the work they did, which I didn’t approve of but I didn’t get a say in it, was to replace the front wiring harness and bumper parking sensors. They’ve done most of the work minus 2-3 parts they planned to do.

Today they call and say the vehicle is now stuck in reverse and they can don’t know what to do. They can cut the car off but will not be able to crank it again due to the issue. I explained that I bought the vehicle two weeks prior with a detailed mechanical overview the dealership performed before I took it home and I never had a problem with it. They tried to get me to say I had issues prior but I never had any issues prior and they’ve moved it around for 2 weeks during this time fixing it without issue. 

They end up saying they aren’t authorized/able to work on electronics for Land Rover (even though they quoted and agreed to install a wiring harness and sensors, then quoted an electronics reset after completing repairs). I called my insurance agent who said he would address it. He called later to tell me he couldn’t prove it was their fault and was having the vehicle taken to Land Rover for an estimate since they can’t work on it. If the cost was too high based on repairs then it would be written off. I pled my case to him that this should fall on the body shop 100% because of the original  mechanical inspection prior to owning and it never happened until they’ve moved it multiple times. Not to mention they have messed with electronics on the vehicle but claim they can’t work on electronics.

What can I do here? Do I just have to eat this because I can’t prove fault or is there some way to get this addressed properly? I feel so stuck, car is so close to coming back home and then this happens. I understand things break and stuff happens but based on the circumstances I feel like it’s the body shops fault and no one else seems too. Please help!

TLDR: Car taken to body shop due to light front end damage on passenger side. Body shop starts repairing and does electronic wiring harness in front plus sensors. Car gets stuck in reverse and body shop says they can’t work on electronics/not certified for Land Rover electronics. Also says it’s not their fault even though they’ve been the only ones moving it for 2 weeks. Insurance agrees they can’t prove fault and I’m stuck in limbo where I may have it totaled if repair at Land Rover is too high. Feeling stuck, what to do (I don’t want it totaled and can’t afford for it to be totaled.)"

2010 BMW 535i 5 series, OBD2 Scanner Communication Error; NO ISSUES with ECU and CAS, wiring and pins look good according to mechanic?
Sent out my ECU, CAS and key to a company for a diagnosis just to hear back that nothing is wrong with them. My mechanic is stumped and says that the wiring and pins look fine, but admits that they can look that way but not actually be fine at all. Any ideas? 

ADDITIONAL CONTEXT:

Engine light is on, but not sure what the fault codes are because of the communication error. The car won’t start, and mechanic just recently replaced the low pressure fuel pump and the fuse for that fuel pump. Replaced valve cover gasket and front main seal. It was working fine but then a week later after the replacement of the fuel pump, car began to sputter, lose power and from there, it doesn’t start. Low pressure fuel pump still primes. OBD connector has power, but no communication.

2013 Camry starter issue
2013 Camry 4cylinder 130k miles 

About a month ago my car began having issues starting. I opened up my hood when it wouldn’t start once and wiggled the positive battery terminal and it started. I figured the terminal would need replacing soon. A couple days ago it wouldn’t start again, even when I messed with the terminal, so I replaced the positive terminal and found it was pretty corroded and broken at one point. I figured that would fix it.

 However, it still won’t start. I get accessory lights and A/C and headlights turn on full power. I tested my battery and its showing 12.4V. I tried again to start it today and it worked but it was struggling real bad to turn over. I decided then to test the battery while it was running and it showed 14V which makes me think it’s not the battery. It sat for a couple hours and won’t start anymore. I hear a click when I turn the key indicative of a bad starter. 

I decided to take the starter out and took it to get bench tested. First two big box auto stores said it was fine and passed but one gentlemen said it was spinning rather slow. The third place I took it to was an indie mechanic and the first time he hooked it up it locked up and wouldn’t spin, but seemingly worked fine the second time he tried. He then tried to sell me a replacement starter. 

I’m thinking that the starter could’ve passed the first two bench tests after I moved it around a ton while removing it, and ultimately failed the third test from its faults. 

I just wanted to see if anyone had any other ideas before I try to go ahead and replace the starter."

How difficult is it to replace a starter?
My 2007 Toyota Corolla won’t start. The battery was just replaced about 2 months ago. It won’t start with a jump either. I am thinking it’s the starter (if anyone else has a different opinion please let me know!). My friend has some experience with cars and says he could fix it. Is it relatively simple to fix a starter issue? What parts would he need to do it?

UPDATE: thank you all for the advice. I’m glad my friend did some investigation like people suggested. Turned out to be dirty battery terminals. After cleaning it starts up and runs fine. So far so good!"

Having electrical issues
Car won’t start sometimes without being jumped, this happened a few times. It would also shut down when parked. I tested the battery and it said full, so I’m thinking it’s the connection. I scrubbed down the inside of the connector and the outside of the battery lug, was covered in slime, but its still happening. The car runs just fine except for this. Does this connector look corroded? Or is it the battery, alternator, something else? Any general advice is appreciated. 2008 Suzuki Grand Vitara."

Car won’t start up the first time I try?
I have a jeep Cherokee that was working fine Thursday night (it is up for a oil change which I planned to do this week before it stopped working). Friday morning, it wouldn’t start, the battery was showing low voltage and there was new corrosion on the battery that wasn’t there before. We scrapped off the corrosion and  had it jumped started. It started up right away. Sat it in to keep the battery and engine going for 45 minutes. Tried driving it later in the day and it didn’t start up the first time. It started up the 3rd time pressing in the push start. Didn’t start up again the first time at the gas station I took it to after driving for a bit. And the issue has persisted. Got the battery and alternator checked out at auto zone but they said it all looked good. Any idea what this could be? Or how I can fix it before tomorrow? There are no auto repair shops with openings until late this week and I work everyday. Thanks for the help!

2015 Jeep Cherokee Brake Help
Hi There!

I’m a very lightly experienced car owner (read: I took auto shop in high school and know the absolute basics but make no claims on knowing all there is to know about my car). 

I’ve had my 2015 Jeep Cherokee since it was new. I have about 133,000 miles on it. I feel like my brakes are wearing down/having issues more frequently than they should. My suspicion is that I keep winding up with cheaper brakes that wear faster (my rims are covered in black brake dust all the time). 

Currently my front brakes shake a bit and have just started to squeak a bit, so I know it’s time to get some work done. The rotors were cut and pads replaced on my front brakes in Sept 2022 and those are the ones that have started squeaking now. 

I’d like to buy a set of decent rotors and pads for my car to have my mechanic put on that won’t wear so easily. 

So I’m looking for 2 things:
1. A recommendation for a decent brand of pads/rotors I can buy that won’t wear as quickly as the cheaper ones I’ve had. 
2. Any thoughts on why my brakes might be wearing so quickly? (I realize this one is much tougher to diagnose but while I’m here I figured I’d ask). 

Thanks in advance!"

I thought it was the fuel pump but it isn’t… ‘09 Pontiac Vibe
‘09 Pontiac Vibe - 2WD - 1.8L - 100k miles
Hey all, I have an ‘09 Pontiac Vibe that is nearly turning over but won’t. It’ll try and try and almost sound like it’s about to start but won’t. 

I checked all the fuses, all good, and that lead me to the fuel pump, which wasn’t making any noise. I disconnected the hose to the fuel pump and there was no pressure. I tested power cable to the fuel pump and it was reading 13V. Bingo! Fuel pump must be broken…

Today I replaced the fuel pump and alas same problem! Except when I removed the fuel line it sprayed me in the face! Never been so happy to be covered in gasoline.

So my question is: what do I try next? Why won’t this thing start?

UPDATE: FIXED! It turns out I just had to press on the gas pedal while starting. Maybe the pump needed some help getting primed. Thanks everyone!!"

Chevy Equinox 2016 - What’s my next step?
So my Chevy equinox won’t start. Tried to turn the key and I’m not getting anything, no noise clicks just silence. Lights all came on just fine, no dimming to be seen, and no problems up until today. Took the battery out, took it to AutoZone to get tested, they said it’s fine. Put the battery back in, all the dash lights came back on, then they didn’t. 

Now she’s dead in the water, double checked my hook up on the battery, all is fine. Tried to jump it using my Ford Focus, lights and such came on while connected. But can’t turn the key and get anything. So I noticed a light on the dash giving me anti-theft notification. 

Okay maybe it’s not turning over because of the anti-theft. Read something about switching it between park and neutral back and forth. Read something about using the physical key on the door. Tried both, the park to neutral let me fully press down on the break, but the anti-theft light is still on, and won’t click, turn over, anything. 

Disconnected the other battery, from the Equinox. Back to dead in the water, no lights or anything. 

Honestly, if you can’t tell I have no idea what I’m doing, but I’m trying to figure it out. It seems I’ve only gone backwards at this point though. Looking for some guidance from a helpful soul."

Dispute regarding insufficient repair
This takes place in Denmark 

My parents were driving our Volkswagen 1.6 TDI on the way to a vacation when the car broke down, we delivered it to a Volkswagen workshop and they ran a diagnose and figured out it was a fuel diesel injector. They told us it would be a couple weeks until they could repair it (ordering the part) and it would cost around 1350 euro. They call the next day and tell us the car is ready to be picked up and it would now cost 1000 euro. They didn’t explain to us the reason for the big price change nor the fact that they got the part same day delivery. So now they’re driving home and again the car breaks down with the same light shining in the speedometer area. We deliver it to another workshop and they tell us it’s another fuel diesel injector right next to the one the other workshop repaired. So now we are currently having a dispute with Volkswagen after the first workshop which they (the workshop) deemed to be not their fault. We also learned that the first workshop installed a FTZ diesel injector and not a genuine part without our consent. Our questions are as follows

1. We learned that in order to repair 1 diesel injector you must also remove the one next to it, which the workshop admitted to doing. Why didn’t they run a diagnosis on the other one if it is necessary to remove it? IMO it’s very straightforward the fault is in their hands for removing one and not running proper tests 

2. We learned that the tests they ran (error code reader and multimeter) to figure out the problem on the diesel injectors were basic but not enough to deeply diagnose them, why didn’t they run a deeper test?

3. Should a workshop inform the customer before installing a non OEM injector instead of a genuine VW part?

4. Is it acceptable for the workshop to discard both the removed injector and the packaging of the new one without informing us?

5. If a second injector fails short time after the first was replaced, does it indicate poor diagnostics during the first visit?"

Charging completely dead battery
I have a 2010 Volvo S80 that broke down and had been sitting on my driveway for months while I figured out what to do with it and life happened- ofcourse the battery is completely dead.

I want to scrap the car, but it has an electronic parking break which I need to disengage to have it moved; I tried charging the battery with a ""Smart battery charger"" (Halfords Advanced 4A Smart Charger), directly connecting it to the leads of the battery, but it keeps showing a ""no/bad connection"" icon. This suggests the voltage of the battery may be too low for the smart charger to even detect it.

What is my best alternative? Could I jump  the battery using my other car to get enough power in the system to disengage the parking break? Ideally I wouldn't swap the battery with the battery from my other car, mainly as I already found disconnecting the battery from the Volvo a bit difficult..."

Deep thud on cold start
2016 Mercedes c450 93k miles
The car has never broke down or not started, it still performs to the same level as when I got it, I keep up with the maintenance, I do tend to have a heavy foot (but it’s a fun car and I can’t resist), but overall I consider the car to be in good condition.
However, about a month ago….
On cold start and only cold start, a single deep thud is heard from inside the car. Sounds like it is coming from the engine bay. RPMs drop by about 50 in the moment of this thud then recovers. Occasionally there will be another thud, a couple seconds after the first one.
I was seeing some posts about the possibility of it being a flywheel, misfire, carbon build up in the engine, fuel injector, and just a multitude of things that MAY be the problem.
I took it to the shop to see if someone with significantly more knowledge than me could figure it out, but they couldn’t. They want to take out the engine to get a better look and they said, depending on what they find, it could cost me around $16k USD.
Which is funny, because I don’t even know if I can sell the car for $16k lol.
I greatly appreciate anyone who can give me advice on whether I should invest in replacing a part that might fix it (but risk losing more money if it doesn’t) or just call it and sell the car. I wouldn’t mind spending up to $1k on replacing parts with the chance to fix the problem, but only if it’s not a lost cause yet.
Thanks!"

No brake fluid out one new caliper.
So I am at the end of a frustrating brake job. I’ve been working on my own vehicles since I could drive so ~20 years. This job included 3 new calipers. It really only needed 2 but I broke the bleeder on one of the old ones so that’s where the 3rd comes from. The passenger front isn’t getting any brake fluid from the bleeder. The master cylinder and abs module are both on the driver side under the hood. So I bled the rear passenger, rear driver in that order and everything went fine. When I got to the passenger front, nothing. I haven’t tried the driver side front yet as I don’t want to mess up the order. The new calipers are both rear and the passenger front. Any ideas?

Edit:
Figured it out. Brake pedal was stiff as expected from doing the rears so I just ended up saying bleep it, had the wife start the car and push the pedal down, cracked the bleeder and fluid came out. Standard bleed after that. Thanks for everybody’s suggestions. "

Wrong rabbit hole?
2000 Ford Focus 2.0L. The facts:

\-Just started driving the car a couple weeks ago.....acted weird when trying to start it

\-Added a 5oz bottle of STP full injector cleaner to the tank by recommendation...no fuel ratio anything on the bottle. Dumb? Blind? Both? Probably.

\-Car immediately started acting like it was flooded and would stall after starting in neutral AND either when I was already in neutral coasting to a stop or downshifting preparing to slow down or stop.

\-Topped off the tank.....turns out I have a bad floating fuel gauge needle so I put that whole bottle in on 3 gallons of gas and not the 3/4 tank I thought I had

\-Dogged it for a few hours to try and knock some of the junk loose and burn off some of the STP

\-Next day it started fine but started stalling again after it warmed up

\-Code reader said the system was too rich and gave me an o2 sensor fault

\-Replaced o2 sensor, no more rich system, no faults.....ran better but still stalling

\-Engine still ran like it was choking so I replaced the fuel filter

\-Ran perfect for 2 days until the fuel level got lower then it started stalling again

\-Topped the fuel off but unfortunately the serpentine belt broke so I didn't get a chance to see if it helped

\-Replaced the belt and drove it a bit.......still stalling and I was now misfiring on cylinders 1 and 2

\-I was going to anyways so I replaced the spark plugs, the wires, and the ignition coil today.....still....stalling

So I guess the question is is the stalling from too much undiluted STP still in the system? Seems like the only things that made an actual difference were topping off the tank and changing the fuel filter. The ignition stuff needed to be done so it would've happened anyways but I was hoping it would make a little difference. Do I stop chasing a problem that might not be there and just let the STP run its course or could it be something else? I just got the car and was planning on putting a bunch of work into it regardless, but it would be nice to narrow it down. Running stop signs while I'm stalled out turning a corner with no power steering then popping the clutch in 2nd to start back up stopped being fun real quick.

Car broke down twice while traveling abroad
I’m currently traveling with my family and we’re far from home. After two long driving days (about 8 hours each), our car (Jeep Compass, 5 years old) broke down just an hour before reaching our destination. We suddenly got a dashboard message saying ‘Check engine/transmission’ and ‘start/stop not available’, and shortly after that, the engine just stopped while we were on the highway.

We were in a foreign country, in 37°C heat, with two small kids in the back. It was a pretty terrifying experience.

We managed to get a tow truck (very stressful trying to arrange that in another language), had the car taken to a garage, and got a taxi to our destination. When we went back, the garage told us they had run a diagnostic and took the car for a 30 km test drive but couldn’t find anything wrong.

The car ran fine for two more days, and then tonight… same issue again. Same warning message, same breakdown.

Has anyone experienced something similar? I want to make sure I ask the right questions when it gets towed again. Could the extreme heat (37°C) be playing a role here? Any ideas or suggestions would be hugely appreciated."

I feel the vibrations coming from the wheels or engine bay (somewhere front and below) and its like driving on a wavy gravel road. At 60kmph (just when it goes from 3rd to 4th gear) the load on the engine is very low but the shake becomes a bit horizontal, where it's otherwise vertical. When changing the amount of throttle the shake reduces, when the speed is increased by a few mph the shake goes away. When driving very lightly, and putting very low stress on the car (50kmph, its a bit unnoticeable that it's shaky. The gears don't feel to be slipping, shifts feel very smooth (but have to wait like 5 minutes in the morning until transmission oil lubricates it. If not, it won't go from 1st to 2nd so smoothly. This is also an issue I need to address, but when in hot/operating temperature, its smooth, I ignored it for now since its old age). Other than the shakyness the acceleration is relatively very good.

Things I've tried/current condition:

* New/Good condition engine mounts (replaced all 3, 11 months ago)
* New tyres (all four) (Less older than 1 year)
* new cv joints (as I've had clicking noise before when turning)
* new ball joints
* new lower arm bushings
* new tie rods end,
* Wheel alignment, Wheel balancing (after the front suspension repair)
* Relatively new \~5000km transmission oil on my second transmission (since the first one started slipping and broke down), which I flushed and refilled after fixing the oil seals
* new engine oil (ran 20km with new oil)
* spark plugs look good (correctly combusted or something) and don't feel any misfires
* New brake rotors/disks, New FBL brake pads (it did the shakes before and after the brakes, no difference)
* Good front shock absorbers, shock mounts, but bad/old rear shock absorbers and shock mounts.
* Axles or shafts are not bent or anything
* No wheel bearing noise or any suspension noise/clicking/ticking, generally nothing front suspension-related has any unwanted play

Thank you in advance for your opinion/advice on this

  
Edit: I currently suspect my torque converter :("

How do I get this out (1.6HDI)?
My dipstick broke off the other day when i was checking my oil, I went straight to 11, removing the sump but  the dipstick wasn't in there (I had drained the oil into a can through a filter so i was confident it wasn't in there). Whacked out the endoscope today (yeah I should've done that first...) and its deep inside the dipstick hole.

Cant find anything about where this comes out in the block in my haynes manual. New dipstick was supposed to arrive today but hasn't yet so I cant jam it down with that - ziptie also didn't work, just flexed (as did the endoscope). "

Issue with shop/warranty for 2007 Hyundai Tucson
Hi car folks!

So my dilemma is this:  

My Tucson had its engine replaced in 2022 by a small local shop. The engine replacement came with a 5 year or 50k Mile Parts & Labor warranty. I have the invoice from said replacement and am well within the set parameters.

Almost a month ago, my Tucson broke down on the highway. Had it towed to the same small local shop, they said it was the timing belt and that we still had the warranty on our engine. Okay, cool. Except the shop manager cannot find the warranty info. She didn't put the company on any of the invoices and can't seem to find any of the paperwork/emails/anything. For almost a month this woman has been ""looking"" for my warranty paperwork, or anything that could point her to where the engine came from.  


For three weeks+ she's been ducking my calls and when I do get ahold of her she gives me ""I haven't had a chance to check this other storage area yet"" and the cycle continues. 

Today I marched my ass across town on foot and showed up, asking for a plan. Her plan is to have her guys replace the timing belt and ""see if that works"" and to my understanding, chances are low of that being enough. She refused to entertain the idea of not finding the warranty and assured me she will find it. 


Tl;dr- shop lost my warranty on an engine they replaced, it busted and now they can't find the warranty info to utilize said warranty to fix my shit.


What are my options here? What if she can't find the warranty info? Is this normal???  Any help is appreciated, I'm losing my mind.

New Replacement Window Regulator Not Working/Powering?
Got a 2007 Honda Pilot. Driver side front power window regulator broke. I can hear the motor spinning but window doesn’t go up or down. That’s fine, I go into AutoZone grab a new one (part: Duralast Window Motor and Regulator Assembly 748-129). I follow the Youtube video/tutorial linked. I connect the new regulator but don’t attach it to my window and door yet just to make sure it works first. I then connect the switch for the buttons/controls turn my car on, and I try to roll it up, but the motor doesn’t spin and nothing is moving up, nor down. I can control the other power windows on my car. Am I missing something?? Thank you in advance! "

Jeep 2009 jk bad tipm possibly?
Hey, so its been a few years since ive asked the internet for detailed help, so bear with me. 
I also dont know if this is the right place to post this. 
Background on me is i have worked as a mechanic, every vehicle ive owned in the past 10 years has had atleast one motor swap done by me. 
I own a 2009 wrangler x 3.8 manual. Been a daily for about 5 years. 338k, desperately needed head gaskets so I rebuilt another motor. On the way to swap it in, I had an alternator light. I didnt think too hard about it. Got it to the shop with the new motor, swapped it in. Got it started to a p0335 code, crank position sensor wiring (i broke this clip taking it out and needed to rewire) also had bank 2 o2 sensor ground codes (dont remember the numbers) so checked grounds.
Went to put it back on the lift. Suddenly battery light is back on. Then it dies. Then the battery is dead. 
Weird but I swapped another battery on it. Get nothing. No crank no key, nothing inside the car works. 
Check voltage and its 5v. Which doesnt make sense. Check orignal battery its 11v. 
Check the alternator and its burning hot, and the alternator wire is also burning hot. Unplug the alternator, also the starter, assuming I have a pinched hot somewhere. Cant find one. Track down my power draw to the fuse box. 
Nothing is blown in it, and if I unplug all the big plugs on the bottom the draw goes away. So as best as I can understand the draw is in the ""tipm"" which is like the fusebox and bcm, in one. 

Is there something else I could be missing? This is my daily and i would really like to figure it out. 

Thanks for reading and thanks in advance for any input "

2002 Buick LeSabre shutting down mid-turn. HELP
So, we are being evicted for nonpayment of 17 months worth of rent (LOL) by a section 8 housing organization that was just under investigation for fraud.. 🤔 (our money orders are not traceable either, they're open ended and have never been deposited anywhere within the last 3 to 17 months, so it sounds like embezzlement. Unfortunately for me, we did lose a few monry order receipts over the past 17 months so... we are inevitably going to lose.) 

Anyways, my court date is in just a few days and I have a car broken down in my backyard at the moment. We've taken it to be looked at multiple times and nobody can seem to correctly diagnose what's going on with this car. It seems to have more trouble running in the colder months... Once it hits below freezing, it will shut down all winter and then start running again as it warms up outside. (But we have always done little fixes to the car here and there, so that might be why it started running again. I can't say for sure, but that is what it seems like.) 

The car will sometimes randomly shut down while driving, almost always in the middle of turning. (This car has given me driving PTSD.) When that happens, the battery stays on. The car stops accelerating, the brake gets stiff, and the power steering goes out. When it's idling, the headlights seem to dim in and out very subtly. It's hardly noticeable.  Before it broke down for good, when I pressed the gas, the oil pressure would drop to zero and when I pressed the brake, it would rise back up to normal levels. When accelerating, it would make the check oil light come on due to the drop in oil pressure, and when I would brake, it would go back off and Rise back to normal. I know that the check engine light has been on since I've got the car, even when it seemed to be running normally. I forget the reason why the previous owner told my dad it was on. (He got the car like 7 years ago now, and paid like $5,000 for a car that only seemed to run for about a year, steadily. My dad is a proud man that never wants to ask for help or make sure its a good deal before buying something by asking for help/guidance.) I just know he told him that it was something on the minor side and not to wory about it, I think. Maybe something to do with the oxygen sensor, I really don't remember and neither does my dad because it's been years now. ( I don't know why I was just like, ""okay, it's totally fine, even though the check engine light is on, it's not a big deal, no worries."" LOL freaking stupid. I'm pretty sure that the codes started with P0 or 0P LOL Not much help there, but it's been a couple years since I've used the car at this point. I do remember there were like 3 or 4 codes, all starting with the same numbers/letter, except one. 

Anyways, we had the radiator hoses flushed out, we had the radiator changed, we had the fuel pump changed, the water pump changed, the fuel filter changed, the spark plugs and spark plug wires changed, the battery changed, the alternator changed, a couple of fuses changed. I mean perhaps it actually is an engine or transmission problem, but I swear we had those checked a couple times too by mechanics and it was never the diagnosis we were given. However, since the check engine light is on, it's always a possibility. What I don't get is how a mechanic could run Diagnostics and still not figure out what the issue was. Especially when it was Midas who suggested the fuel pump, filter, water pump and radiator.

The car has less than 100,000 miles on it but it was close to hitting 100k. Within 5 to 10k miles, if I remember correctly. The majority of the time I had this car, it was never running properly. We eventually gave up on it and just leased the new one. I'm probably just going to sell it for some ridiculously cheap amount, especially because I don't know what's wrong with it but I thought I would try one more time to get an idea of what could be wrong with it so I have something to tell people. I know nobody can confidently diagnose it online, but a suggestion is better than absolutely nothing. I had somebody message me from Facebook after reading my listing and told me that they had a similar issue with their mom's Buick lesabre, and it was the crankshaft sensor. Does that sound like what could possibly be wrong with this car? Somebody else messaged me and suggested it could be a bad ground wire or something like that. I don't know that much about cars, so I'm just open to suggestions in general. I appreciate any help or guidance anyone can give. Thank you."

Super charger no boost
Having weird boost issues. About two weeks ago my 89 thunderbird sc alternator went out. Long story short parts store employees kept ordering the wrong one so I didn’t get the actual replacement for the whole two weeks. During those two weeks, I had everything unplugged and the intake manifold for the intercooler, so the supercharger internals were exposed up top(the car had the hood closed the whole time).Just installed the new alternator a couple hours ago and now I have no boost even under load at 5k rpms. When at idle it’s got about-20 vacuum. When being driven the boost gauge will not go above 0 no matter rpm, or amount of throttle through the peddle. Also the car lags super hard if you hit the gas it actually slows down. It will only drive “normal” under slight load and if you go easy on the peddle. It also chops now at idle, and struggles to stay about 500rpm. This is my first supercharged vehicle and I’m not super informed when it comes to sc’s. Really just looking for advice on what I should do first. Seems like it would be something simple, the car starts right up and will still take me anywhere I need to go… it just refuses to make boost now. Wondering if it’s possible something “went bad or broke” while it was sitting for those two weeks. "

2015 Honda Civic Si
Hey everyone, so I drive a 2015 Honda Civic Si (fb6). I am at 142xxx miles on it. I haven't had any issues with the car. However, today I went to run some errands and on my way home my car kept losing power. As opposed to idiling, the RPMs would drop till the engine was off. Now I was able to use the gas to keep it alive. I was only 2 minutes from home when this happened and made it home. When I got home I opened the hood and saw it was smoking. Not heavily but still. 
Now I do have a broken down pipe. The flex pipe broke in the down pipe, but that wouldn't be enough to cause this I don't think.

Bought second-hand Mazda Demio – stalling issue nobody can diagnose. Need help!
TL;DR:
Bought a second-hand Mazda Demio from 2016 from a dealer in Malta. Car broke down soon after purchase. My mechanic suspected fuel in the engine oil. The dealer replaced parts and attempted repairs multiple times with his own electrician and mechanic, but the car still stalls when shifting from Park to Drive/Reverse, with no fault codes showing up. Now it’s back with an electrician. I’m not very technical, so I’m looking for advice on what could be going wrong.

⸻

Full Story:
Hi everyone. Last month I bought a second-hand Mazda Demio from a licensed car dealer here in Malta. After the purchase, I took it to a trusted mechanic for a routine check-up and service, just to be on the safe side.

During this checkup, my mechanic noticed a strong fuel smell in the engine oil and warned me that something might be seriously wrong. He advised that I monitor the car over the next 100 km to see if any issues would develop.

Sure enough, after about 100 km, the car suddenly lost power and stalled while in traffic. The dashboard and radio remained on, indicating that it wasn’t a total electrical failure. I had the car towed back to my mechanic, who diagnosed a faulty high-pressure fuel pump (HPFP).

I informed the dealer, who provided a replacement HPFP for free. However, the replacement did not resolve the issue. My mechanic then observed that several electrical errors began appearing during further diagnostics. Following the dealer’s advice, I took the car to an auto electrician of his choice, but that electrician did not find any error codes.

With no clear answers, the dealer then had the car taken to his own mechanic. This mechanic also confirmed that no fault codes were present, but he noted that the car starts normally but immediately stalls when shifting from Park into Reverse or Drive.

Over the next week or so, this mechanic stated he:


	•	Replaced the high-pressure fuel pump (again)

	•	Replaced the torque converter

	•	Replaced the fuel injectors

	•	Even disassembled the entire gearbox


Despite all these efforts, the issue remains unresolved. Now, the car has been returned to the electrician, who suspects that it might be due to a twisted wire or something similar.

Additionally, although the dealer provided a temporary replacement car, it’s in poor condition and not practical to use. It’s now been over a month since I purchased the Mazda Demio, and I still don’t have a reliably working car.

⸻

Looking for advice from Mazda Demio owners or auto mechanics:
I don’t have a vast knowledge of cars, so I’d really appreciate your help in understanding what might be going on. Based on the symptoms and the parts that have been replaced:

	•	What could cause the car to start fine but immediately stall when shifting from Park into Drive or Reverse?

	•	Does it sound plausible that a twisted wire could be responsible, or might it be something else (like sensor issues, fuel delivery problems, or even an ECU malfunction)?

	•	Is it unusual that no fault codes are being recorded, despite the seriousness of the problem?

	•	Could the original fuel-in-oil issue have led to more significant engine or electrical damage over time?

	•	Overall, does this situation seem fixable, or should I consider pushing for a full replacement or refund from the dealer?


Any explanations in simple terms or personal experiences would really help me figure out my next steps. Thanks in advance for your insights!"

2017 Kia Forte Trunk lock actuator broken
Went to the store a few nights ago, shut the trunk, it wouldn't shut.  I see there was a recall on a trunk part for Kia and I think it's the exact part on my car.  I didn't buy it from the dealer, bought it on carvana but even if the dealer will fix it for free I'd rather do it myself if it's easy and cheap because I only have 1 car and don't have time to leave it at the shop.  

Why can't I find this part at the auto parts stores?  Is there a shortage on it?  I called 3 stores in my town, none of them have the part.  This part should be pretty easy to install myself right, just unscrew bolts, hook wire on then screw bolts back on? I heard a clunking noise by the actuator part when I lift the trunk up and down, like something broke off.  Also, my car horn isint beeping like normal when I lock it but it does lock, that started happening when the trunk part failed so I'm guessing it's related to the trunk not locking completely (trunk open icon on dash 24/7). 

Any help would be appreciated "

Car broke down, mechanic told me I’ll need a new engine and the cheapest I could get it for is 10k
Hey y’all, so about a week ago my 2016 Hyundai Veloster suddenly broke down 100 miles away from home. After a $600 tow back, the mechanic I chose told me my engine is “burnt up” but has not told me what the actual problem is. They say my engine must be completely replaced, and the cheapest used engine I could get starts at $8,000 with 90k miles (20k than what my car already has!) and that’s not including labor. 
I’m wondering if I could just buy an engine and pay someone else to swap it for me? Or is this a reasonable price? I think 8k for an engine with that mileage is absurd as I’m already paying $10k and I bought the car initially with 70k miles. I really do not want to pay that however I am in need of a car, and I just got this car 3 months ago. I do not plan on moving forward with this mechanic but I am wondering what options I have. "

WWYD 99 F250 SD won't charge battery
About 1 1/2 years ago, while my SIL was borrowing it, my truck was broken into --  steering column ripped out, door handles broken, stuff stolen. They broke off their screwdriver, tho, so couldn't get it started. Towed it home. 

Just before that, it threw a sparkplug. I don’t know if there might be a relationship to my problem now, but he kept driving it without telling me. 

Truck sat until a few weeks ago when a mechanic friend fixed the sparkplug and steering column. It appeared that the old battery wouldn't hold a charge,  so I had a new one installed. Now that battery also dies. 

The truck starts and runs better than ever when jumped,  or when I charge it overnight. But it's obviously not generating the battery when driven. 

My friend came back, and we tested every fuse, and everything else he could think of to test. All is well, including the alternator.  He suggested I take it to Les Schwab and have them retest the battery and alternator. They initially told me that both are good, but then said the alternator reads a little high.

As everyone I've talked to about this told me to, I have driven it for 20+ minutes several times -- 45 minutes after leaving Schwab's. At home,  I shut it off, then restarted. Left the charger off, tried it the next morning,  and again the battery was dead.

When running,  the gauge reads about halfway, and does not fluctuate. I don't actually know just what the gauge is reading  -- the battery level? The alternator output?

I need to know where to go from here. 

Does the high alternator reading suggest that I replace it?

Should I instead start by replacing the battery wires?

Other suggestions? 

I hate to ask to my friend to minutely check every wire and connection,  but I know I can't as I don’t know enough. 

I will be greatly appreciative of anything anyone can suggest. As I'm not motor savvy in the least, I'd also appreciate any information shared be dumbed down. "

Knocking sound from engine in park
It’s a old car I know i’m planning to drive it until it’s completely done with but I still want to maintain it good since in all those years it never broke down on me nor had any issues with the car until now. 

Car: Skoda superb 2013 2.0 103kw Diesel DSG
engine code: CFFB.

So when I start my car in the morning it makes this awfully loud knocking sound and the sound isn’t consistent this only happens when I first start the car after not driving it for Atleast 7+- hours.

Some info that may contribute to this issue: 1.when I start driving in the morning and press on the break pedal it’s as if the car doesn’t want to stop it keeps kind of ignoring the break until I press the pedal harder

2.Also when I try to put it in R or D from Park the DSG seems stuck I have to kind of pull on it, issue is usually when it’s cold but it also happens when warm kind of random times it seems like.

400k km/s on the car never changed any original parts of the car only the usual car services oil change etc.

Here a vid of the sound

Identify this sound please!
I've had some issues with my VW Passat 2.0 TDI 2017 over the last month. First, I got the water pump replaced and the cambelt too as it's all the same system so may as well. This was all after a terribly worn pump causing a leak in the coolant system.

I did one big drive and then the next time I used it, the car broke down and was refusing to rev beyond 1000 rpm, and would die if I tried. Eventually It couldn't idle. Two hours later it started and I got it into a parking space. Sent it back to the mechanic who said the Partifulate filter needed resetting or whatever, so they did that.

Now, I drove it after not touching it for two weeks as I was away and the engine light is on again and I hear this sound by the driver side (UK). This is around where the pulleys, belts, water pump is...

Please help me diagnose."

Oil Analysis/2015 Equinox
Posted about a week or so ago about my 2015 equinox with gas in the oil. Was told I had timing chain issues (with no diagnostics or checking the chain, etc.)

HPFP was replaced bc it showed minor signs of leakage. Valve cover and intake manifold also replaced.

My symptoms still persisted and also the car ran worse really since they did the initial repairs. One of those reasons was they didn’t put an air intake boot back on properly or tight enough so I had a vacuum leak. (2.5 months ago)

Since been confirmed I also have a small rear main seal leak, a crack in my exhaust manifold (from under side of the car I think). First repair shop barely gave my any documentation. They had it 4-5x. Only got 2 invoices. But car was on a lift there 3x.

They never mentioned the rear main seal. Also never mentioned the exhaust manifold. Did they overlook them? Did the exhaust get broke when they repaired other gaskets?

Oil analysis said 1.5% fuel in oil, which is in black stones normal range. Flashpoint also a little low. Other places have slightly different metrics.

ChatGPT said fuel % is higher end of normal and the difference in flashpoint means something is going on even if it isn’t EMERGENCY STATUS.

Is one test accurate? My oil is and has been thinned out also. But there’s no water in it?

My oil and filter REEK of gas. Midas techs agreed that it did.

Is it possible there is some gas in oil but other gas is fumes from exhaust manifold crack? Leak down test done. Was normal. Tried to do a back pressure test, but was unable to because my O2 sensor is seized… Although they said it’s working. They said they couldn’t remove it because if it broke, I would have to repair my catalytic converter at the cost of $1400.

Am I tripping?

Please any ideas and info is appreciated."

Check engine P0304 came on.  Cylinder 4 misfire.  Was going to change the spark plug and see if the fix was that simple.  When taking off the ignition coil the bolt broke right where it connects to the engine.  There is maybe millimeters of screw exposed out of where it connects.  I haven’t taken the spark plug out yet.  

I think I have a few options.  1. Use a screw/bolt extractor.  I’ve used screw extractor before, but never tried it on a broken bolt.  Im worried I might make it worse, also worried about metal debris getting down in there.  One friend told me not to do this and let a shop weld onto it to take out the screw properly  2. Take it to a mechanic. If I do this, Is it safe enough to put the old ignition coil on?  It’s about a 7 mile drive, no freeway.  I would reassemble everything I’ve taken off only difference is my cylinder 4 ignition coil isn’t really being held down.  "

Clutch keeps sticking - garage don't know why
My Hyundai's clutch keeps becoming stiff and then sticking to the point that I can't change gears anymore. It happens more in hot weather and/or when I have been driving the car for a long time. Then, after this happens, if I leave the car alone for a little while the clutch goes back to normal, which makes it difficult for a garage to see the problem.

I had the same issue with my fiat recently and after paying for a new clutch (at a different garage) it turned out it was the slave cylinder. So I told my garage this when I took the Hyundai but they were adamant it was the clutch, so I had that replaced but the clutch sticking happened again and I broke down on the motorway. My car got taken back to this garage by the breakdown service but by this time the clutch had cooled and was acting normally again. 

I reiterated that I think it's the master/slave cylinder but the garage keep saying it's not and they don't know what's wrong. 

What else could it be or is it likely it is the master/slave cylinder?

Really appreciate any advice! :)"

2013 F-150 Raptor Stalling at Low RPM: Advice Needed
Hello all, any advice is appreciated!

TL;DR: My 2013 F-150 Raptor stalls and sends a ""Low Oil Pressure"" error after being shifted to drive and letting the RPMs get too low. This all comes after replacing spark plugs, coils packs, and fuel injectors. Reverse, and idle in park are not affected.

I purchased a Gen-1 2013 Raptor in January with some goals in mind for some maintenance as it was purchased at 130k miles. Now that it's warm I decided to tackle spark plug replacement along with the coil packs and some new fuel injectors. I started the truck after replacing these parts and noticed fuel coming from a fuel injector, so I broke everything down again and realized the O-ring got pinched and misshapen during install. The O-ring was replaced and the fuel leak solved. 



However, after taking it around the block, stopping multiple times to check for leaks or odd idle sounds with no issue, I pulled into my slightly inclined driveway and as I rolled to a stop the engine stalled and sent an ""Oil Pressure Low"" alert on the gauge cluster with the oil pressure needle plummeting to zero. I retested on flat ground with the same result. I see no oil leaks, and the dipstick shows perfect oil levels. I am not even due for an oil change for another 2k miles. 

  
I've checked every connection to the fuel injectors, spark plugs, and coil packs and it doesn't seem that any are connected wrong to cause an improper firing order. The truck starts just fine, idles, and can be put in reverse, but once I shift to drive, the second I let the RPMs fall it stalls and sends the oil error.

  
Any advice on what to check before I decide I have to send it to a mechanic is greatly appreciated!"

2017 Kia Forte having issues
2017 Kia Forte with the 4 cylinder engine. Just over 100k miles. Wife went on a wedding trip with her friends and the car broke down 6 hours from home. She said everything was normal then it started shaking when she was in traffic and it cut off. I had her park it on the side of the road and went down there last night with a trailer and brought it home. I checked her oil about 2 weeks ago when she asked me to put washer fluid in it. It was above the add line so I left it alone since we are about 800ish miles from the next oil change. 

When I got to the car, the oil was barely on the bottom of the dipstick. I added some oil and got it loaded up and brought it home. I’m took it for a drive around the block and everything seems normal. It’s not ticking, it’s not shaking, nothing. Then I’m coming up to a red light and a red light flashes on the dash for 1/4 second. It’s either oil pressure or steering wheel. Couldn’t tell that’s how fast it came on and off. It idled a little rough for a second as well but then back to normal. No metal on the dipstick, oil level isn’t dropping. Car is still saying it’s getting 38+ MPG. Only thing I notice is when I pull the dipstick there’s smoke coming out of the hole, as well as when I take the oil fill cap off some smoke comes out. What do you think is going on? I plan on taking it to a shop on Tuesday when I’m off work. "

Prius-C inverter and transmission replacement
2012 Toyota Prius-C, 8th VIN Digit: 3

TLDR version: car showed pictured error code. Toyota dealership diagnosed as inverter issue. Got new inverter and car broke down twice shortly thereafter with same code. Dealership unable to diagnose for 6+ months, now says that I need new transmission, but also that the inverter was still a correct diagnosis and needed replacing. Could this be right? No transmission issues before new inverter went in.

Long version: My 2012 Toyota Prius-C initially showed the error code in the photo at the start of August. I had it towed to the Toyota service center because it was a Friday night and my regular mechanic was closed until Monday. Dealership diagnosed that I needed new inverter. Did that replacement to the tune of $3700, hoping the push the need to buy a new car for a couple years.

After I got the car back, I noticed that the transmission seemed off if I accelerated hard, kind of like lurch/skip sensation. Three weeks later, car shows same code on a hard acceleration. Dealership diagnoses a loose pin in the computer, which I question them on and tell them about the transmission issue. They insist it's fixed, no charge. Three days later, car breaks down again with the same code.

For 6.5 months, they can't diagnose it and tell me it's being run up the chain with Toyota. Finally, I'm told it needs a new transmission. They have had my car for almost 11 months now. (They did give me a loaner.)

My issue is that the dealership is seemingly telling me that inverter and transmission both went out at the exact same moment? They told me the inverter is the car's brain and needed to be replaced to tell us what was actually wrong (or something like that). I had no transmission issues prior to the first error code and subsequent new inverter. 

Is the explanation I got plausible and/or am I misunderstanding the diagnosis? This whole saga has been baffling; any insight appreciated."

A/C flickering, could this have happened during a recent repair?
I know literally nothing about cars. I have a 2015 Acura MDX with 70k miles that has never had issues until last week when the check engine light came on with an “emissions system problem” warning. It’s up to date on maintenance and well cared for. 

I took it in to get fixed at the mechanic I use for everything, they said a seal on the air intake was cracked and replaced it, which was apparently labor intensive. The a/c was doing this when I picked it up, they now insist it was doing this when I brought it in. It’s pretty apparent and I’m in South Texas so the a/c is always going full blast so I just feel like I would have noticed it and I definitely would have been concerned enough to bring it in if I had noticed it. Is it possible they mixed up something electrical when doing the work or diagnostics and are trying to save face/charge me to fix the issue they caused? 

Also, the emissions system warning came on again today and my car basically broke down while I was driving home, so it’s back with them anyway because they clearly missed something initially. "

Does my gear oil look okay?
Citroen Relay 244 2.8 HDI diesel manual 2005. 

I had a total gearbox rebuild a few weeks ago (bolt broke off the diff and wrecked the insides), and have been driving softly on it since. But the last few days I've sometimes been getting some crunching/grinding when shifting down from 3rd to 2nd if I don't press the clutch the last few mm of travel. This didn't happen on the previous gearbox (even when it was damaged) or immediately after installing the new one. I checked the clutch mechanism and all seems fine, but I noticed some oil on the bottom of the gearbox and starter motor (which has also been making funny noises occasionally), mostly around the seam where it bolts into the engine - it's hard to see in the pics. That's the same place there was oil before the box was rebuilt (though there isn't as much oil this time), so I thought I'd better check the oil. I drained it and measured the full 2.7 litres that I'd put in, so I can't have lost much (if any). However, I'm not sure it's supposed to be that dark and glittery after such a short time, and there are some small shavings on the plug magnet. It doesn't feel grainy and there are no big pieces of metal so I guess it's okay, but I'm slightly concerned about the possible leak (can't see what else it could be but gear oil) and grinding changing gears. What do you reckon?"

2000 Mercedes C280 Sport W202 v6 Trouble Shifting?
So, for a few months now I've been unemployed and unable to fix my car. Off and on I kept getting a loss of power, as well as flashing dash for check engine. Code kept saying misfire in cylinders. Cylinders changed each time.  By loss of power I mean it would refuse to shift into higher gear
It would Rev to beyond 3000 rpms, not shift, and then when slowed down would shake uncontrollably. If I turned it off and started it back up, it would ""fix"" itself more than likely. 

I started to get worried when the vehicle after being in reverse, would treat drive as neutral. If I went into park after that it would lock into park and I would not be able to switch to any other gear until I turned it off and back on. 

The vehicle dash is broken. Sometimes it lights up, other times it doesnt. Odometer is unknown but it said it had 120000 on it or so last I checked. I'm unsure. Sparkplug and coil packs were never changed. So since I finally got the money and time, I had my father in law help me with all twelve sparkplugs. At first, it seemed like the issue was fixed, but after driving it extensively today, I noticed it would sometimes still have that issue of not changing gears and would Rev way past 4000 rpms and I'd have to pull over, turn it off and back on. The rumbling of the car has not happened, so it no longer feels like a misfiring issue.

I wanted to check the transmission fluid, but I don't know if I can. Where the dips tick would be is a cap saying dealership use only. I don't have a way to pop the cap off to my knowledge, but it's a little 2000...surely there's gotta be a key or something somewhere. 

I'm a broke guy, I wanna fix my car. I don't know what to do. My check engine light is still on but no longer flashes, and it still gives me the codes probably because I haven't removed it. Is an ob2 reader able to? 

Anyway that's my story. Do you guys have any clue what could be happening? "

Truck won't go into gear
I have a 95 Ford F-150 the truck won't go into gear and sometimes when I'm driving and I come to a complete stop it'll just lose the gear  does anyone have any idea whether this is the transmission or the torque converter?
Once it finally goes in gear and I'm driving it down the road it shifts through every other gear just fine it's just an issue getting it to go in gear. I'm just curious what everybody's thoughts is I was hoping it's just the torque converter I have another truck that's broke down right now and the cheaper the fix the better.

1998 K1500 4x4. Need some help diagnosing the problem.
So my uncle and I trying to get his 98 K1500 back on the road. A few things first:

I know the exhaust is leaking among other small things and I know I shouldn’t be under the truck with it in gear.

So, years ago the shift lever broke off, replaced it with one from a junkyard. After that, it wouldn’t go into park but could start in neutral and drive just fine, just no park. This has been a known issue.

The tranny is still relatively new, 75k to 100k miles something like that. The transmission fluid looks good on both color and level. 

The new issue:

It’s been sitting a while now, a year or two hasn’t been started. We pulled it out the other day and now there is no reverse. Just get that high pitched whine you could hear in the video. We tried adjusting cable, I’m not sure we did right to begin, but that didn’t help. After “adjusting” the shift lever will not go back up. Shifted to park using the arm under the truck. It shifts down without problem. Drive also works btw. The truck moves in drive no problem. I think I could also hear a bit of that whining noise while the truck was in drive and moving. 

I may have missed something feel free to ask away. Would greatly appreciate some insight on this. Thanks in advance. 

Also, apologies on that annoying ass door alarm.

Front End Bouncing After Major Suspension Work — Shocks or Alignment? (2004 Dodge Dakota)
My brother’s 2004 Dodge Dakota had some serious issues—clunking noise, pulling to the side, and what turned out to be dangerously worn suspension components. I recommended my buddy, who’s affordable and knows his stuff. Here's what was done:

Replaced all 4 brake pads

New brake lines

Replaced tie rod ends

Replaced both upper and lower control arms (entire assemblies) on both sides

Put a rear leaf spring back into its clamp/holder (it had pulled out)

Did a basic alignment (not with a machine—he told my brother to get a shop alignment afterward)


All that was done for $850, parts included.

Problem now:

After the repairs, the front end is bouncing a lot while driving—like 2–3 bounces when pressing down and letting go, compared to the rear which settles quickly. Both front shocks are original (220k miles) and missing rubber bushings. My brother says it’s from bad alignment or the leaf spring. I say it’s likely the worn-out shocks finally showing their age.

He thinks my buddy somehow “broke” the shocks, but they were original and this bounce seems like a classic sign of bad shocks to me.

What do you think?

Could poor alignment or leaf spring stuff cause front-end bounce like that—or is this just worn shocks needing replacement? Trying to settle this and end the argument.

Wheel spacer and stud length
Hey. I recently got an 09 silverado. 
As I was driving down the highway, the wheel studs broke. Upon further inspection I noticed that the studs holding the wheel spacers on were protruding past the edge of the spacers. And on the backside of the rim I noticed markings where the studs where pressed against it. My question is if that is what caused the studs to fail. And if so, during replacement can I cut down the length of the studs to prevent it in the future? Thanks in advance!"

A pencil in my gas tank

I have 2019 Jeep. The gas doesn’t have a gas cap, instead it has one of those insides that clamps down, don’t know how else to describe this.

I ran out of gas and my boyfriend came with a gas can. We tried to fill it, but the spout didn’t go down far enough to get past the gate-like things. So he decided to use a pencil to try to prop it open, but instead the pencil got stuck, we pulled it out, and part of it broke off inside. Maybe about an inch.

Please, can anyone help me understand what can cause this issue?
The motor for my drivers side window broke and I had to get it replaced bc the window wouldn’t roll up or down. After getting my car back I noticed that the automatic lock button, the one for locking all the passengers doors at once, no long works. It doesn’t lock or unlock the doors anymore. Its seems obvious that the dealership caused the issue considering this happened at the exact same time they were working on the car and is in the exact same location that they were working on.

I have to take it back and they’ve avoided acknowledging responsibility so im nervous theyre going to try and screw me over and say it wasnt them. Do any of you know how working on the window motor could have affected the lock button? I know nothing about cars so if i have a better idea of how this would happen I think they’d have less opportunity to bullshit me on what did happen here. Thanks!

03 350z clutch issues vq35de
(Posting for a friend as we have found no solution yet this is his post below)
[I recently installed a new clutch about 800 miles ago and all has been good until one day. I felt the clutch engagement point lower than usual. I went on throughout the week, not thinking about it and it got worse to the point where if I push the clutch pedal in the car is still engaged. I have replaced the master cylinder and the slave cylinder from autozone and a new stainless steel line from Z1. I bench bled the master and installed everything and my clutch engagement point was better but after a day or so it will just get lower again like if I'm loosing pressure, I have to get under the car and bleed it like every other day to even drive the car. I have no leaks but I'm wondering how can I tell if my master cylinder is faulty. Even after buying a replacement from autozone I feel like the master isn't functioning properly I'm not sure if it's leaking internally or it's pulling air in maybe any input would be much appreciated as my car is currently broke down unable to get into gear. Before I was able to bleed it and at least get to where I need to go and clutch never felt spongy but now even bleeding the clutch down by the slave cylinder does nothing and my clutch is super spongy with no pressure.]

Now this is what i have noticed the first time we bled it with the autozone parts it did build pressure with the autozone parts but lost it a couple days after he also bought a lower clutch line he bought a master and slave From nissan he went back to oem to rule out a faulty part from autozone we were working on it today he bench blead the master before putting it in the car we hooked all the clutch line the upper and lower was using a bleeder bottle as i pumped the pedal and it was not building pressure at all any advice or resources  would be appriciated"

2011 RAV4 broke down within a month of owning
Hey, I recently purchased a 2011 3.5L V6 RAV4. Within 30 days the car is broken down and is now sitting in a lot. I was driving it and suddenly the car sort of cut off on the highway. Check engine, VSC and 4WD came on. The car would start and stop almost instantly right after. I checked the code. Originally I had a P0102 (MAF), P0113 (IAT sensor) and P0351-P0356 come on (Ignition coils 1-6). This was the second time the car cut off on me after a recent refuel at a station the day before, but I was able to restart the car and go after that first one.  
  
I would like to know if anyone has any suggestions on what to do first. I have seen a lot of people throw a lot of money at replacing relays, sensors, coils, ECU, etc. to no avail. I have cleared the codes but the ignition coils are permanent codes and I don't think they'll go away until several drive cycles. I got a new gas cap because that looked bad anyway.  
  
I warmed the car up yesterday for about 10 minutes, drove around a lot for about another 10, everything ran fine, no rough idle, I had enough space to safely give it some gas and get through some gears. Ran fine, no hesitation, no blips. Then I decided to sit in a parking spot for a minute and give the car a break. It was within maybe 2 minutes of sitting there doing nothing that the car cut off on me while parked and then struggled to turn over again. Same dash lights as before came on. The ignition coil codes all came back but none of the other codes.  
  
I have a hard time believing that all 6 of those coils went bad at the same time, so I would maybe like to know if anyone has any idea as to what could indirectly lead to 6 faulty ignition coil codes. Help! This car is my only way to work and I can't afford to not have it.

Why won’t my car rev past 5k rpm?
Looking for advice as I’ve been loosing my mind trying to figure this out myself over the past year. Car is a 2003 Nissan Sentra 1.8l auto.
It runs great 90% of the time. But under heavy load or full throttle it won’t rev past 4.5-5k rpm. Meaning if you’re cruising down the highway at 75 and come to a hill. The car downshifts to maintain 75. But since it can’t rev past 4.5-5k rpm it fails to maintain and I end up going like 50mph uphill. Driving around town or on flat highway you’d never know there was a problem. But try to drive up an incline, or go full throttle up the onramp to merge and it just falls on its face between 4.5 and 5k rpm. It’ll sit there all day long until I left off the gas then it’ll upshift, which is too high of a gear so it’ll downshift, then get stuck at 4.5-5k and never accelerate. 

It really sounds like it’s hitting a rev limiter or fuel cut. If you look up videos of 0-60 pulls in an automatic 1.8 it shows under full throttle it should shift around 6.5rpm. So the problem is finding out why I’m hitting some sort of rev limiter or fuel cut. Only check engine is p0420 for gutted cats.

Things I’ve tried 
New spark plugs and coil packs
Inspect if cats are plugged (they’d already been gutted)
MAF sensor 
Cam and crank position sensors 
Fuel pump

I’ve gotten it to rev normally to 6.5k rpm two times. I unbolted everything behind the first gutted cat to see if the second cat or muffler was plugged, So it was just the exhaust manifold and gutted cat connected. It was still kinda stumbly, but actually broke through and revved to 6.5k. I bought a replacement cat back exhaust system thinking clearly something is plugged. Put the exhaust on, now it won’t rev past 4.5-5 again 🙃. 

Things I suspect
P0420 code (from the gutted cats) downstream o2 is messing up the fuel maps? Everything I find says running catless has no effect on fuel map on these 1.8s

Fuel injectors plugged and running out of fuel at high rpm under heavy load?


Any help or advice is appreciated. "

Renault Clio radiator and AC broke down, are these two related?
I’ve been driving a Renault Clio 3 (2009) for the past year, no issues with it so far. The AC has also worked well.

Last Wednesday, while driving on the highway the car starts beeping and showing the warning message: overheated engine. Aside from the warning message there were no other issues, no weird sounds or other changes. The car continued working. 

I immediately pull over, call the towing service and bring it to the repair shop. 

There the mechanic says that both the engine radiator and AC radiator are broken and need to be replaced. Ok, I agree to replace them. Bye, bye 400€ 🤑

After that I take the car to another car shop, to get the AC recharged (because all the liquid had leaked, due to the faulty radiator). This second car shop tells me that they tried recharging the AC, but noticed that it is broken, somewhere there is a leak, possibly the compressor is broken. Because they do not handle AC repairs,  they recommend me to go to a specialised AC service, to get it checked out. 

I’m still in the process of finding a service nearby, that does these kinds of repairs… 

In the meantime, as I have no mechanical knowledge whatsoever, I could really use some help to understand better what is happening. 


Before Wednesday both the car and the AC were working fine. Then the radiator stopped working, which caused the engine to overheat. I got that fixed, but now suddenly the AC is also broken. Could these two defects be related? Could there be another underlying issue causing both the radiator and the AC to break? Is it safe for me to continue driving this car, until I get the AC checked out?  Are there any indicators / clues that I could check by myself, to understand better what is happening with the car or if it has any other underlying issues?

Thank you very much in advance. 🙏"

Mazda 3 2010 making strange noise after I sit down or push the trunk down
This is a Mazda 3 2010 sedan 2.0
The title is self explanatory. Does anyone have any idea what it could be? The sound comes from the rear, and I think left side but I’m not sure because it mainly happens after I sit on the drivers side seat so I can get a good listen (the phone was under the rear left side)
Also I had the rear left shock mount break down, after I went on a bump on the highway (I think the shock absorber was actually broken way before, but the shock mount broke during the bump, after which the car started making the sound in the video). 

P.S. I replaced both shocks and mounts in the rear and it still makes the noise.

Any advice is appreciated! "

Engine replacement or rebuild?
I’ve got a 2010 Toyota Camry with a 4 cylinder (2AR-FE) engine.  We just bought it for $6500.00 3 months ago, the car seemed to be running fine and was in great shape. Unfortunately it recently broke down for my fiance on the way to work. It completely stalled out on her and threw code P0017. It still drives(we haven’t been, just to a shop and then we had it towed home). It rattles on cold start and even during driving at certain engine speeds, and seems to send a lot of torque at idle to the wheels; you gotta hold the brakes otherwise it’ll launch you forward or backward.   I know all of this suggests the VVT gear went on it, so I’ve been considering a VVT gear and timing chain replacement. 
I’m concerned about a few things though; one being that the valves have been damaged.
The other being that the piston rings need replacement on the engine as it burns oil.
I had one friend suggest just rebuild the whole engine, 
I’m also considering just replacing it. 
I did 3 years of high school auto shop and am decently mechanically inclined, but not super… I i’m relatively confident I could do a time and chain and VVT gear, and I know I could do an engine swap as well. Obviously the more money I save the better, but if it makes sense to go spend $5000 on a rebuilt engine I would consider that. What would you do?"

1978 Hiace - Suspected Fuel Pump failure. Is this it???
Hi everyone, 

Is this the fuel pump in the pictures???
(2nd pic is taken from under the van)

Van broke down and roadside assist basically told me that the fuel pump has died. I'm pretty sure it's a mechanical fuel pump. How hard would it be to change this myself as someone that's never worked on cars too much? 

[I've done brake pads on a Holden Commodore and an Alternator in a '06 Subaru Liberty (Legacy in USA), both with a step by step youtube guide with no trouble at all. 
Unfortunately, I cannot find any videos about the Toyota 12R engine fuel pump.]

The van is currently just sitting in my driveway, the most I'd be able to raise it up is by pushing it onto some caravan leveling ramps. Is it worth me trying to do it myself or would the labor costs not be that expensive VS mucking around myself with it. Anyone know roughly how much $aud ?"

98 GMC Sierra k1500 5.7l
Hey all the other day I got in my truck after driving it to college (current first year automotive apprentice) and after starting it I noticed right away it was running rough. I found I was running lean on both banks (P0171 and P0174) and I have a misfire on cylinder 6 (P0306) I checked my fuel trim and I am infact running lean I'm unable to see the exact pressures through my specific gauge (it specifies Fuel trim 1 CL Fuel trim 2 CL ""Closed Loop"" for those wondering it's using the readings from my 02 sensors to gauge fuel pressure.) When this first started it'd come and go and now it's constant. 

I've replaced my MAF Sensor because I inspected it and found it was broke, I monitored my STFT and LTFT trims on both bank 1 and 2 on my way home and found my LTFT on both banks 1 and 2 were pretty much glued to 25% the whole time if I was harder on the gas it'd clear right up and all four trims would even out to about 12% which seems roughly right at times under the same rougher conditions they'd drop lower to about 5.5%. I did notice my LTFT on bank 2 would sometimes reach 35% under rough driving condtions aswell. My TPS is working and my CTS is reading accurately. I'm honestly at a loss, after school today I went ahead and checked my intake again for vacuum leaks when cold and not a single change. Engine performance is good but when those fuel trims equal out it's real good. My timing also sits at 22.5° and fluctuates between 21 and 23 well under load. 

I'll be checking my compression on cylinder 6 very soon here aswell as doing a leak down test to see if my valve is sticking but other then that am I missing something else??? 

I forgot to mention I also intend on pulling my distributor and checking for dead spots/failures aswell "

Am I getting scammed? $500 for a clutch kit?
My local repair shop is telling me that a clutch kit is gonna cost $500... 

Last week I finally got my 1987 Acura legend running well enough to take it down to the shop and see what it'll take to get it inspected, keep in mind I'm young and this is my first car and I know nothing. Ofc with my luck the clutch fork mount broke 100 yards from the shop, I managed to get it there by starting it in first gear(it's a manual) the shop quoted me $900 to replace the fork, thats parts and labour. 

That all seemed normal, but they recommended I replace the clutch as well, then quoted me $500 for just the parts as it wouldnt take much more time to install. I know I can get a clutch kit on RockAuto or Partsgeek for $80 to $160.

SO AM I GETTING SCAMMED or am I just stupid"

Cross-Threaded Seized and Broken off Bolt...... Any Tips
Vehicle:1983 Dodge w150

When installing my intake manifold and tightening down the bolts the bolt at the back of the engine broke off. 

I have finally remove the intake (again) and the bolt is very seized. 

I have tried using vicegrips to twist the bolt out, but it keeps just loosing teeth/removing the threads on the bolt. 

I've tried applying heat. Granted it was from a mini propane torch, and I'll see if I can get a large torch tomorrow when I try again. And I've also tried using WD40 to get it to budge. 

Nothing has even gotten it to move so far.

Is there anything else I can try. I know about bolt extractor kits, or drilling it out and tapping it. But I'd rather not do that yet. 

So..... any thoughts?"

Oil pressure light on-what should I do?
I have a 2016  Sonata with a theta engine that carries both a CarMax (Assurant) warranty and is covered by Hyundai if it experiences rod knock before 150k. Trust me I would sell the POS if I could but it’s so worthless now that I can’t afford to trade it in. I know the engine is on its way out but it’s just not *quite* bad enough for either Hyundai or Carmax to say “have a new engine!”
I have gone to SO many mechanics in the last month and it am going crazy. I had a weird loss of power happen multiple times on 4/28 and since I was about to go on a road trip that Friday I took it to a mechanic that day. Without any lights or codes they told me they couldn’t replicate the problem and to come back if it got worse. Charged me $90 for their time. We drove from Florida to Virginia without an issue, then on the way back we broke down in Georgia on 5/6. That mechanic performed testing and inspection, code is P1326. Scanned live data and said engine rod knock is present, engine is failing internally. They recommended we go to Hyundai for an engine replacement because of the knock sensor code. Hyundai took a look on 5/8 and said they wouldn’t be replacing the engine because knock wasn’t present. They said the oil level was low (has a history of oil consumption 3 quarts/thousand miles) and that doing an oil change would be the solution to our problems. I went to Take 5 on 5/19 for an oil top off, because the oil was looking low. They said I needed closer to 2 quarts than 1 quart, which I was suspicious about, but the car seemed to drive fine after. Then on 5/29 I drove to the gym and when I was at a stoplight the oil pressure light flashed on for a second, once I got all the way to their parking lot the oil pressure light stayed on I freaked tf our because I know you shouldn’t drive with that light on, so I had it towed to a mechanic. They charged me $50 for a quick inspection but basically said they wouldn’t touch it with a ten foot pole because it needs a combustion chamber cleaning, which only Hyundai has the technology to do. PS once I go to the mechanic on 5/29 the oil light was gone 🙄. Mechanic said my oil was clean and the level was good. 

Drove the car on 5/30 and it was fine. Then drove to work on 5/31 and as I parked the light lit up again. Turned the car on to go home and the light was off, drove home, and light turned on as I pulled in the driveway. I just checked and the oil is clean and at the right level. So idk what to do. None of these mechanics can diagnose a a problem to fix, but I also don’t want to drive with an oil pressure light on and somehow be held responsible for engine damage that already existed

Unless mechanics can replicate the condition, they can’t diagnose it, and it’s not happening enough that I can reliably replicate it. So what am I to do? Keep driving until the oil light stays lit up, risking damage? Continue to pay $50-100 to mechanic after mechanic after mechanic until we figure out a solution? Will the computer store these instances of low oil pressure lights and will that be used against me? "

84 Ford Fuel Pumps Intermittent
I’m working on my 1984 Ford E-350 ambulance. 460 gas/auto. Has fuel tanks with electric pumps in the tanks. 

The fuel pumps currently are not running and I’m broke down in middle of the road. I’ve got power at the oil pressure cutoff. Inertia switch is in. This has happened before and for an unknown reason power to both pumps stops and pumps don’t run. 

I recently replaced the fuel selector valve as it was overfilling the front tank. I just replaced the ignition control module. I just changed the spark plugs and rebuilt the carb yesterday, only to find the fuel pumps are not working. 

I’m thinking it’s either the fuel pump relay or a bad fuel selector. Help would be greatly appreciated!

Update: I switched the fuel tank switch back and forth several times and was able to get the rear tank pump to run. But the front tank is not running. I can go back and forth with the switch, rear tank runs but no front tank.

Am I crazy or did he actually do $215 worth of work?
For context, the car (a 2014 Ford Escape) initially broke down and couldn't go up hills. 

Took it to a transmission shop, and after they fixed it the first time, it jerked when accelerating and the check engine light was on. 

After they fixed it the 2nd time it didn't jerk anymore but the battery kept dying and the check engine light was on. 

The transmission shop said something was frying my transmission and we should get it fixed.

A neighbor offered to take a look and this is what he charged us. I don't really feel like he did much to actually FIX whatever caused the check engine light or whatever was frying our transmission...?

Should we just pay and say thanks for turning off the check engine light or will it just come back on eventually? 

We need everything to be okay for a smog test.

Thanks for y'all's help!

2016 Kia Sorento Engine Failure
Hello, My father’s vehicle recently broke down on him. I honestly don’t know much about cars and would like some help identifying this piece that came off the engine, maybe someone has had this happen to them. The car is a 2016 Kia Sorento LX 2.4. It has less than 75,000 miles. My dad is retiring now and was taking my nieces to school when all of a sudden the engine shut off. He was able to get to the side of the road safely. He tried to restart the car to no luck and when he looked under that car these 2 pieces were underneath. The engine no longer turns on. The engine light never came on.

I’m hoping someone can help identify these pieces that fell of the engine or possibly someone with a similar issue that can give some advice on a solution.

2005 Honda civic lx coupe airbag light on after removing passenger seat
I unbolted the seat and rail from the floor and disconnected the wiring from under the seat carefully so I could wash out a suspicious blood stain from the seat that wasn’t being sufficiently cleaned with a carpet cleaner. I also carpet cleaned the floor under the seat due to the same stain. 

Took the seat out, hosed it down, sucked the water out, then left it out to dry for atleast 4-5 hours. Put it back in, reconnected and bolted everything, airbag light is now on. How can I get the light to turn off? Is it an easy fix? Please help. 


Edit: I need the light off before June 4th because I have my last inspection needed to obtain a rebuilt title after it being salvaged for an attempted theft, and it’s with CHP. I live in a city filled with car thefts, (specifically older Hondas) killings, and general crime, but for some reason my city thinks the solution to those issues is fucking “parking patrol”. Essentially they just have a dedicated uh team or whatever they call themselves, that drive around and give people parking tickets. They’ve harassed me twice even though I have all of my paperwork and even a TOP. Luckily I’ve gotten off with mostly warnings so far, but they told me that if I don’t have it registered by a date in June, my car will be impoundable and I’ll have to pay some fee again to register my car. It’s my only form of transportation and I’m a broke dual major college student. I can’t even afford gas. They legit gave me a parking ticket and said i was too far off the curb when legitimately I was facing the correct way, and I was only 2 inches from the curb. Like the actual wall part of the curb. I tried submitting proof I did not commit a parking violation but it was refused. "

Finally bought a car, but it wont go in reverse when hot...
TLDR: The car drives and shifts fine on all gears, but on long drives 1hr+ when the car's running hot, it wont engage in reverse. Feels like it's in neutral. I have to wait it out for up to 5 mins or give it some gas for the car to suddenly engage reverse. Reverses perfectly fine when cold tho.  
  
I'm a broke ass college student who finally managed to save up enough for a beater 2004 3.0 V6 Camry for just 2k USD from someone leaving the country. It had 190k ODO and new fuel injectors as listed and when I viewed it with some friends it ran totally fine and quiet, even had working AC on it, I looked under it and it only had surface rust, no note worthy damage so I was pleasantly fine with just buying it. It has quite a few dents, lots of scratches and almost no clear coat paint left on the roof and hood but I didnt mind appearances, only that it drives well. So I bought it on the spot and never looked back. Drove it home and parked to the garage with the car facing front first for the first few times I drove it.  
  
I looked up everything to know about maintaining a car and I immediately replaced all liquids the week after I bought it , coolant, trans fluid, brake fluid, engine oil, power steering and even the brake pads.  Then I took it for a long drive and there and then I found out I could not reverse when the transmission is hot. Took it home and researched on what I could do and I made sure the transmission fluid was enough even when it runs hot (it was only a little bit above the line) and I even tried replacing the fluid again but the same issue is there. I looked at the papers I was given with the car and I then realized I made a huge mistake by not asking for a maintenance/service log. So I basically had no idea what the car has been through and of course the seller never replied to me again. I looked at the shift linkage/cable and it was fine. I even bought a OBD2 scanner but it gave me no codes. Figured I was gonna need to bring my transmission down but I don't have any tools for that so my only option is to go to a shop but I didn't have the cash anymore, and it was only reverse so I figured I just had to never put myself in a situation where I need to reverse when my trans is hot. 

The ODO is now 210k and I have saved enough to probably buy a transmission rebuild kit, filter and  solenoid to hopefully fix my reverse problem. I got into the car hobby in the meantime and replaced the axle/cv joints and greased it up and have done general maintenance for the car. I probably could do the transmission on my own if I also buy the right tools but it would take me weeks to finish with just Youtube guides.  
  
 I am now deciding whether I should ask a shop to do it for me and I buy the kit , make them buy the kit (don't really know the good brands yet as OEM is expensive af) and also do the repair, or risk it and do it on my own. I have a suspicion its a broken clutch band or broken seal but I am no real mechanic to know for real. Any advice is appreciated!"

Lexus AFS headlight issue after accident – right headlight stuck aimed down, no vertical movement
Hey everyone,

I got into a minor accident recently with my Lexus (nothing too major — no cracked lenses or blown lights), but now I’m having an issue with the right headlight. The car has Adaptive Front-lighting System (AFS), and usually, on startup, both headlights do the typical “dance” — they move up and down, then side to side — for self-leveling and calibration.

After the accident, only the right headlight doesn’t move up and down anymore. It still does the left-to-right sweep (steering input works), but it stays aimed downward, like how it sits when the car is off — and it never levels itself up. The left headlight works perfectly fine and goes through the full range of motion.

Important detail: the right headlight’s mounting points broke because the fender took the hit and got pushed into the headlight. The housing itself isn’t cracked or visibly damaged, and it’s still functional otherwise — it just doesn’t move vertically at all.

Could this be:
	•	A broken or misaligned leveling motor due to the loose mounting?
	•	A damaged or uncalibrated height sensor?
	•	Wiring or connector issues caused by the impact?
	•	Just a mechanical obstruction from being out of alignment?

I haven’t pulled any error codes yet but plan to soon. Before I take it in, I wanted to see if anyone’s experienced something similar or has any ideas. Thanks in advance!

I replaced everything but the coolant pipe and radiator; coolant flange, distributor tee, thermostat….

Could it still be leaking from the thermostat housing? it’s hard to tell since so much coolant is pooled up on the transmission and other local parts.

Interlock solenoid question!
Asking here because I'm kind of at a stand still. If there is a better place to ask this question, lmk in the comments and I'll ask there instead. I've done work on cars, just nothing super advanced.

Currently have a 07 Saturn Vue, VIN: 5GZCZ63487S825267, which I can't find hardly any information on at all, which has lead me to ask elsewhere. Ran fine. Parked. Started it up fine nearly 1 yr later, but it would not shift out of park. Few months later to now, same issue. Cranks, runs fine, can't get it out of park. Don't have a fancy release button on top gear shift to release. Transmission fluid level is fine. Oil level is fine. Fuses seem to be fine. Button on shifter goes in, but shifter won't move. Tried simple tricks with rocking the car, etc. Nothing.

My guess came down to the interlock solenoid, or something similar, if my model doesn't have one of those specifically. 

I posted a photo of what I'm dealing with. The white plastic piece was broken, so I tried taping it to see if maybe it was something simple as that, nope (also if you have the name of that piece I'd like to know so I can replace that too). 

Is the part, that my finger is at, the interlock solenoid? If not, name of it? Could this be the root of the issue? That part does not move. Tried with brake, no brake, shifter pressed, not pressed, doesn't move at all. Assuming that part is locked up. If not the root of the problem, advice?

Sorry for questions! Hopefully someone can help me out! It's an old car with issues, just usually runs fine until now. Still relatively new to DIY cars, had to learn to do the work myself due to almost always being broke."

Bought Honda ridgeline broke sparkplug. Paid someone to get it taken out. The guy kept my deposit and said he’s not going to take the plug out because the heads have to come off anyway because the valves are bent. Check engine light flashing engine stumbling. He didn’t do leak down or horoscope he just told me that he knows the valves are bent by listening to the engine and because all cylinders are misfiring at diff times. He showed me the obd. The car misfired but only on the cylinder with the broken plug. He then revved the engine and the car started to misfire on most cylinders but at different times. I’m going to be doing the work myself. Should I try to remove the plug put a new one in and see if it’s good? Or should I just not waste the time and remove the heads and get them resurfaced and fixed if they may be broken? Thanks"

I switched the probes back and finished the install, but now as soon as you turn the truck on the HVAC blower starts to blow.

I tried the blower resistor (still blows) and couldn't find any blown fuses.  There is a weird captive fuse on the left of the fuse bank, but I couldn't figure out how to even get it out.  I also unplugged the power locks (no change).  Any idea what I broke?  The Nissan is the stripped down model with manual everything."

P0420 please help!
Hello, Vauxhall Corsa 13plate 1.2 cc UK

I have had problems in the car since I bought it (my fault, brought from a dodgy fb marketplace girl who’s dad was a “mechanic”) by the time I got home, engine light was on reading p0171. This was august last year.

Car broke down the next day, RAC said it was the fuel pump, he grabbed a mallet and banged on it and car started again, but by the evening it died again. Got a mobile mechanic out and he changed the PCV valve and the light switched off, next day had a crankshaft problem, changed the sensor, light gone. Then immediately after light back on now reading p0420.

I can’t lie, I’m struggling for money and couldn’t afford a new Cat (mechanic recommended) so I left it, but MOT due in 3 weeks. Finally got enough for a cat and two sensors. First mechanic could not change the cat, it was too difficult, but changed the oxygen sensor that is just under the bonnet, engine light turned off for a day before turning back on. Second mechanic changed the bottom sensor but could not take the cat off. This was yesterday and now the light has come back on. Same code. I am done at this point, i know the car is a piece of crap but I simply cannot afford a new car at the minute. Just asking for recommendations on what you may think the actual problem is? It’s been seen by 4/5 mechanics in total all thinking it was just sensors as they said the cat looks fine, but if i really want it changed i may need to go to the dealership as it’s really difficult to get off. Any help? Is it related to the original p0171 issue? 

Thank you in advance 

Update ***

Cars gone to the scrap yard! Dealership asked for £1770 for a new cat (let alone the rest of the repairs they found). No back street garages were able to remove the cat (took it to 7🤣)! Thank you to all who responded and pm’d me! "

PCV Valve Change
How much does it usually cost to replace a PCV valve? I feel like I’m getting overcharged by Firestone. For the record I drive a 2013 Honda Civic

To add more context: I had my car towed to their parking lot on a Friday night after my car broke down. They had my car towed to an impound lot because they didn’t realize I was a customer. They promised to reimburse me for the cost of retrieving my care from the impound lot (I paid about $400 for it). The receipt shows that they discounted about $200 from my total tab. I have a feeling they are trying to give me a discount while still making a profit"

Last night I got home after dinner with my GF and saw my brake lights were on.  I thought that was weird and they weren’t turning off.  I thought something was wrong and then saw little pieces of hard plastic on the floor mat. The car wouldn’t start, but did have dash lights on and my gf wasn’t able to jump the car because I didn’t back in and cars were on either side of me. So we left it until this morning. 

Walk down this morning and the brake lights are off now. But car won’t even light up this morning. 

I got a jump and it immediately died 


So basically I’m guessing I now have a dead alternator from the battery draining completely?

And the hard plastic parts I googled and it seems there is a rubber stopper that broke off? 


I can not work on my car. So I am taking it to a shop. 

But if that’s the issues, which I’m hoping someone can confirm, any idea what it will cost? 

Thank you. "

Popped my battery out of my car about 8-9 months ago, is it still usable?
Would I still be able to use this if it's been sitting in the garage? The battery itself was only used for like 2 months before my car broke down and I popped it out to fix the car (engine swap so it's been a lengthy process due to work and other obligations)"

Broken bolt while Changing water pump
2001 Silverado 2500hd 6.0v8

Background; active duty military, new base, no friends to help me yet, about to deploy, no auto parts shops close,


I was changing my water pump and broke a bolt, I have a left handed extractor set from auto zone and they just aren’t biting in and actually removing metal enough to do anything.

There isn’t enough material out nor do I have vise grips to grab it and break it loose.

I’m doing everything I can and just can’t seem to get it out.

I have a fresh set of gaskets (even a new bolt if I got it out) and gasket maker to add some more, what’s the chance that it would not leak if I was 1 bolt short of the 6? 

I just need it to last me until I deploy, then maybe a month until I get back get a new car then I can treat it as a project and care for it correctly then. Anything helps.

TLDR; can I make it work one bolt less until I can do a proper repair down the line?


Ended up just making it work since I got a flight that is very soon and it’s gonna become a me problem once I come back, but once I’m back ima do it right."

2018 F150 vibration
Hey all, hoping someone can help pin point an issue I am having. I have scoured the internet and have yet to find someone describing the same issue I am having. Sorry for the long read but thanks for your time in advance.

The vehicle: 2018 F150 supercrew cab with 6.5ft bed. 4WD. 3.5L Ecoboost engine. Max tow package. 78,000 miles.

The issue : At speeds over 60mph I feel a slight vibration. More so in the seat than the steering wheel. When I let off the gas, the vibration intensifies for about 2-3 seconds, then goes back down to slight vibration until I coast to below 60mph. If I get it up to say 70mph, shift to neutral, let off gas, the vibration again intensifies like before but a little worse and lasts longer. The instense vibration will continue until I coast down to 60 or below. When the vibration instensfies, it has a lower pitch then the slight vibration. I would say it feels like going over rumble strips at 40mph, though not as bad as rumble strips. Maybe 50% of that feeling.

- It cannot be wheel balance, hard spots, odd wear or anything like that cause that would not explain the increase in vibration when I let off the gas.

- The 2pc drive shaft looks fine to me, doesn't look like I am missing any balancing weights or anything. All u-joints appear to be tight. I did unbolt the drive shaft from the rear differential and removed it. Those u-joints rotate freely without slop though. Same for the one right near the carrier bearing. I unbolted the carrier bearing from the frame, spun it around. Spins like a dream with basically no noise.

- Turning the rear differential by hand feels fine. I don't know if it's excessive or not but there is some rotational play back and forth. Maybe 20 degrees? Idk. No up and down play though like a bearing is bad.

I planned on removing the rear differential cover to take a peak. However, on the 2nd bolt I broke free, the damn head broke off!!! I was using a standard 3/8 ratchet and didn't even apply that much pressure. So a lot more bolts to go, I was afraid more would break and I didn't have the time to fix all of them. (My main goal that day was to drop the transmission pan for filter change.)

I did throw an indicator on each drive shaft at front, middle, and rear. Max runout was 0.018"". Manual states 0.020"" is Max. So that's technically fine. 

I am at a loss here and so is every car/truck guy I talk to.

Any ideas?

Crankshaft Sensor
Hi, I need help diagnosing a recurring problem with my car.

Last year, I had to replace the crankshaft position sensor twice within a few weeks. Each time, the oil pressure warning light came on before the car broke down. The mechanic said the sensor was damaged, so it was replaced both times.

Now, one year later, the same thing happened again:

The oil pressure light came on,

I drove for a short distance,

The car broke down and won't start.


I checked the oil level—it’s fine.
I also inspected the area near the crankshaft sensor and found visible oil contamination mixed with dust and dirt around the sensor.

I suspect this leak may be damaging the sensor again.

What should I do now? Is it likely the sensor failed again due to the oil contamination?
Would replacing it again fix it, or is it more important to fix the leak first?

I have a labeled photo and a report if needed.

Thanks in advance!"

Should I worry? Car was just worked on
Hello. I have a 2017 Chevy Cruze Hatchback LT. I think it's a 1.4 liter engine. I've had it for about 6 years. My car decided to take a crap on me an hour away from home. Somehow managed to get it back on and drive it home. Long story short, had to take it to the dealership to get worked on. Turns out my vacuum pump seal broke which damaged my camshaft and made the brake booster lose all power. The tech told the service dept. person I was working with that he doesn't know how I drove it home. They replaced my camshaft, the vacuum pump, a pcv orifice pipe, my spark plugs, and required an oil change. I've had the car back for about a week or so now. I can physically feel how much better the car drives. It shifts better (not as much jerking), the car doesn't shake at 75+ mph anymore, it doesn't hesitate to go when I press on the gas pedal, no more rough idling. I'm happy! But... Sometimes when my auto stop feature starts, when I go to let off the brake it takes a second to crank on.. like it's not super crazy, but the auto stop feature should absolutely just be able to turn the engine on instantly right? I don't recall my car doing this before. Turning the car on from it being completely off is the same too. Sometimes it takes a second or two of cranking before kicking on. Could it just be that it's learning the new parts since it went God knows how long with broken ones? I've not been able to take it on a long drive yet, just 2-3 15 minute trips to and from work everyday and maybe the store around the corner. I've watched my battery voltages during it to see if it was battery related (still need to get into my trunk to check the actual battery to ensure it's tight-- it was messed with when I first broke down because we were trying to see why the car died). When driving I'm around 13-14.5 V and when the auto start kicks on it drops IMMEDIATELY to 12-12.5V but then charges up just fine when the car starts running again. So I don't think it's battery related. Everything else google says is something I have no clue how to check or just seems a bit confusing/not on the mark. Is this worth going back to the dealership about? Is this a wait and see type of thing? Worth getting the check engine light codes checked out? (The check engine light is NOT on but I read that it still can have codes thrown). Please help! Thank you so much in advance!"

Can I siphon the oil from my motor to change it?
I am broke as hell and I’m sick of just topping off my oil. I need a change and ya no I can’t afford the $150 it would cost me around here. Everyone I ask either talks to me like I’m an idiot for even thinking about it, other people know just as little about cars as I do.

I have a 2016 Chevy Cruze, I don’t have a jack I can’t lift my car and I have no friends or know anyone near me who has anything that can help.

Can I just stick a hose down into the motor and just siphon or suck the old oil out, change the filter, replace the oil and call it a day? Or is this actually a bad practice? Will it cause any harm to my engine? Why shouldn’t I do this? Is it at all reliable?

Starter Advice
TL;DR:
I’m like 90% sure it’s the starter motor. I’ve done a ton of troubleshooting on my own, but I’m not super familiar with cars, and I don’t know if I should suck it up and try to replace the starter myself (which looks like a full multi-hour pain), pay a mobile mechanic to do it, or just sell the truck and walk away.

Truck info:
2005 Chevy Colorado 5-cylinder RWD
~230,000 miles Austin, TX

What’s happening:
Truck won’t start. When I turn the key, I get one solid click, but the engine doesn’t crank at all. Battery is reading 12.3V and every other electronic works fine — lights, radio, AC, etc. This issue has happened 3-4 times before and after a few attempts of starting it worked. It failed the other day and It wouldn’t crank so i swapped out relays and right after it worked. I got it home, and then a day or so later I took it to firestone (i’m also having a power steering leek in the high pressure line) to get it diagnosed (for the high pressure leak it was only 10 dollars) and after bringing it home, waiting 4 days for the parts it has not started since. (karma for going to firestone I guess) 

When I go from OFF to ON, I hear a short high-pitched noise that stops once it’s fully in ON — I think that’s just the fuel pump priming, seems normal. No ongoing whining or weird sounds. When I go from START back to ON, I sometimes hear 1–2 clicks from what i think are different relays.

Here’s what I’ve done already:
	•	Swapped the starter relay with other relays (RAS, A/C) — it started one time and worked for like a couple different times when i started the car, then went back to the same issue.
	•	Checked all fuses and relays — nothing visibly blown.
	•	Cleaned battery terminals and checked connections — all good.
	•	Tried tapping the starter (as much as I could reach) — no response.
	•	Shook wiring harnesses running toward the starter — nothing changed.
	•	Fuel pump is definitely running. Ignition switch seems to be doing its job.
	•	All signs point to the starter solenoid clicking, but the motor not spinning.

What I know:
	•	The starter is located on the driver’s side, under the intake manifold and behind the wheel liner — horrible placement. I can’t really reach it without jacking up the truck and getting underneath and the book calls for a 5 hour process, but i’ve seen youtube videos of people managing to jerry rig it down to a 2 hour process through the wheel
	•	I’m not a mechanic and don’t have access to a lift, power tools, or experience doing this.
	•	I’m also broke — so calling a shop is kind of off the table and a mobile mechanic is also hard because of cost. I will be able to afford at max $500 dollars worth without digging deep. I can also ask family for help if it is needed.

My question:
Should I just go ahead and replace the starter myself, even though I don’t really know what I’m doing?
Should I call a mobile mechanic and pay them just to swap it (assuming that’s the issue)?
Or is this the point where I say screw it, sell the truck, and move on?

Appreciate any thoughts — especially from anyone who’s dealt with this specific engine/starter layout. It’s such a dumb spot for a part that dies this often."

Is it possible the mechanic broke my alternator or is it just a coincidence?
I took my car (Audi A3 2000) in for a standard service and one week later the alternator broke. It shut down out of nowhere no warning, no trouble starting the car, no dim headlights. It just stopped while I was driving.
The mechanic mentioned there was a leak when changing the oil and they had to clean it up. Is it possible this could have done something to the alternator when cleaning the engine?
I'm just wondering because the car is old and I'm confused as to whether it is just a coincidence or not "

Dropped it off at the dealer (in canada), January 2nd they say it needs a new pcm, backordered until mid January. That kept getting pushed later and later and now there is no eta. 

  
I don't know what to do here. My car is stuck until its fixed. I'm getting really annoyed with paying for a car that I don't have and by the time I get it back so many other things are going to be messed up from it sitting for so long.

I wonder what exactly did they do?


I was in an emergency and broke down out of nowhere on the way to work, couldn’t afford a tow and I was within the hour of having to come to work so I tried a near mechanic and took a Lyft to work. 

Before this I drove to AutoZone to see if I can purchase some coolant to see if that would resolve the problem and turns out I have a coolant leak. It was smoking and leaking just near the battery so I had to leave my car and use a mechanic I’m not familiar with. 

I didn’t get to get a receipt and refuse to pay to the whole labor fee for the repair because I feel like he just taped things up, am I happy to be back on the road? Sure but I didn’t want a bandaid.

Video evidence, the silver tape is where the problem was at, and the shiny black cover top and the part he claimed he had to switch out and replace.

Total was $690 

Did he just put a bandaid on the problem?

2007 Suburban with recurring air intake system problems
Couple of years ago I had to change my throttle body, a couple weeks after that… my truck broke down and mechanic said the MAF sensor needed replacing. 

Fast forward to now the same issues came up. Truck went into limp mode, replaced throttle body. Fine for two weeks then limp mode again and new MAF sensor.

1. Just wondering if anyone else has had recurring issues around these parts? 

2. To me it doesn’t seem like a coincidence, is it possible that something else is causing these parts to fail?

Note: Everything was recalibrated both times, there are no leaks in the hoses and prior to replacing the throttle body (each time) the other parts (MAF) were checked and deemed fine.

Thank you for any comments if you’re able to.

2008 Kia Sedona trans issues?
my 2008 Kia broke down. I think it’s the transmission. For a while now it’s been doing a thing where it’s slow to go into 1st gear. When I start it in the morning it works, unless I stop too soon before it warms up and then it revs up barely going into gear. For a while I was driving it fine after it warmed up. But in the last few days I noticed more irregularities in the gear changing and acceleration. And today it turned really sluggish on the freeway and broke down. It starts up now and I can drive it slowly a couple blocks but it’s basically undrivable. I think maybe it’s the transmission and not the sparks. Maybe the filter which is tedious to replace. I’ll probably just scrap it because it’s not worth putting much money into. ￼￼I try checking the trans fluid but the liquid is all the way up the stick. I added maybe a liter a few months ago becaus it looked very low but it was hard to tell. "

All 4 Cylinders misfiring with random misfire, as well as P0351 - 0354
2002 Toyota Camry LE 2.4L 4 inline cylinder. 

I’ve been trying to figure this out for a while but it seems like a myriad of issues and I don’t know where or how to begin with fixing it. So I’ll list of things that I’ve noticed about the car and go from there.

Apparently valve cover gasket leak, as I’ve noticed oil on the coil packs when they’re set in the spark plug well, as well as some seepage around where the valve cover gasket is.

I did replace the spark plugs with iridium spark plugs from autozone, but did a stupid thing and got some ignition coils off Amazon (point and laugh at me I know.)

After getting gas, the car will turn on, but then turn off unless you hit the gas pedal, then it stays on and is drive-able. 

Oddly enough there’s times where the check engine light has shut off a couple of times and the car ran a lot smoother before turning back on. 1st time it was off for a day.. then the second occurrence it stayed off for about 2 days.

Overall, I’m looking to see what my options are and could be, as well as maybe learning some new things. I’m really doing my best, I don’t know a lot about cars but this is important to me as it’s for my mom. Thank you guys."

LBZ duramax p0087
I’m scratching my head over here, first duramax and I’ve always been a cummins guy but I unfortunately know more about this damn motor than any other 12 valve I’ve worked on at this point. Making this post to see if anyone has some insight on my issue. I’m chasing the p0087 code and have been for a couple of months now. Truck was purchased and it was leaking fuel from the valley, tore down to cp3 and found a line that looked to have been nicked with a grinder. Replaced all rubber hoses with 3/8 fuel line and fixed leak. Code persisted. Deleted factory fuel filter housing and added lift pump, code persisted, ran new fuel lines from pump to cab, still have the code. One of the first things I fixed was the fprv (before I had any kind of fuel monitoring) did the ppe shim kit with two shims. Still had the issue.

Long story short, my desired rail pressures aren’t matching my actual pressures with any kind of throttle or boost. I’ve narrowed my issue down to my drivers side fuel rail. I’ve tried several combinations of plugs and fprv’s all with different results to the actual fuel pressures. When I installed a factory valve from another motor (with o ring) I was able to hit 18k actual, when installed with 3 shims without o ring I was hitting 15k. Installed a ppe race valance without o ring and hit 18k, took off o ring and hit 20k, tightened it monkey tight and hit 22k. Can anyone tell me what in the world is going on? Bad valve? Bad rail? Haven’t tried a new oem bosch but I’m tired of throwing parts at it. Pic of the shitbox for attention"

BMW overheating, water pump missing?
2014 BMW 535i (F10, N55 engine) car is in excellent condition and reliable to the max until 3 days ago when the car started overheating.  Checked coolant level, was very minimal low, just below the min level, I topped it off and drove again with no issues. I even tried max AC in hot weather and aggressive driving, still no overheating issues, I drove for another day and no issues. 

3rd day, today, again started overheating while driving on the freeway. No check engine lights, but decided to scan it and it gave me code 20A909 (water pump missing). I had the car towed home and ordered a new water pump and thermostat which will arrive tomorrow. 

I wanted to start taking the old pump off tonight but though to test it again, code is gone. And the water pump is working (the coolant is flowing in the reservoir as the pump circulates the coolant) I checked the pump connection and all are intact and nothing loose. I drove the car and no overheating.

The question is, is this the pump acting up intermittently going out? Or is this an electrical issue? 

The car has 140k miles and I am not sure if the pump has ever been replaced but I can say that I owned the car for the last 7 years and 80k miles and I have never had it replaced. I’m tempted to just replace the pump and thermostat considering it’s time for them to go out anyways. But I am not sure if there is an undiagnosed electrical issue that I should be looking more into."

My car eats coolant and I want to know the reason why
Hello so I’ve been having overheating issues with my 2012 dodge charger SE, it has about 150k miles. For about the past two months I’ve been purchasing universal coolant bottles every week, depending on how much i drive i go through about 1-2 of these a week. It performs normally when it’s freshly refills, the temperature never fluctuates below its standard ~197°F. But once it crosses the threshold it will fluctuate between 210°-240°+. When driving i don’t believe the rpm’s on the motor correlate much with how much the temperature increases or decreases i could be going the same speed for about 10 minutes and the temperature will change between the variables. I’m not sure if going uphill or downhill effects it much however i do think braking or turning effects it the most but not by a drastic amount, maybe just a coincidence. The engine oil temp is stable regardless the coolant temp fluctuates. I tried leaving the engine idle to see if it was my radiator fan and it did continue to rise. A interesting detail i noticed was that the transmission temp changes, this was just a few minutes ago when i noticed this and inclined me to make this post so i don’t have a large sample size because the coolant was already at 240°. Between park and neutral the transmission temp was reading about the same as the coolant at 240° but with drive and reverse the transmission temp was reading at about 159°. Maybe this has nothing to do with it but if anybody would be able to give me advice it would be greatly appreciated. "

Once i did the oil change , the transmission started to lag to grab the ""D"" it would take like 2/3 seconds to grab the gear.

so i said well maybe its low on transmission oil. I did another transmission oil change to make sure the levels are correct.

I did it. the problem continued and now a check engine light came on and this code came back:

Code P2714 Pressure Control Solenoid ""D"" Performance/Stuck Off

Can anyone point me in the right direction on how to repair this issue? Do i need to drop the pan and clean it? Do i need another transmission oil change? do i have to replace or just clean the solenoid?"

Carburetor experts front of the line!
1981 Chevy Suburban -

So in the last six months I’ve replaced the transmission then the engine. Got it running with a new carburetor but I’m having issues. I can’t figure out if it’s a timing issue or fuel issue. It starts fine. Idles fine. I can go 65 down the highway fine. Whether I’m sitting or going down the road if you hit the accelerator too hard it’s like it bogs down. Almost as if it’s not getting fuel, or if something’s in the line. I moved over the fuel pump from my old motor. As far as I know there was nothing wrong with it. I cleaned it and the line itself. I even installed the fuel filter that came with the new carburetor. Nothing can be seen in the fuel filter that would suggest there’s a blockage. On the carb itself I can hit the throttle and visually see fuel squirting evenly into the front two barrels. I’ve used a vacuum gauge to ensure I’m pulling the highest vacuum possible. Also the distributor vacuum is hooked up to full vacuum and not ported. I don’t know if the floats need adjusted or maybe my timings off a bit. Any suggestions? I’ll put my motor specs below.

New 2024 Nissan Pathfinder driver seat tilt
Hi,

I'm new to here and have something to share or seek some advices. I bought a demo Nissan Pathfinder early this year which already had around 1,000km. The car drives well overall but from day one I felt something strange with the driver seat. At first I thought maybe it’s just because it’s a new car. But after time, it actually got worse especially when driving longer than about 30 minutes — I started feeling pain in my right hip and lower back. It was bad enough that I had to buy an extra cushion and lumbar support just to manage short drives.

I reported this issue to my dealer three times and visited twice but all they did was refit the seat and tell me to go home because they didn’t have a spare part or a loan car. Because the seat always felt like it was tilting to the right I used a level tool myself to measure it — it clearly shows the seat base is uneven and tilted down on the right side. I couldn't upload in this thread so I just published in youtube: https://youtu.be/rDhng374zfE

Is this likely to be a genuine defect? What could be the cause — seat frame, cushion, or rail alignment? And has anyone fixed a similar problem successfully on a Pathfinder or similar SUV?

Any advice who knows car well or anyone with experience would be really appreciated. Thanks!"

Annoying noise :(
Hello, I’m a 17 year old high schooler and my dad, has been having issues with our car. Since some months ago, our car- a Nissan Versa Note SV 2014, has been making this sound when we step on the brakes while the car is on drive mode. This only happens when the car is on drive and stopped. Please, any advice is appreciated and helpful. My dad is pretty disappointed, he had taken the car to the mechanic a while back to get this annoying sound gone but what was fixed did not make the noise go away. He then went and got some advice and was told it was the car’s suspension that was causing this problem. He took it to the mechanic again and got the suspension fixed for $1100, the sound was gone for 2 days but now it’s back. My dad has spent around $1400-1500 trying to get this noise gone. We don’t know who to go to for help. This is my first time using reddit and I don’t want my dad to continue to be sad about this. He wants to do some uber driving with it but is embarrassed about people having to hear this noise and later give the car to me once he buys a new one. Please help us :(

Thank you to everyone who takes the time to read this post, and I hope you all have a good morning, afternoon or evening. :)"

AC only Blowing Cold Air on Passenger Side
Hey there Reddit mechanics!

  
Long story short - My AC only blows cold air on the passenger side. Heat works just fine on both sides. 

I have a 2018 Accord with Dual Climate Control. driver's side just blows the fans when I set the temp low. I was told it may be my blend door actuator, so I took a look at my driver's side one to see if anything looked off. I don't actually know what I'm meant to be looking for, but it seems like it's working and may not be the cause of the issue? (video attached) Any advice? I'm a pretty DIY kind of guy, but is this something I may just have to pass along to an actual mechanic? Last thing - I'm considering changing the driver's side blend door anyways since it's a cheap part and seems like an easy job. Not sure if that's a waste of time though."

""lazy"" gas pedal?
I have no idea how else to properly explain this issue to any of the car people in my life. What happens with my Nissan Altima 2015, only sometimes, when I'm at a stop sign is sort of a ""lag"" of roughly 1 second where I have the gas pedal fully pressed down and no movement. After that odd second passes the engines rpm goes from below 1 all the way to 4, and movement goes back to normal.

Could anyone help me discover what the issue may be? Appreciate the help."

Intermittent Steering Wobble While Braking
I'm having an issue with my 2014 Nissan Pathfinder where I sometimes get a wobble in the steering wheel while braking. My first thought was warped rotors, but I would think that would cause a more consistent wobble. I've also noticed that there is some feedback in the steering wheel when going over a bump while cornering. Also when I am going straight at highway speed, if I tap the wheel to the left as if I was going to swerve around something, there is some resistance in the wheel. The same doesn't happen if I tap it to the right. Is my power steering failing? Nothing obviously looks wrong with the front end, but I'm also not entirely sure what I'm looking for."

Cooling issue on 2009 bmw 323i
Hey everyone,

I’m having an issue with my 2009 BMW 323i and was hoping someone here might have some insight.

Basically, the radiator fan kicks on when the coolant temp hits around 200°F, but then it immediately ramps up to max speed and just stays there — doesn’t turn off or slow down at all.

Letting it idle, the temp hovers around 210°F, and while steady driving, it drops a bit to around 206°F, but the fan is still screaming the whole time. Car isn’t overheating, no warning lights or anything, just this fan going nuts.

Here’s what I’ve done so far: 
•	Coolant level is good 
•	Burped the system properly to rule out air pockets 
•	Checked the water pump — when I put the car in accessory mode, I can see it circulating coolant in the reservoir 
•	Replaced the coolant temp sensor — no change 
•	Radiator seems to be doing its job — coolant coming back is just above ambient temp

So now I’m stuck. Could it be a stuck thermostat? Faulty fan controller? Not really sure where to go from here and don’t want to just keep throwing parts at it.

Any help would be appreciated!"

Bought an old boat, is this just a wheel bearing issue?
Bought an ‘89 bowrider boat and the trailer wheel is toed out quite a bit. When examining I see the bearing is sitting on the spindle and absolutely destroyed. Certainly won’t be moving this without a fix. When I did tow it, it made a metal on metal noise. Is this likely just a bearing? Any chance the axel is toast from driving it like this?

I know the bearing is toast but, just wondering in some expert opinions on whether it’s likely worse than that. "

Are these rotors and brakes ok? Factory rotors 240k miles.
Never changed brake pads since I bought the car from a dealer at 136k miles. 

70k miles ago I had a mechanic look at my brakes since they would screech on and off only with the wheel turned all the way.

At around 170k miles the mechanic told me my brakes were metal on metal, that I need new rotors and pads, that it was unsafe to continue driving with those brakes. I decline to change them, never had issues since but still get screeching wheels turned all the way.

2023 F-150 3.5 Ecoboost whistle on idle
Hi all, we are currently looking at buying a 2023 F150 3.5Ecoboost with 32k miles on it. When I popped the hood I noticed this whistle noise. On start up there is no whistle but once the RPMS drop in its idle the whistle noise comes out. When I press on the peddle to increase the RPMS the whistle would get higher pitched. This is with and without AC on. We had their tech listen and he said its typical engine noises and could be a multitude of things but not to worry about it. Am I over reacting to this or is this indicating an issue with the vehicle?"

Also, the A/C will always turn on in the morning. However, after sitting in a hot parking lot all day it will not work properly. The A/C in the rear will work and run fine, but the A/C in the front will not blow.

97 7.3 trans issues

1997 f250 7.3l with the e4od trans

Edited post: because truck turned on again. Wasn’t related to the trans issue as I thought. 



(Sorry in advance this is long but please, 7.3 gurus, im at a loss) 




Just got this old beater, tons of stuff wrong but planned to fix as I go. I realized I have a leak from the dipstick the other day. Nothing crazy but Was low,  read on the Cold line when hot

I threw in a half a quart of trans fluid and planned to get the ats trans dipstick adapter Friday when I get paid 

A day passes, drove maybe 4 miles like this and Last night as im pulling into my road and the trans just disengaged. No sounds, nothing.  just stops

Shut it off and put it in gear and it goes. 

But stops again and I get in front of my house. 

Shut it off, turn it on, put it in reverse and it slowly lists into my driveway. Check the trans fluid and it reads over full on hot (which it was warmed up all the way)

Had a coworker pick me up.After work I Start it and again won’t go into gear, stuck in park this time 

I turn it off. Turn it back on and now it shifts. Put it through all the gears in park and check the fluid running and it says its above hot reading

So I shut it off and drain the half a quart I put in the other night

Turn it on and it won’t shift into any gear🤬

Turn it off, turn it on, and this time it doesn’t fix it, stays not shifting 

Can anyone tell me what this is indicative of? 

It shifted perfectly fine before this "

Power steering noise when turning (idle or slowly)
So car has suddenly started making some noises when turning but only when idling or moving <15kms..

Normal driving don't really hear any noise though. I have checked the fluid but it's still full.

It does have a slightly weak under charging alternator but does it seem like a ps pump issue? - I'm confused as no noise when driving normally but the steering is a bit stiff.

My 2014 Ford Fusion Hybrid Nightmare (But I’m Fighting Back)
so i’ve been dealing with my 2014 ford fusion hybrid titanium (non plug-in) and it’s been a nightmare. the car wouldn’t start, even with a brand new 12v battery that was fully charged. it would drain super fast and kept dying. first i assumed it was the dc to dc converter so i replaced it myself, then i noticed the coolant was low even though i had just changed it like 2 months ago, turns out the hybrid cooling pump was bad too so i ordered that and replaced it too. after both were installed the car still wouldn’t crank but the lights were on and it would try. the hybrid display was dead and it kept saying “stop safely now.” i did the under hood and under seat jump process, let it bleed, tried to get the system to reset and nothing worked. i scanned it and got codes like u2101 for control module configuration, plus codes for the steering switch, battery monitoring module, and some other bs. the radio would flicker and glitch, traction and hill assist lights were on, everything was acting up. eventually i got the 12v to stop dying so i knew something was at least working better but still no crank.

i tried trickle charging, did ignition cycles, the check engine light hasn’t come back, and i’ve been using the forscan app and scanner to read and clear codes but the hybrid battery is showing like 90v and not charging. finally took it to a shop and they said they jumped the hv battery and got it to respond but it wouldn’t hold the charge and now they’re saying it’s the transmission. they said the trans is tied into the charging system from the inverter to the 12v to the hv so the car can’t function right without it. they also said they heard a knocking sound between the trans and motor and they want to replace the whole thing for like 5k.

now the car started overheating, which didn’t happen before the shop tried programming something. it says coolant over temp, jerks at certain speeds, but still turns on and off. i’ve replaced basically everything, it’s charging correctly now, and it did go into ready mode a few times before completely dying again. i’m just trying to figure out if this is all trans related or if it’s still a programming/module issue. i’ve done all this as a single mom just trying to get my kid to school and keep going and i’m honestly just at my breaking point with this car. has anyone else had this issue before or anything even close to this? i’m just trying to figure out if there’s any hope left or if i should just trade it in and start over."

My 2014 Ford Fusion Hybrid Nightmare (But I’m Fighting Back)
so here’s the whole rundown on what i’ve been dealing with — my 2014 ford fusion hybrid titanium (non plug-in) has been through it and i’ve tried just about everything myself before finally taking it to a shop. if anyone’s had this happen or is dealing with it, here’s what i went through:
	•	the car wouldn’t start, even though the 12v battery was new and charged. i assumed it was the DC-DC converter so i replaced it.
	•	then i realized the coolant was low, even though it was recently changed. turns out, the hybrid cooling pump wasn’t working either, so i ordered and replaced that too.
	•	once both parts were installed, the car still wouldn’t crank. dash lights came on, but no ready mode. got the “stop safely now” warning and the hybrid system was completely dead on the display.
	•	i did manual bleeds and also used both under-hood and under-seat jump procedures. tried letting it sit, tried resets — nothing worked.
	•	got a code U2101 (module config incompatible) along with battery monitoring module bus errors, and others like B1380 for steering controls. radio would glitch and flicker, ABS/traction/hill assist lights stayed on.
	•	tried doing a trickle charge and kept my 12V stable — it wasn’t dying anymore like it was when the converter was bad, so that told me power was flowing correctly now.
	•	still no hybrid function or start.

finally took it to a shop, and they told me the transmission is likely the issue — apparently the inverter and transmission are tied together to help push power between the HV and 12V systems. they jumped the HV and got it to respond temporarily, but the HV wouldn’t hold charge. they also said they heard a knocking between the trans and engine. 😩

then it started overheating while driving, which didn’t happen before the shop “programmed” a module. now it says motor coolant over temp and jerks at certain speeds.

i’ve installed:
	•	new 12V battery
	•	new DC-DC converter
	•	new hybrid cooling pump
	•	bled the system
	•	tried FORScan and scanning modules (still working on full module reset)
	•	no check engine light now, and the HV battery shows up but reads low (voltage was around 90v at one point)

they tried charging the HV at the shop and said it still won’t hold power. now they want to replace the entire transmission, quoting me like $5K. 🥴

i’m a single mom, trying to stay afloat and get my kid to school. this car has stressed me all the way out. just wanted to share what i’ve done and see if anyone else has experienced anything close to this.

my questions:
	•	could all this be caused by a trans issue?
	•	could it just need the HV module reset or proper FORScan initialization?
	•	has anyone seen a low HV battery cause all of this before?

appreciate any help — and honestly just needed to vent too 💔

Kia rondo repeated issue
So I've taken my car to the shop now a number of times. Intially the car was overheating and eventually stopped, but it was still on and blowing air, everything, it just wouldn't drive. so they changed the water pump then the entire thermostat housing and then they said it was just faulty sensors.

 This was in May, now it's July and it's not overheating, but they said it was actually blowing too cold on the engine but as long as it wasn't overheating it's fine. 

Now, randomly last night I turned on the car and while I was putting in directions on my phone, i felt the engine stop, but the car was still on and the ac was still blowing. The oil, battery, and break light are on and the check engine light has been on because they said it's just the sensor but nothing is wrong. I just got an oil change thinking that would help, and I'm driving and it stopped. It was also stalling at the lights and I felt like it was having trouble getting the speed up. 

I noticed a leak the other day too, but I can't tell what it's from. 

I've already put almost $2000 into fixes only for none of it to work. Can someone please give me an idea of what it is and what I should do at this point. I've been going to Firestone but they're just taking money and not fixing anything. "

Air Conditioning Issues
 Hi all, 

I am looking for a bit of advice. Car is a 2014 Nissan cube. About 2 months ago the blower motor on our AC went out, and that was on us. The filter had probably never been changed, and it just overtaxed the motor and it burned out. Shortly after that fix the AC would turn on but there was no freon, we tried one of those cans and it leaked out within an hour. Just all the way back to empty. Took it back to the same mechanic, and they did the dye test, and found a leak with the evaporator. We had to wait a while to be able to afford that fix because the whole dash had to come out. When we took it into them to get it fixed, it took almost 2 weeks for them to complete the job. I know it is a difficult job because of the dash, but they had said it would be 6 to 7 hours l, kept promising it would be the next day, the next day, don't call us we will call you, and there was little to no communication as to why it ended up taking two weeks. I lost pay for two weeks of work. When we got it back, parts of the siding were not affixed properly, there was stuff still sticking out from beneath part of the console, that insulation stuff which I am not sure what it is, near the shift, and more importantly, and why I am here, while the driver and passenger vent blew extremely well and cold, the two vents at the center of the console through extremely lightly. Blowing cold, but not even strong enough to blow out a candle. Almost feels like the vents are blocked? Or not aligned? 

When I went to look around, I noticed they had attached one of the side fuse boxes sideways, and that only cemented the idea that they did not know how to put the dash back together once they took it apart. It all fell into place, realizing that that is why it took 2 weeks. So I do not trust taking it back to them. We also don't have the money to have another mechanic take it apart and put it back together properly. Some of the side pieces I can fix, they were as simple as just snapping them back on. But the two console vents are the problem. Rotating the knob which changes where the air blows works fine, the heat works fine, the defrosters work fine, it is just like those two are blocked somehow. I know nothing about this part so apologies if this sounds dense, but could I stick a camera into those two vents and see if the doors are just not opening to the vents on the inside? Is there any advice, or a suggestion on what I can do to fix this myself?"

Brake whomping sound
Hi guys!

A few months back, I changed my rear pads, rotors and callipers on my 2015 Mazda CX-5 due to the right one getting stuck.

Now, they brake great, and haven’t noticed any wear issues, but sometimes (normally when it’s colder, early mornings, late nights) I hear an almost ‘whomping’ sound, like it’s wobbling, and it gets way louder when I apply the brakes(or pull my ebrake). it goes away after about a minute of driving.

I’ve checked all my lug nuts, and just got my wheels balanced and rotated, so I’m pretty confident it’s something to do with the brakes, it’s on the right side where my calliper went bad. Any ideas? Thanks!"

Noise when Accelerating
Hey guys, I went to a mechanic and changed engine timing belt thinking it would fix this whining sound issue. Any thoughts on what this could be? My mechanic said this is normal and this is how Jeeps sound, but I don’t remember my car sounding like this when I am driving and accelerating less than 25mph. This noise just all of a sudden started to get stronger and stronger. I drive a 2016 Jeep Patriot Latitude. Should I get a second opinion?

Intermittent AC on '13 Dodge Ram
Ill preface this with I am not a mechanic, so my knowledge is limited.

Having an issue with my AC, on my 2013 Ram 1500 3.6L. AC is intermittent, and can start and stop based on bumps in the road.

A firm ""tap"" on the Fuse Box seems to fix it as well. I've noticed the fuse is getting excessive heat on one of the pins, so I replaced the fuse for the blower motor, as well as the blower motor relay with no success.

Ive also checked what I believe is the blower motor resistor (not sure if thats the correct term) its a part behind the glove box that youtube told me over time can get corroded or melt due to intermittent arcing of contacts, seemed to be in good shape.

Not sure what other options I have. Ive pulled up the TIPM and pulled off the wire harness directly under the blower motor fuse, however I now understand just because that is the location of the fuse, because the TIPM is a board, that doesn't necessarily mean that is the wire harness with the wires in question.

So a few questions,

1. Does darkening around one contact on the fuse indicate a bad connection between the TIPM and the fuse? Or could that be caused by an electrical problem anywhere in the system.
2. Based on the fact that a bump or tapping on the fuse box will fix the problem, could the issue be a lose connection in the wiring harness, and if so, how can I identify which harness it may be.
3. Is a total TIPM replacement something I should try? Or is that above the level of a DIYer.
4. Any other suggestions before I take it in to a real professional."

Transmission drain & fill on 2013 Mini Cooper Countryman S (86k miles) — smart or risky?
Hey everyone,
I bought my 2013 Mini Cooper Countryman S back in October with 73k miles. She’s now at 86k and running great. I give her 93 octane gas, high mileage European oil, and I try to stay ahead on maintenance.

Lately I’ve been researching whether I should do a transmission drain and fill. No issues at the moment—just thinking proactively. From what I’ve found, this car uses Pentosin ATF1 (or an equivalent spec), and a drain and fill typically removes about 4 quarts even though the total system holds around 6 quarts.

I’m trying to take good care of her so she takes care of me for years to come. Would love to hear from anyone who’s done this service around this mileage—good idea or unnecessary risk?

Thanks in advance for any advice or personal experiences!"

2020 Jeep Compass Error Code Help
Hi,

I have a 2020 Jeep Compass that has 107,818 miles on it. It has absolutely shit the bed and crank but won't start. I had a company mechanic look at it. The error codes we received were U1428, P2111, PO123, PO222, and PO113. After running those codes into google alot of the issues were related to the throttle, or throttle body. A lot were also sensors. I was wondering if you guys can help me ballpark these repairs so I don't get robbed, or come up with a plan of action.

I am looking to sell this car. I have a little left on it, and I drive way too much for work. My fear is I will fix it and within 2 months it will be broken down again. I can drive up to 200 miles a day for work. Please advise. Any help is appreciated. Thanks everyone!

🛻 low oil and high temperature readings appear and disappear together    
🛻 airbag light is suddenly flashing as I write this but I think that is going to be something unrelated   

I took it to a mechanic and of course the oil light and radiator light wouldn’t come on for him on the test drive; he told me that there was white coming out of the tailpipe because it was ‘condensation’ and that I had low oil on the dipstick because women don’t change their oil enough.

Silverado suspension issue PLEASE HELP
Long story short, I put a cheap 3” level kit on my 2016 Silverado 1500 LT rwd about a year and a half ago. Rode fine for a while, then the driver side upper ball joint burst through the top of the control arm. I took it to a shop where they replaced both upper control arms and gave me an alignment. Rode fine for a couple months. Then both upper ball joints busted open causing my alignment to be off and the wheels to camber outward. Brought it to the same shop where they replaced the spindles with lifted ones, both upper and lower control arms, and swap bar links. It’s only been two weeks and the ball joint on the driver side has busted again as-well as both front wheels are cambered outward with an alignment issue. I have no clue what to do in the situation I genuinely just want my truck to drive straight for a single goddamn month. I think the shop may have forgotten my cam bolt brackets. The photo included is an older photo before control arms were replaced but shows I used to have the brackets on the vehicle. However I can no longer find them on the truck."

2018 Forester Flashing Cruise Control Light
Hey folks!

Looking for a bit of advice as what could be causing an issue I’ve been experiencing for the last couple days.

I have a 2018 Forester with roughly 165,000 km on it. I was driving the other day and tried to turn on cruise control but I could not get it to set the speed. I wasn’t too bothered with it as I rarely ever use it but since then after driving for a little while the cruise control light will turn on and start flashing. It goes away when I turn the car off and doesn’t turn itself on all the time, only at what seems to be random times.

There are no other lights on the dash other than a blind spot detection system light as the sensors stopped working about a year ago, this hasn’t ever seemed to mess with the cruise control in the past. The check engine light isn’t on which seems to go hand in hand with the flash CC from I seen from some googling.

I’m just trying to get an idea as to what could be triggering this, as I don’t have a ton of cash at the moment to bring it in and get it looked at.

Appreciate any and all help"

18 Dodge Charger 392 Help
Hey all, hoping someone here can help me narrow this down. I’ve been chasing down some persistent issues with my 2018 Dodge Charger SRT 392 (6.4L HEMI) and I feel like I’m going in circles trying to fix it. The main symptoms I’ve been dealing with are a low idle when the vehicle is in Drive and at idle/park— it drops down to around 500 RPM — and the car feels shaky or jittery, especially through the steering wheel at idle and at speed but mostly when speeding up. I also get exhaust pops when decelerating or in Street mode. Sometimes when I floor it or accelerate hard, it doesn’t feel like the car is responding with the power it should, even though the power and torque gauges show high output. After driving for a while, the idle can stumble, and the car feels like it’s about to stall when coming to a stop.

So far, I’ve replaced the spark plugs and coil packs, installed a new PCV valve and added an oil catch can. I also installed a new throttle body. I found some oil inside the intake after hard driving and cleaned it out. I replaced the PCV gaskets and the related tube gaskets as well. I did a full compression test on all cylinders and the results were solid with no major dropouts. I haven’t found any obvious vacuum leaks. I’ve monitored live fuel trim data before and after all this work.

Currently, STFT on Bank 2 still dips to around -10.9% while idling in Drive. LTFT for Bank 2 stays around 0%, while Bank 1 seems to stay closer to normal with a slight positive long-term trim. Idle RPMs in Drive remain low, between 500–525, and the vehicle still shakes when sitting still, especially after warming up. No check engine lights or misfire codes have popped up, and O2 sensors seem to be cycling normally, though I haven’t yet swapped them between banks. I haven’t done a smoke test yet. I have a set of new fuel injectors ready to install next, but I’m holding off in case there’s something I’m missing.

What I’m trying to figure out is whether this could still be a leaky or stuck injector on Bank 2, or if it could be something like a weak upstream O2 sensor, a fuel pressure issue. Motor mounts have been checked when revving. They appear to be fine. Is it heat-related or a sensor acting up once warm.

I’ve probably spent a good month chasing this issue down and just want to get the car running right again. If anyone’s experienced something similar or has any ideas I haven’t tried, I’d really appreciate the help. Thanks in advance."

HELP my car is freaking out! Electrical Issue? NO Battery Light, But Weird Behavior
Car: 2002 Lexus LS 430 UL | Mileage: 195k
Battery: Brand new Costco battery (installed 3–4 months ago)

Everything had been working perfectly — until today.

This morning when I started the car, the steering wheel didn’t extend out like it normally does (the telescopic/tilt feature stopped working). I didn’t think much of it and drove 1 mile to get groceries. On the way back — after driving another mile — right as I parked, the Check VSC and ABS lights turned on.

I started panicking, so I kept the car running and drove the 1 mile back home. At a red light, the radio cut out, all the interior lights dimmed, and the gauge cluster flickered off and on. As I got home and reversed into my parking spot, the A/C also shut off and came back on.

The serpentine belt is not broken or loose, I checked.

Now here’s the weird part:
The battery light never came on — not during the drive, not when idling, and not even in accessory mode (key on, engine off).
But I do know the battery light used to work — I found an old photo from about 4,000 miles ago where it was clearly on during accessory mode. But NOW it doesn’t even come on at ALL, regardless of engine running or not.

Also keep in mind that:

	•	Battery terminals are spotless
	•	I’m using dielectric grease and anti-corrosion washers (red/green)
	•	Car’s been totally fine until this sudden issue

Any idea what could be going on? And why do I not have a battery light, cuz I thought it’s supposed to tell you if alternator is bad.

Did I mess up?
So I have a 1994 Mercury Cougar Xr7 with the 4.6l modular V8. This is my first car, I’ve had it for a little over a year now and it has given me little to no issues so far, I try my best to keep it as clean and well maintained as possible, but I’m worried that I might have messed up. Last week it had no issues and everything was normal, however on Sunday me and my brothers took it on a spirited drive (nothing crazy just had some fun at a couple stoplights with a random Honda.) but on Monday when I drove it to work I noticed that the oil pressure was just a little lower than normal but I didn’t think much of it as it was still well within the normal range. But over the past couple days as I kept driving, it seemed to keep dropping slightly. So I decided to check the oil and when I did, my heart sank, as there was nothing on the dipstick. So I immediately put a quart in and it went right back to normal on the stick, and the oil pressure went back up to normal. However, I figured I might as well check the coolant while I was under the hood and I noticed that it looked dirty. Could it be the head gaskets? I thought it might be but it’s not smoking or running rough at all. I also check my oil pretty regularly and I know for a fact that it didn’t use any before this.

Realistic cost for timing chain replacement + transmission fluid service on Discovery Sport 2.0 Si4 (EcoBoost)?
Hi everyone,
I’m considering buying a 2016 Land Rover Discovery Sport 2.0 Si4 (EcoBoost 240 HP) with 159,000 km (~99,000 miles). The car starts and runs, but there’s a clear metallic ticking noise at cold start, which I believe is related to the timing chain or tensioner — a common issue on this engine.

Also, there’s no evidence that the automatic transmission fluid has ever been changed, and the car had 4 previous owners.

I’d like to ask:
	1.	What’s the realistic cost for a full timing chain replacement (chain, guides, tensioner, seals, oil) on this engine in a shop?
	2.	How much should I expect to pay for a complete ATF change (fluid + filter + pan)?
	3.	Is it risky to drive a few thousand more km with this ticking sound? Or is failure imminent?

Bonus: if anyone had this job done in Europe/UK, especially Italy, I’d appreciate local price ranges.

Thanks a lot!

Condenser fan running all the time after repair.
\[2006 Civic\] I had my entire HVAC high side replaced. Compressor, condenser, and lines. That lasted 6 months until the compressor died and was replaced. Then it died AGAIN after a month, and was replaced. The current one is holding up at 2 months, but now I've got a few related problems.

For one, the condenser fan runs ALL the time. With the AC off and the car having sat for days, the fan will come on as soon as the key hits the ""on"" position. They said that's normal, but it just seems like someone hardwired the fan.

Second, I took the car for its first longer trip, and after an hour, the blower fan speed slowed to a drizzle. I could tell it was still cold, but it wasn't blowing air around the cabin. After letting the car sit, it seemed to reset itself and go back to normal. I brought it back to the shop for this, but they couldn't replicate the issue.

Should I have my transmission fluid changed or not? A little nervous
2020 Silverado 1500 4.3 with 196k miles. I drive a lot for work. It runs pretty good as far as I'm concerned, but it does get hot during a long trip or a lot of stop and go traffic. Sometimes, but not often, I will experience a delay in acceleration if I press the gas too hard. More often the issue I have is shifting gears, and this vibrating every so often even just cruising, like the rear axle was dragging or getting caught. Checked differential fluid, was almost dry, so I filled that up with lucas oil and the vibrating/dragging stopped. I realize this morning after a lot of reading that I have neglected several aspects of maintenance. 

I was going to get a transmission fluid and filter change today (this would be the first one it has had), but after seeing other posts about changes in high mileage vehicles or with vehicles that already have a suspect transmission, is it worth changing it at this point?

How worried should I be? 2012 subaru outback 2.5L issues
the AT oil temp light came on along with other lights that regularly come on due to the catalytic converter (flashing cruise, check engine, flashing brake, and vehicle dynamics control). The AT oil temp has never come on before and if i would turn the car off and back on again it would disappear and come back on about 5 minutes later. I just had issues with a coolant leak that a mechanic couldn't find but hasn't come back (it might be the AC??) and he said that my coolant sensor is shorting and he recommended a coolant flush but those both were not urgent. Just before the AT oil temp light started coming on the car started jumping forward along with a dip and rise in rpm's when starting from a stop (i'd guess going from first to second gear, it's an automatic). i saw on another post that it could be a valve body but i'm not sure. the coolant issue was 3 hours into a roadtrip, and the lurching and AT oil temp light started happening two days after. there is also occasionally a rattling coming from the back when accelerating and it's worse when there's more weight in the car, and i have a recommendation to change the rear differential fluid. should i spend the money and get this all checked out at a mechanic??

Honda Fit speculation - back from the dead?
2010 Honda fit base manual. 240k miles. Driving back from the desert last week AC started blowing hot air.  Along with a loud scraping noise coming and going even with AC turned off. Kept driving home. Got up the next day and it wouldn't start. Car was slow cranking but not turning over. Note In the last year there has been a slight grinding noise when starting (not all the time mostly when car was sitting for a day). So contacted my mechanic. Tested the battery it was fine. Tried to start the car still slow crank no start. Says I have a starter problem and will diagnose AC once the car runs. Given the issues and mileage and my wife's ""complaining"" or more like worried about it breaking down I decided to donate it. Tow driver comes. Puts jumper on the battery and it starts right up. Had him turn on AC and no scraping noise (but not sure if it was blowing cold air or not). Asked him to take the jumper off and then start the car and it started right up again. I am surprised. The only thing I did was change the relays for the AC in anticipation that could be an issue prior to the car not starting. I also tested the battery and Autozone said it was fine. In theory the car should have started for me it seems?  What happened here. Did that jumper shock it back to life? "

What’s causing this rough start?
This is a Renault Clio 2014 1.5 dci. I’m not sure how obvious it is in the video but only on cold starts, the car shakes and the revs quite low drop for a few seconds then jump back up before idling normally, usually this is as rough as it gets except for when it drops below quarter of a tank of fuel where it stalled once whilst starting. The car is always started in neutral with the clutch all the way in so I don’t think it’s a slipping clutch causing it and the problem only becomes more noticeable with how low fuel the fuel is. Though I’m not sure if it’s a fuel quality issue since I only use standard Shell diesel."

Need help
So I am at my wits end. 
My 2000 Acura integra with 231k miles on it is shifting strange. It’s an automatic and has run amazing up until this point. 
So while accelerating the rpms will bounce in between 1-2rpms at like 20-40mph. 
Then while at a speed I want to maintain the car seems to lurch and the rpms will rise or sometimes fall and it makes a deep sound. 

I have so far checked compression, all four cylinders are good, I have checked spark, and replaced my dizzy cap and rotor, and spark plugs. (Need to replace wires but I’m not sure that’s the issue checked those as well)
I have checked fuel, and the fuel pump and filter have been replaced as well as I’ve run Techron through to clean the injectors. 
I have also checked air, but have not replaced the map sensor.
I’ve replaced the throttle position sensor. 

I’m not sure what else it could possibly be, other than maybe the ecu? 
This video somewhat shows the fluctuation in rpms. I’m just so confused and have honestly not run into this before. Any opinions and options would be appreciated💕"

1991 accord sudden no start
i picked up my 91 accord a little over a week ago and drove it fine for about 3 days, parked at my girlfriends house and came out to leave the next day, boom no start. it cranks and cranks but no start, we tried everything to fix it for about 3 days and one day it just started. no idea why, we tried replacing things and they made no difference, so we put all the original stuff back in, original fuel pump still in, original injectors, original wiring, original relay (all things we attempted to replace but they made no difference) our instinct was the fuel system because when this happened my fuel pump made no noise at all (checked all relays fuses etc even replaced the whole thing) and we even tested the fuel pump out side of the car and it works fine. so after it spontaneously started i drove it like this for another 3 - 4 days, starting up everytime, and parked at my house, came outside to leave the next day, same issue. so by this point im thinking its a fuel filter because sometimes it starts, sometimes it won’t. in my mind, the fuel filter holds sediment and if it runs with that sediment in it, it can begin clogging it, get stuck for a couple days, clear up, and run fine again. but after changing it the new one leaked, i’ve fixed the leak today but still no start, any ideas on this?"

How to express urgency on a job without nagging?
Just curious from any fellow mechanics. I bought an old 81 fiat spider about a month ago and first 5 minutes had an issue, which turned out to be the clutch cable. Diagnosed fairly quickly, however the mechanic has been ultra slow to get to working on it. It took like a week or two just to diagnose, then he ordered the part which took a week, and on Monday he said it arrived so he can start working on it soon. I followed up end of day Wednesday and he says he hasn’t started yet cuz it was his bday… it’s been sitting in the same spot for almost a month at the mechanic for a clutch cable replacement. I’ve talked with the guy and he was super cool and seemed excited to work on it. I’m just hoping he keeps his word and can try working on it this week. 

Is there any way to express urgency without being a nag? I just feel like for what this job is, it’s taken forever.  But I don’t wanna get on his bad side by poking him too much. It’s just I bought this car as a fun summer ride and am anxious to drive it, especially being in the Midwest with long winters

Engine whistle/whine
I have a 2024 Hyundai Tucson that after being driven for an hour+ will start to whine/whistle when accelerating.  Also when coming to a complete stop the engine will turn off using the ""auto off"" feature and when the vehicle turns back on it will whine/whistle for a few seconds.  The vehicle was purchased brand new and now has 9k miles on it and this issue just started happening recently.

I took it to the dealership and they said it is a normal sound and they decided it was coming from the throttle body and electric oil pump and I shouldn't be concerned.

I have never heard any other vehicles make this noise before and a quick Google search tells me that this noise is not normal. 

Please let me know if this is indeed normal or if I should take it to another shop for inspection.

Steering Wheel Shake when Braking but only occasionally.
Hi Everyone,

Wondering if maybe 2 issues I am having are related.  I have a 2011 Corolla with 125K on the clock.  I had both front wheel bearings replaced 2 months ago.  The buzzing I wa hearing was no longer there.  However, it was replaced by a noticeable pulsing/thumping noise when driving over 45mph.  

Brought it back to the shop, no suspension issues found.  

Recently I have noticed a steering wheel shake when braking heavy from speed.  The thumping/pulsing noise also dissappears when lightly braking or turning.

I was initially thinking something in the suspension, but could it possibly be a brake issue?  The tyres are fairly new and the pads are also pretty new.

Any suggestions would be appreciated!"

Hi everyone,

I have an issue with my car, it is AUDI A4 2018. Allroad Quattro. When I turn on heating, it starts to blow for few seconds and then stops. You can hear ""blowing"" noise from dashboard but nothing comes out. After that I tried to set temp to 21,5 celsius it starts to blow again, as soon as I put higher temp for 0,5 or 1 deegress celsius, it stops again. Even if I set ""HI"" it is not working, just noise from dashboard. I want to mention that temp outside is 21-22 C. There is one more thing, when I press recirculation button, it works perfectly on any temp I set.  Car is made for Canadian market, if that has any sense. What can be the problem?

Hissing at AC expansion valve after repair?
08 Hyundai Sonata 2.4L engine, 8th digit of vin is C.

AC started intermittently blowing hot around a month ago, then stopped completely two weeks ago. I traced the issue to the clutch on the compressor, as the signal wire was sending the correct voltage and the clutch would not engage when jumped. Had a shop evac the system so I could swap the parts myself. Everything that was replaced:

Compressor (prefilled with oil)
Condenser
Dryer element (came with condenser)
Expansion valve
All o-rings (lubed with PAG oil)
Shrader valves on both high and low ports
Cabin air filter
 
After everything was back together, I pulled a vacuum for 45 minutes then sealed the system. No change in pressure after 2 hours of it sitting, so I determined the system was sealed correctly and I could recharge. Connected the first can of r-134a to the manifold line, bled it so no air was in, and began filling the system. The clutch on the compressor engaged when pressure at the low port reached around 40psi, and the high side pressure began rising, as expected. I continued to add refrigerant, but not letting the low side pressure go above 55psi. High side pressure reached 270psi and kept climbing, but the air was still hot. I shut the car off after the high side pressure kept climbing over 300psi. Ambient temperature was around 85F at the time with roughly 55% humidity. Resting pressure in the system was around 79psi this morning. The only symptom I can identify is a hissing sound coming from the dashboard that I traced to the expansion valve, which only occurs when the car is running, and the AC is on. I don’t know how there could be a leak at the valve since the system was tested and held a vacuum for hours? I don’t really know what next to look at, and I really don’t want to take it in and pay for another evac if possible. And I REALLY don’t want to replace the evaporator in the dashboard… Anyone have any ideas?!?"

2010 Suzuki swift.
So the car has done around 80k miles, however I’m having a little problem clutch wise. So every now and then the car dosent go into 1st gear, or you have to yank it in 1st to get it into. When going in reverse sometimes it dosent and makes a grinding noise. I’ve noticed myself that the brake fluid reservoir is slowly going down indicating a leak. Now If I’m not mistaken the brake fluid also is for the transmission/clutch fluid or whatever, which explains why my brake light sensor comes on sometimes when it’s low. So obviously there is a leak somewhere in the system, does the issue correlate to the clutch not engaging properly, and when stationary with gear 1 in the car rumbles, then when disengage the clutch into neutral then back into 1st it stops. Sorry for the long worded block, I also don’t have much experience with mechanical side of things. Any suggestions would be much appreciated the cars going in for its MOT soon anyway so I’ll let them know. Cheers people."

Both boots on newly installed cv joints came off - Grease expelled.
Mechanic replaced both cv joints, I believe almost immediately the boots came off because I could hear a faint click as accelerator engaged and disengaged. This gradually got worse. When I first noticed it early I took the car back and mechanic did a rudimentary check to hear the noise as I demonstrated and asked me to book it back in at my convenience. 2 week later, yesterday I got my tyres changed and while the car was on the ramp i found that both boots and clips were undone and hanging off with grease all over arms and drop links. I've probably done near 1000 miles on dry joints.

Will a regrease and new boots fix the issue (bare in mind the click noise as I press and release gas pedal) or do the joints need replacing.

How do both boots fall off though?

Joints were GKN Lobro."

Code: P2714 - Toyota RAV4 - 2010 - 4CYL 2.5
Hello all,

I'm reaching out to see if anyone has experience or insight regarding an issue I’m having with my Toyota RAV4 (automatic transmission, \~79,000 miles).

Recently, the check engine light came on. I pulled the code and got **P2714 – Pressure Control Solenoid D**, which indicates the solenoid may be stuck in the off position or not functioning properly.

The car drove fine afterward, no noticeable issues during the 5-mile trip home. Out of caution, I took it to a highly rated transmission shop. They cleared the code, performed extensive factory diagnostics, and drove it for over 150 miles, but the code didn’t return. They then dropped the transmission pan for a visual inspection. Everything looked normal, some faint “glittery” metal particles in the fluid, but nothing alarming. The shop mentioned the fluid may have never been changed, and no need for alarm. I did pay for new fluid however.

They also found a loose engine mount near the solenoid plug, which they tightened. They suspected it may have disturbed a connection and triggered the light. Based on their inspection, they didn’t recommend replacing the solenoid at that time.

I picked up the vehicle and it ran great. I put about 100–125 miles on it before the check engine light came back. I called them again, and they suggested clearing the code and monitoring how long it took to return. After clearing it, I got another 70–100 miles before the light reappeared. This time, they mentioned it’s likely an **electrical issue**, since the code didn’t return immediately.

After further discussion, I suggested replacing **Solenoid D**, reasoning that it might be sticking briefly, just enough to trigger the code intermittently. They agreed that’s a reasonable next step (and I’m kicking myself for not doing it when the pan was already off).

The estimate for the solenoid replacement is **$1,040**. $200 for the part + 850 labor. Understandably, I’m hesitant to drop that amount of money on a maybe. This is a well-maintained Toyota, and I’ve owned Toyotas my entire life without ever running into wiring issues. I know things can happen, but electrical problems on Toyotas seem rare.

To recap:

* **No shifting issues**
* **Code P2714 (Pressure Control Solenoid D)**
* **Code cleared twice, took 70–125 miles to reappear**
* **Transmission shop found no mechanical faults**
* **Possible intermittent solenoid or electrical connection issue**

If anyone has experience with this code or issue, or thoughts on whether it's worth replacing the solenoid, I'd really appreciate the input."

Starting problems with my 2004 Camry LE
Hey guys so I have been having a weird issue with my 04 Camry. It started out last week with my car not starting in the morning, no big deal charged it, seemed fine for a few days. 

Then when I was at work I went to go to lunch and the car wouldn't start. I jumped it with a portable jumper and it seemed fine. I figured the battery was cooked and I made plans to get a new battery. 

So last night I go get the new battery, car starts right up I think I'm in the clear. I drive home. 

Then this morning I go out, go to start the car and nothing. No lights, no dinging with the key in. I grab my big charger unhook the battery from the car and hook it directly to the battery to see the level, and it's full! Then I hook the terminals back up and I hear the car dinging cuz the key is in the ignition. 

I can't keep living like this. Any recommendations?

If I am packed faing down on a slope it happens more. There are no engine comes, and no apparent drain of the battery. I took it into a mechanic. They checked the draw on the battery from the starter. Checked the battery connections but could not find any issues, and obviously the issue did not occur when they tested. When it does start there is no issues shifting into geared from the transmittion



So I am looking for advice of what to look at next. To my knowlwdge they did not check the starter physically at all. ​​"

1999 Camry New Alternator Overcharging
Just replaced a dead alternator on my Camry. I managed to get the car home as it was broken down in a random spot in town. It was a new remanufactured unit, the install went very smoothly (literally 3 bolts and 2 plugs cant mess it up), so I thought. Anyways I get home and the alternator is having regulator issues as tested via multimeter. Parameters are fine at idle even under load, but as soon as the RPMs exceed 2000 the voltage goes off the charts (16-17v +). 

I do recall from initial install that the regulator plug was difficult to pull out of the old one, felt jammed, there was also no click (from the clip) as the video said there would be. When I plugged it into the new alternator, there was no click either but believe me I pushed it in there solidly. 

Im looking at the plug now and it appears that theres some damage to the surface, I cant see the conductive material too well or see if theres any damage inside. I assume it was this way when it was plugged into the old alternator for 26 years but cant say for certain. Could this plug be the reason for the overcharging issue or is it likely something else (ie bad unit, resistance somewhere, bad grounds)"

Steering issues after installing BDS lift kit on F350
Just finished the front end on a BDS leveling kit on my 2024 F350. iI was a suspension lift (new springs and shocks) with new radius arms, sway bar drop brackets, and a new adjustable track bar. Test drive was all of 100 ft, steering felt absolutely horrible, sloppy, and the steering wheel seemed to follow the road way too much (pointing all the way to passenger side on a road which very slightly curved left, but would be straight when pulling back into driveway).

I had had issues getting the track bar into the factory bracket at the frame mounting bracket, as it was too wide to fit. The bushings/sleeve were out of spec as I had to sand them down just to press them in, so rather than grind the mount down I opted to sand the faces of the bushings down to get it to fit, but it was still tight enough to have to bash it in with a hammer. After calling BDS, at a minimum my track bar is 2/10ths of an inch too wide, but the tech was unable to tell me if the spec measured the width with or without the bushings installed, so it could be even more out of spec.

Axle seems centered and front end is level, adjusting drag links helped with the steering wheel a bit, but the root cause seems to be something else. When the truck is on and in park, turning the wheel causes the entire front end to shift slightly and tilt towards the side being steered to. Can binding at the track bar frame mounting bracket cause this, or is it likely something else? Maybe the track bar isnt adjusted to the right length even though axle seems more or less centered? What is the best method for determining axle position (where should I measure from on the frame)? I plan on getting bds to send a new track bar, but would like to try and get this drivable to make sure its the track bar causing all these issues."

2011 Civic A/C electrical trouble
I've got a 2011 Civic that has had long-running A/C issues. Compressor would intermittently refuse to switch on for the last few years. I've taken it to several mechanics over the years and it's never been solved for more than two or three years.

This time, I went ahead and educated myself. I tried swapping the relays, which seems to be the most common issue with this generation of Civic. No dice. I checked all the fuses, all good, the freon, full, as well as the head unit. While checking for voltage with a simple circuit tester, I grounded the leftmost wire on the power cluster going to the compressor (as I understand it, this is the reference wire). The compressor immediately came on and cooled in seconds. This made me think the problem might be the low pressure switch. Rather than replacing it, I did something a little naughty and bypassed it with a paperclip. The car started, but the compressor didn't come on. Went ahead and put everything back where it belonged.

At that point, I felt like I was out of ideas. Took it to the local mechanic who says they did electrical work on Hondas. They charged me $150 to check the freon before they were willing to look at anything else. Then they called and said I needed a new compressor. Here's the full notes I got (screenshot above): 

""The AC relay is not grounded properly, which would cause the compressor to kick on. The relay is told to ground from the thermal protector (high pressure switch) on the compressor. There is an open circuit on the thermal protector when it should be closed. Forced ground through the reference wire and the compressor came on. Needs a compressor.""

My question is: why do I need a whole new $1k+ compressor? Surely there's some other way to ground that wire properly, right?"

Master cylinder failed twice
2013 Mazda 3.

I noticed the brakes losing pressure and took the car to an auto shop. They told me it was due to a master cylinder failure and charged me
$500 to fix it. 

4 weeks later. The brakes lost pressure while I was driving- same exact problem as before. I checked the brake fluid and it was empty so I refilled it, but the brakes still had little pressure. I took it back to the same auto shop and they fixed it again, for free.

2 weeks later. I'm driving in stop and go traffic downtown when the brakes lose pressure AGAIN. I also notice a leak from the left front wheel well. 
Haven't checked the brake fluid cause I got home after dark. 

I'm overwhelmed. I don't want to take it back to the same shop, because I don't trust them. I don't feel I was treated respectfully or fairly.  I also did not appreciate the way they communicated with me. I still don't really understand the problem after the first fix.

Any advice on how to handle this- clearly need a second opinion. Should I contact the first shop? "

Diodes are fine and voltage regulation also passed, but not enough current. I’m thinking it’s a wire harness issue but I’m wondering if there’s any other things I should look at or take in mind?

Bad Alternator or Starter? 2012 Honda Civic 1.8L Intermittent Starting Issues

Both of these videos are what's happening in my case, but it doesn't happen every time I try to start the car. It seems like usually the car just starts first try if the previous trip was a long distance; and it takes a few tries  to start if I drove a short distance.  
  
  
 I've been having this problem for a few months it just ended up leaving me stranded today when it refused to start after like 10 tries. I got my gf to drive me to Autozone and back and I installed a new battery, and got the car to start. But then I drove back to Autozone to return the old battery and it took 3 tries to start the car again after that. So I drove around on the highway for a bit to see if that would charge the battery up and came back to autozone. I had them run the battery/starter/alternator test and the car started first try for that test twice. But it failed the ""charging system"" (alternator?) test both times. 

I saw comments on the youtube video and the reddit post I took the second video from that said it's a starter problem, so I'm not sure if I should replace the alternator or the starter...

New A/C Compressor Whine
Hi all,

I just replaced my A/C compressor, expansion valve and condenser. This is my 3rd A/C rebuild and I’m a little dumbfounded. This is the first time I’ve come across this problem. Before describing the situation—the new A/C is blowing cold and works great!

The new compressor is making a strong whine when the clutch engages. In the video, I revved the engine to 3k rpm with and without the A/C turned on. It sounds similar to a bad alternator. During the rebuild, the system was flushed and refilled to the OE recommended oil capacity spread throughout the system (I didn’t dump it all in the compressor). It held vacuum for 12 hrs (all new gaskets) and after the first freon charge, the noise started.

I thought I might’ve pulled a bad vacuum and (with the excess moisture) the system was overcharged. I immediately kept the A/C shut off and got it professionally evacuated and recharged. After picking up the car, the noise continued. Any idea what could’ve caused this issue? All parts are from a GPD kit purchased from rock auto. 

Ultimately: I need help figuring out what to do next. Is this a relatively normal hum or should I try installing a new compressor/clutch? Any advice is appreciated, thanks!"

2017 Toyota Sienna with Electrical Gremlins, Battery Charging issues
Hello everyone,

I am having trouble diagnosing my 2017 Sienna's electrical issues. I have just replaced the battery and alternator of this car, but after 3 months, these problems are coming back. The car seems to have a brief (1/2 second) struggle when adding loads on the electrical system, and all of a sudden my car is becoming harder and harder to start. It appears that the alternator is not charging the battery as well. Here is what I know:

Symptoms:

* Recently Hard Starting, 
* Cold battery voltage is 12-12.1 volts
* With the car running, voltage slowly climbs to 12.4 volts peak
* Lights/accessories dim for 1/2 second when I add a load
   * Such as turning the steering wheel, turn signals, or high beams.

What puzzles me is below:

* Cigarette lighter port reads 13.2-13.5 volts
* No battery light
* Alternator seems to provide enough power to keep the vehicle driving

Does this mean that the alternator is fine? I am confused at what this could mean, and what possible issues could it be?

2017 Camry Electrical Issue
Hi All:

The weirdness in my 2017 Camry (79k miles) continues. I made a post a few months back describing an issue with the check charging system warning. After further testing and mechanic visits, the warning stopped appearing. My new battery and alternator test fine today. 

I’m now getting weird issues with the TPMS and vehicle MPG estimates. 

What could cause the TPMS to flash repeatedly/lose readings after roughly 30 minutes of interstate driving, and then go away completely/get readings back once slowed/on local roads?

Case in point: Last night, about 30mins into a 90min drive, the TPMS started blinking repeatedly, lost all readings, and then stayed on. When I exited the interstate and stopped at a light, the now solid light went away. About 2-3mins afterwards all TPMS readings came back, and were normal (38-ish). This does not happen in 30mins of driving around in town/city traffic. 

In addition, while I realize vehicle mpg estimates aren’t fully accurate, I’ve consistently pulled 28-31mpg. Now, no matter what type of driving, it’s 22-24mpg despite regular service (including fuel system). 

Is it possible for a single electrical issue to cause all of these problems? Check charging system, TPMS, poor MPG estimates? 

Any thoughts and suggestions are appreciated. "

Pretty sure my car needs a bloody exorcism. Really need some help here!!
Okay people I'm going to need some assistance on this one. I have a 2012 Chrysler 200 2.4 l. So my problem started with car going into limp mode every so often like once every couple days and my speedometer and all the cluster like the cluster start going wonky like fluctuating and acting erratic for a few seconds then it would go away and everything was fine that was happening for about a week maybe only about two times a day nothing I couldn't handle I bypassed the limp mode type of thing and my throttle position sensor light comes off and then everything was fine. Then then when I was doing these things my car was actually shutting down like dying like throttle position sensor would come on I would go live mode and then I would just have to like post off of the highway or something and I would wait and then it would start back up again and then I'd happen again and then when I tried starting it it just wouldn't turn on anymore so I figured possibly even my alternator or battery because when I tested my battery and charge the battery thinking that it was just drained or something when I fully charged it my car wouldn't turn over so I'm like okay it's the alternator so I changed it . when I brought it into the shop ultimately they said I also needed to change the battery which is retarded cuz I tested the battery but I did it anyways . Got the car back worked for about a day and then all of a sudden all of my gauges while I was driving on the highway started going erratic like every speedometer if I cluster was going up and down up and down and my car would inevitably shut off completely lose power and then it would turn back on again all in a matter of 20 seconds and this is after I just dropped $1,000 on my vehicle. I just assumed that it was maybe a faulty battery connection the mechanic just didn't tighten it properly the connectors so I tried tightening the connectors and it still wouldn't turn over so I figured that possibly I fried my alternator again due to high voltage of my battery Maybe you know at this point I'm wondering if it's like a fuse issue a wiring issue or at everything issue LOL so I replaced the alternator again in a matter of 2 weeks and then I get it back from shop and it works and then it did the same thing again about a day later againnnnn!!!! I'm literally losing my mind at this point, so from there I literally just took my battery out wire brushed all the connections really good reset it by like putting the negative and positive terminal together for like I don't know a couple hours reset my throttle position sensor thing cuz that was flashing by doing like the foot pedal thing to retrain it I reset everything I checked out the fuses everything seems like everything was good to go I turn it on and it worked and the exact same thing happened again so this time I said after two mechanics two alternators nobody could figure out what was wrong with my car so I literally said this is a wiring issue clearly so I took it upon myself to rip out every goddamn wiring harness in my car including the TIPM  right out of my car as well as thoroughly inspected every single wire under my hood and found a frayed light blue wire which according to my knowledge was the battery feed wire so I taped it up with electrical tape fixed it and lo and behold I turned my car on and everything seems to be working fine and it's been working fine for about three or four months no problems at all since I fixed so here I am thinking it's all good baffled that I paid for two mechanics who did nothing my car and I ended up fixing myself I think that's an alarming issue in itself. That aside, so today my car just randomly goes into limp mode again randomly  months later except it's not the same as before its  different this time it's like it won't actually let me go over 20 km so I'm like okay cuz before when I was flashing like the throttle position sensor then I would like go away as I was driving and it was like off and on but it never actually cut my speed down so that I couldn't drive over a certain speed. Figured maybe mass air flow sensor so I cleaned that still going to work with dry for about 30 seconds going to limp mode put me down to 20 km jolting really erratic Behavior thought maybe it was transmission fluid my level's word not showing that it was dry thank God but now I'm stumped so I checked my fuses I check all the other what I believe is the connectors for sensors around the throttle body I cleaned the throttle body I clean my air filter still not working properly. So I went and I got some transmission fix Lucas transmission fix is what it's called and since I put that in my car is still doing limp mode and except now I feel like my power steering is almost gone it just really erratic I mean when I turn it feels like my car is going to go off the road I don't know if that is anything to do with it if it's just coincidental but it feels like my vehicle is like the throttle is definitely not right I feel like there's an air flow clearly an airflow issue everything seems sketchy I don't know what to do I believe it's obviously some kind of wiring problem or sensor problem or could it be something bigger any ideas it seems full I took my mass air flow sensor cleaner and I clean the mass air flow sensor I have cleaned the throttle body I have checked the wires I truly don't know  which is called Lucas transmission fix and since then I feel like I'm losing power steering which is crazy because I have power steering fluid and my car  feels really sketchy felt like my brakes were foing to are going to fail at one point but they didenr thank god. my throttle seems messed up I can feel it's in my foot and when I press on the gas it just feels like heavy now like it just feels like heavy I don't know I can't explain I feel like I made it worse but  I put an OBD scanner to it all the codes that were there before are all gone now since I did all these little things to it to try to get it back to up the par the only thing it's sitting on the scanner is low pressure wheel sensor and my engine check engine light is on but I don't know what they could be because nothing else is coming up on the scanner. Any ideas? Is it something bigger then I'm trying to diagnose here? "

2008 Jeep Liberty died whilst driving
I was driving my car when the steering wheel seized up, and engine just shut off. Lifted the hood to see it was smoking. Had it towed to my house and checked to see what the problem could be. Thought it was the water pump and temperature sensor from what the Check engine code told my reader. Replaced pump and sensor. Went to turn the car on and it didn't start. Electronics worked and it SEEMED like the fuses were clicking but the damn thing wouldn't turn over. Tested the battery and it still had a 12 Amp charge. THEN I thought I could have a bad ignition switch. Replaced THAT. SAME GODDAMN THING. I'm at my wits end. Could anybody tell me what MIGHT be going on here?"

2021 SQ5 with 46K miles with a ""turbo underboost"" CEL (P0299) - could someone point me in the right direction to what I should attempt first?
First time owning german/AUDI. Bought the car in October. Now roughly 46K miles. Apparently no longer under warranty.



Code popped on this morning. I'll reset it after work with my OBDII and see if it remains off. From all the research I've found, this could be so many different problems, from simple (air filter, MAP sensor) to complex (wastegate loose, waterpump leaking into vacuum lines, or bad/dirty diverter valve) to expensive (turbo faulty needs replacement).



I do not notice a difference in driving at all.  There is no apparent loss in boost from what I can, and acceleration feels normal without delay. I recently have been putting the car in dynamic mode, and noticed since, that when letting go of the throttle, I feel an aggressive downshift from the transmission, but according to google, this is normal in sports mode. But then again symptoms of a bad diverter valve are apparently the same symptoms (?). 



I'm going to first try changing the air filter in the engine bay but I don't know if that'll really affect anything. What other steps should I take to approach this?



  
Audi and other german shops near me will charge $250 just to diagnose the problem. I would like to try and fix this myself without throwing endless money away. I have down my own oil, brakes, etc. so I have some skills but  this seems like it could get very complicated pretty fast.



  
Any advice would be greatly appreciated, I feel like I'm losing my mind thinking about the worst case scenario ie new turbo. :("

Nissan Juke battery light coming on despite new alternator and battery
My car (2017 Juke) started intermittently showing the battery light while I was driving a few days ago, and having googled it suggested there was a problem with the alternator, so I called AA (who replaced my alternator 6 months ago during a breakdown callout, so it was still under warranty). They came and replaced it, and checked the battery, connections, and belts, said all was fine.

The light continued to come back the next day, so I called them again - someone came out, checked everything plus the starter motor again, then did full diagnostics, and said he couldn't find an issue (his words were 'it's a perfectly healthy car') but that maybe the battery was getting old (I've never replaced it in the 4 years I've owned the car, so entirely possible, as I don't know if it would have been replaced before that). He also suggested getting a USB charger for the cigarette lighter port that showed battery voltage, because then I could see whether the voltage was actually dropping while I was driving/when the light came on - his thinking was that it was an issue with the sensor/the electrics somewhere and that the alternator and battery themselves were fine.

Got the battery replaced today just in case, once again a different mechanic checked the connections, checked the alternator, etc, all seemed fine. Set off driving - battery light still coming on intermittently, and the voltage indicator is showing that it ranges between 12.1 and 14.6 while driving, but mostly between 12.1 and 13.6 with brief jumps up to 14.6. These fluctuations don't correlate at all with the periods the battery light is on - i.e., the light comes on and the voltage can be at 14.6 suggesting it's charging, but can be off when the voltage is at 12.1 suggesting it's not. (Admittedly I have no idea how accurate these volt indicators are, plus I saw something online about the Nissan smart charging being a bit different to other cars - so not sure if this is a factor!).

I have a 200 mile journey to make tomorrow, and a fair few other miles to drive over the weekend before a 200 mile journey back on Sunday. Given that multiple mechanics have checked the alternator, starter motor, and connections, plus it's got a new battery - can I drive it? And any ideas what might be going wrong?

(I posted this in the Nissan sub too, but realised here might be a better place)"

Charging one a/c system from another.
So, I have 2 cars that are running r134a refrigerant. The 1st one is fully charged with a clean system, but it needs to be discharged for repair. The 2nd one is being worked on and its going to need to be charged soon. Rather than using fresh new r134a to charge it with, I'd like to pull the r134a out of the 1st cars system and add it to the 2nd car.

The only problem I think I may have with this plan, is that the 1st car takes pag150 and the 2nd car takes pag46. And I wouldn't know how much of the pag150 got pulled out with the refrigerant.

Is there any way to minimize the amount of oil extraction enough for it not to matter? Or any other way around this problem?"

I got my tranny rebuilt and now it won't downshift for passing speeds
I have a 2014 Dodge Charger AWD Plus. It has a 3.6L 8-speed engine. The engine was previously worked on by a guy who didn't know what he was doing and messed up my granny.

Took it to AAMCO and they rebuilt it at a cost of $8k (I know; they weren't very honest about how much it would cost until after the work was done). Anyway, after about a month, when I push it to passing speeds, the tranny doesn't down shift and the car just slows down until I gently push the gas. Good lord, how frustrating and particularly dangerous. 

I take it back and they refreshed the many computers and it's still doesn't work. He said some kind of paper us having one thing read the engine as cold and another reads as hot, like over 400°. He said it MIGHT work but wants to charge an extra $500. I'm ready to take it to a stealership to see what the real problem is because I really can't afford to play whack-a-mole.

Any ideas?"

2019 Honda Cr-v brake stopped working. Where should I take it to?
My girlfriend's 2019 Honda Cr-v (EX trim) (120k miles) experienced braking issues twice in the past couple of months. I was not in the car either times, but according to her, she pressed the brake paddle, it didn't slow down, and braking hard didn't make a difference. After she took her foot off and pressed the brake again, it worked. At first, I thought it was the road condition, but it happened twice already and she almost hit other cars and in order to avoid collision, she had to go over the curb. 

I see this as a serious problem and obviously this needs to be looked into. Does anybody have a good guess on what is wrong with her car? And where should I take her car to? Local mechanic or dealer ship?  
(She had all four brake pads and rotors changed two months ago, but brake issue happened once before the pads and rotor change and happened once more after the change)

Her car is bought used from a Honda dealership that is not local. Is it good idea to take it to a different dealership? Do they charge to look at the car? How much does it typically cost to fix problems like this?

Thank you."

OLD CAR NOT IDLING/STARTING
1980 LINCOLN CONTINENTAL MARK VI
This might be a bit long because this has been a journey, this sub is my last resort

current problem with my car is that it will stall at low speeds or stops if I am not giving it gas, took it in for a diagnosis and they said the idle air control valve was leaky so I had to get another one, installed it myself, and it seems to be functioning fine, however, the car still won't idle. I turned the idle screw all the way up and messed with that a good amount, and I usually have to kind of pump the gas a little bit for it to turn on on a cold engine, yesterday when it died, it stopped turning over, left it overnight and came back to charge the battery and it turned over and started after a couple tries. When it stalls an ""oil pressure"" and ""charge system"" warnings pop up. The following things have been checked/replaced since I got the car.

new spark plugs
new alternator
new battery
oil and filter change
starter has been checked
new idle air control valve

I have had the car about a month, selling it is not an option as it carries heavy sentimental value and is DOPE ASF, had one owner for the last 40 years before me and was stored in a garage in texas.
123000 miles

Car sometimes doesn’t charge under load
I have an older Mercedes 1988 260e

My car will sometimes not charge properly when under load. The abs light will turn on (which indicates I’m getting low voltage according to the owners manual) and the car will run rough

However, I’ve replaced the alternator, the voltage regulator, the brushes, the battery, everything. It still won’t go away. I’ve also had the grounds checked.

Worst thing is that it’s intermittent. I can’t pin down an exact cause. Sometimes it’s only minor, sometimes my car will straight up not want to keep running. Seems to also be worse while at idle, and is worse with more electronics on.

Recently it’s been alright. I’ve been able to use the car properly, but I tried using everything, like wipers, headlights, seat heaters, and it started giving me problems again

No idea how to pin this down. The shop I brought it to tried replacing the battery and alternator again, but it didn’t change anything. Eventually they gave up and gave it back to me.

EDIT: I should mention that I actually had the alternator replace the week after I bought my car, as it seemingly failed randomly. I started encountering these load problems about a year after the alternator was replaced. The shop tried replacing the alternator under warranty again, but it didn’t stop the problem, so they put the original alternator back in.

Any advice on where to go from here?"

2019 Jeep Cherokee having consistent starting problems?
I have a 2019 Jeep Cherokee trailhawk 4x4 2.4l v6 that has had consistent starting issues. It does not happen every time or even every other time. But it’ll handle fine and then not start. It’s stranded me at gas pumps and shopping centers, and once it even died while in gear at a stop sign. 

The issue started back at the end of August/early September of last year. We thought it was the battery because when it does this it says the battery voltage is extremely low. The battery was checked and found to be half charged, but was replaced (as it was under warranty). It still had the issue. 

It was later involved in a minor wreck on the passenger side (I can discuss damages of that in comments if requested) in late November and taken to a shop in December. When I took it in I asked them to look into the engine start issues and they wrote a note on my window, but nothing came of it. I got it back in February, it died while I was trying to return the rental car. I took it to a different mechanic. The other mechanic diagnosed it with a PTU failure that’s currently under open recall. It was fixed at a dealership (by replacing the PTU with a new part, same piece, as a temp fix as there’s currently no solutions from Jeep) 

It died again and I took it back to the dealership where they said it showed no codes for the failure, and they couldn’t duplicate it. I insisted they keep trying to drive it, and they had a tech take it as far as 200 miles round trip and it didn’t die. It did however throw a check engine light. 

The check engine light was for the code p06de. I declined their services, took it home and checked the dip stick. The oil was overfilled (unsure of if it was from me changing my oil back in August or not and I’m not assigning blame, but when we’ve checked the stick in the past it’s always been at a normal level) so we changed the oil completely last night. Nothing appeared wrong with the oil, however there were a few black specks in the filter. We determined it wasn’t metal by pressing it into our skin, and because it wasn’t in the pan we think it was contaminated when removing the filter. 

We turned the check engine light off with a code reader and waited for the check engine light to come back on and it hadn’t yet, but it died again. 

That’s where this video is from. I apologize for the talking, but I chose this video because it shows something that it’s done twice now. It originally started. Everything came on. The engine felt like it flipped over. I was able to put it in drive, but then it didn’t go. The engine turned itself off. Then in the video you can hear it do what it normally does where it tries to start and fails. 

I’m really at a loss of what to do. We’ve been looking into videos of things that could be wrong with it looking and looking for a place to start. We watched a YouTube video of a vehicle with the same problem and in the video the mechanic decided to replace the engine control module. I guess I’m looking for advice on whether that would be a good place to start or not."

P0137 is it an electrical issue?
2008 Subaru Outback base wagon with 208k miles

Hi all. Here’s a little background. I have had this car for over 10 years now. I’ve had the same check engine code for like 6-7 years now, and multiple mechanics haven’t been able to solve the problem. 

Originally when it came in, my mechanic said that it was the o2 sensor, common recommendation for this code, so we tried replacing both sensors.  Did not solve the issues.  He then thought maybe an exhaust leak, didn’t really do anything either.  Not sure what he did with the exhaust leak.  After all that I just felt like he had no idea how to solve it and was just charging me for moneys sake

 Fast forward a few years and I wanted to try and solve the code myself. I decided to buy OEM sensors and install them myself. Drove the car for a little after clearing codes and it came back like it always does. I checked the exhaust for leaks by spraying some soapy water on the exhaust, it bubbled up a little bit in a few spots.  Some around where the cat mates to the exhaust manifold, on a flange, and further down towards the end.  I’ve never smelled any exhaust and it never sounded like there was a serious exhaust leak. So, I took videos and posted here awhile back, most said it wasn’t enough to be concerned about. 

I bought a manual for this model Subaru and wanted to go through the step by step for the P0137. I’m terrible at reading electrical diagrams and got swamped with work, so I took it to a different shop that advertised a “master Subaru mechanic on site”. I took it to them, told them I had just changed the o2 sensors not too long ago, knowing that be the first thing they’d recommend, and specifically told them to please do a continuity and voltage test through the harness and ECM. Well, they call me back and tell me I need new o2 sensors because they were reading bad. I asked them how they knew that, and they said because the scanner was telling them they’re bad. I told them that I had just changed them not that long ago, but they insisted that it was bad o2 sensors and sometimes OEM’s come bad from the factory. I don’t believe them. 

I took it for a test drive the other day after clearing codes and hooked up my scanner tool to read the voltage of the o2 sensor. The step-by-step says to warm the engine up and hold the car at 3,000 rpm for approx 2 minutes.  When I took it driving the voltage never got close to .490V, UNLESS I would drive and get the car to 3,000 rpm. As soon as it dropped below 3,000rpm the volts immediately dropped off.

So my question is, is this an indicator of the o2 sensors being bad, or something totally different. 

I’ve attached the step by step, and a pic of my scanner when I was driving. The jumps in volts in the pics correspond to when the cars rpm would hit around 3,000 rpm and the drops correspond to it dropping below that. 

Thanks for any help.

Need help diagnosing if i have a bad starter or alternator
2006 mazda 6 GY wagon (4 cylinder auto)

My car occasionally won't start. I'm not sure if my problem is with the alternator or starter motor, and would appreciate help in diagnosing the issue before spending money on parts I may not need.

The battery is a year old, so if it has an issue, that'd be a symptom of the alternator. Battery terminals and connectors are clean.

I'll get a click from the starter relay, but no crank. If I wait a bit, sometimes it'll crank on the next try. Alternatively, I can roll it in neutral, pop it in drive and roll it 30cm or so, put it back in park, and usually it'll then crank and start. Not sure if this is placebo, or actually doing anything given its an automatic.

I had the issue last year, and the problem went away after putting in a new battery.

This year, it's come back, and happens even after putting the battery on trickle charge overnight, or when trying to use jumper leads with a friend's car. I'm yet to try with a jumper pack.

I don't have a multimeter, but yesterday when i had the issue again, the tricklecharger was showing 12.6v when first connected to the battery. This morning, the tricklecharger was saying 'full' and I had the non-start issue again.

I'm hoping it's not the starter because online video show it'll be rather fiddly for me to change compared to the alternator."

AAMCO Technicians STUMPED  (And I'm out $1,500)
Hi all — hoping someone here can shed some light on this. My 2016 Ford Mustang EcoBoost is throwing a persistent **P0717 code** (Input/Turbine Speed Sensor “A” No Signal), and even after **replacing the sensor**, the issue came back almost immediately. AAMCO has now had the car for two more full days and can’t identify what’s still wrong. I’m stuck without a car and would hugely appreciate any insights from this community.

**Vehicle:**

* 2016 Ford Mustang EcoBoost
* 4-cylinder, 2.3L turbocharged
* Automatic transmission (6R80)

**Background & What’s Been Done:**

* My usual mechanic pulled the **P0717 code** and confirmed that the speed sensor in this car is located inside the transmission, integrated into the **lead frame (conductor plate)**.
* They referred me to AAMCO, who:
   * Removed the transmission pan
   * Found clean fluid and no debris
   * Replaced the **OEM conductor plate / lead frame** (includes the input speed sensor)
   * **Reinstalled the Transmission Control Module (TCM)** as part of reassembly
   * Topped off fluid and filter
   * Charged \~$1,500 for the work
* As soon as I left the lot, the car **lurched into gear**, threw the **same wrench light**, and repeated the original issue.

# Current Symptoms:

**Acceleration**

* When I step on the gas, the engine will sometimes rev with **no acceleration**.
* The car will then suddenly **lurch into gear**, sometimes causing the wheels to chirp.
* These events are almost always followed by the **wrench light**.
* When coasting, the car doesn’t decelerate naturally.
* This behavior happens **most often after the car sits for a few hours** (cold start).
* Also — we’ve been having **very hot weather** lately, in case that matters.

**A/C Fan Fluctuation**

* For several months before the P0717 showed up, the **A/C blower fan would randomly surge or dip in speed** without touching controls.

**iPhone Overheating Warning**

* Once, while charging my iPhone in the car, I received a **“temperature warning”** on the phone.
* Could be unrelated, but it’s never happened in that position in my car before.

**Diagnostic Procedures Reported (per AAMCO):**

* **Transmission fluid:** Clean, full, no odor or debris
* **Input speed sensor resistance:** Tested out of spec (justified replacement)
* **Alternator:** Reportedly tested under load and at startup — “checked out”
* **Test drives:** They’ve driven the car multiple times but **cannot replicate the issue**
* **TCM:** Physically reinstalled during reassembly, but unclear whether any adaptive reset or relearning was performed

Meanwhile, **every time I drive it**, the problem returns within minutes.

**Other Notes:**

* I installed a **new battery about a year ago**. The install seemed fine, and the car has run well since — but I mention it in case a loose connection or grounding issue is affecting voltage delivery.

**My Theory (as a non-expert):**

While I know the input speed sensor was replaced, I keep thinking this is **electrical**:

* Maybe the **alternator is intermittently faulting**, and it just hasn’t happened while under test?
* Maybe it’s a **wiring or connector issue** — something degrading signal to the TCM or sensor intermittently?
* I wonder if the **TCM wasn’t reset or adapted** after installing the new lead frame?



It feels like AAMCO isn’t super eager to keep chasing it down since they’ve already done the repair and been paid. So I’m here, hoping someone has seen this before.

Any thoughts or next steps I could suggest to the shop?

Thanks in advance! "

Honda 2016 2.0 Back Up Camera turning on when pressing the Brake.
Hi everyone, I have a 2016 Honda Civic with just over 100k miles and the engine is the 2.0 non turbo one. About 2-3 years ago this camera flickering would start. Times it would turn switch on when I pressed the brakes and times where it would be normal for months on and on. Now, it’s just been like this for the past year and some time. Everytime I press the brake, the camera switches to the back. I mean to be honest it was pretty cool to have the back up camera and seeing directly behind me on the highway, but it looks like the issue is spreading to other parts of the car. When i turn the blinker on, the screen flickers black. Sometimes the blinker would blink rapidly and then slow down. I noticed at times the back turn signals would switch between the brake lights. So my brake lights would blink instead of my turn signals lights. Just recently now I noticed the trunk wouldn’t open last month. I would press the button to open it on my keys and in the car and i could hear the electrical part trying to open it but it wasn’t strong enough. Even the light would dim out halfway trying to unlock the trunk. My battery was replaced in 2021, but I haven’t had any issues with starting the car. 2-3 after I had gotten the battery replaced i had some issues but i believed they were fixed when i cleaned all the air filters. What’s the best way to go about this? I was planning to go to Honda and I know they will charge me more and I guess that’s not really the problem, but I’m looking for second opinions on how to go about it. 

Also would appreciate any tune ups that I should do while at it! I am just over 100k so i want to get it all good to 200k"

1994 Winnebago Vectra 35rq no start
I have a 1994 Winnebago Vectra 35 RQ with 5.9 Cummins Diesel and WTECII Allison transmission that will not start. We had a problem with the batteries and got that figured out, but that's when we started having problems with it starting. It would take a few tries of cycling the starting process before it would actually turn over and start. Eventually it just wouldn't start. Both the chasis battery and the house batteries are fully charged, the airbrake warning buzzer still turns on when we start the ignition sequence like it always has since we bought it. We've tried replacing the starter solenoid, the ignition and the starter, it has new batteries, we checked all fuses that we could find. We used an multimeter to test the fuse/circuit board(can't think of the technical name sorry) that's in the front of the motor for the neutral safety switch. It did not produce any sound from the multimeter. The transmission shifter pad that's in the cab does not light up when trying to start. That part is a $1600 part rebuilt. We've never actually gotten to use the darn thing, we drive it home, cleaned it and stored it. And then all this started. We just want to get rid of it at this point, but can't sell it in it's current condition. Please any advice, greatly appreciated. "

2014 Honda CRV randomly won’t start
Hello!

I have a 2014 Honda CRV 2.4-liter inline-four engine that wont start at random times. This began about 2 weeks ago. I would turn the key and all electric would come on (a/c, lights, etc) but the engine wouldn’t turn over and no mechanical noises like clicking, grinding, anything. Nothing at all. I’d turn everything off, wait a moment, try again and it would start. Last Saturday it happened but this time it wouldn’t start at all. I called AAA who gave me a jump start, I immediately went and changed the battery in case that was the issue. Took it to mechanic Monday, they ran diagnostics specifically checking the alternator and said it was charging fine and they couldn’t find anything wrong. No problems until the next day when it wouldn’t start. I tried twice, 5 min in between and nothing. Waited 20 min, and then it started. I took it back to mechanic who said it could be one of the batter cables that they “didn’t like the look of” and replaced it. That was Tuesday. Thursday it did it again, but this time started on the second try within 30 seconds. 

I’m a bit frustrated as I don’t have transport means without my car and where I live isn’t walkable. 

Any ideas? Could it be the starter? Should they have been able to catch that?"

2012 Hyundai Elantra Won’t Start
My 2012 Hyundai Elantra won’t start even with a jump and the dash lights/clock won’t turn on unless it’s on jumper cables. It makes a steady clicking noise when I turn the key over. I took the battery to AutoZone for them to charge it because that’s the most obvious problem it could have, but they said it was fully charged. Would a bad starter do this?

WWYD 99 F250 SD won't charge battery
About 1 1/2 years ago, while my SIL was borrowing it, my truck was broken into --  steering column ripped out, door handles broken, stuff stolen. They broke off their screwdriver, tho, so couldn't get it started. Towed it home. 

Just before that, it threw a sparkplug. I don’t know if there might be a relationship to my problem now, but he kept driving it without telling me. 

Truck sat until a few weeks ago when a mechanic friend fixed the sparkplug and steering column. It appeared that the old battery wouldn't hold a charge,  so I had a new one installed. Now that battery also dies. 

The truck starts and runs better than ever when jumped,  or when I charge it overnight. But it's obviously not generating the battery when driven. 

My friend came back, and we tested every fuse, and everything else he could think of to test. All is well, including the alternator.  He suggested I take it to Les Schwab and have them retest the battery and alternator. They initially told me that both are good, but then said the alternator reads a little high.

As everyone I've talked to about this told me to, I have driven it for 20+ minutes several times -- 45 minutes after leaving Schwab's. At home,  I shut it off, then restarted. Left the charger off, tried it the next morning,  and again the battery was dead.

When running,  the gauge reads about halfway, and does not fluctuate. I don't actually know just what the gauge is reading  -- the battery level? The alternator output?

I need to know where to go from here. 

Does the high alternator reading suggest that I replace it?

Should I instead start by replacing the battery wires?

Other suggestions? 

I hate to ask to my friend to minutely check every wire and connection,  but I know I can't as I don’t know enough. 

I will be greatly appreciative of anything anyone can suggest. As I'm not motor savvy in the least, I'd also appreciate any information shared be dumbed down. "

2015 Honda Civic Check Charging System Light
2015 Honda Civic ~95000 miles

I’m having an issue with my check charging system light coming on intermittently. It came on during a road trip but then didn’t come on for the entire back. A couple weeks later it came on and I kept getting weak starts, unsurprisingly after a bit the car wouldn’t start. 

Figured it was my battery so I had it replaced and the alternator checked by a mechanic. Alternator output voltage was good cold/under load, and the belt was fine. I figured it’d be okay after that. The next day the light came on after half a mile of driving and turned off once I stopped. It’s since come on maybe two or three times with days or even a week in between, but always turns off once I stop the car.

I’ve checked the terminals and played with the cables, everything seems tight/clean/not corroded as far as I can tell. I’ve not noticed any difference in how it drives or starts or anything, it seems fine, so i’m not sure what the problem is.

Any ideas? "

2014 Kia Sorrento will crank but won't start after a short drive.
Hello all,

I'm scratching my head on this one.  I have a friend with a 6cyl, 2014 Kia Sorrento (2wd) that just started doing this.  First thing in the morning (and only first thing in the morning), if she goes for a short drive, about 5 minutes or so, and shuts the car off, it will not start again.  It will crank like crazy but won't fire.  She took it to a car parts store where they tested the starter (for some reason), the battery and the alternator.  They said the starter and the battery were good but the alternator was bad.  We replaced the alternator but she still has the problem.  I did some more testing this morning and while it was cranking, there was no spark.  I hooked up a little jump pack and it started right up...and I mean right up.  This sounds like a battery problem...maybe having a hard time charging, even though it tested good (for levels of tested good at a car parts store)?  Or the alternator we put in was bad also.  I'd hate to have her drop a couple hundred on a new battery just to find out it wasn't the problem.  I don't know how old the battery is as it's mostly covered when it's in there and I couldn't read the codes.  I suggested she get the alternator we just put in tested also but any thoughts on where to go from here would be appreciated.  Thanks!"

2012 Honda Civic burning through alternators and batteries
My 2012 Civic 1.8 has had an ongoing problem for the 8ish years I’ve owned it. Car will have gradually more and more trouble starting, so I’ll take it to have it tested and told the alternator is outputting low voltage and the battery isn’t holding a charge, so I’ll replace them both. Car runs fine for 12-18 months and the cycle repeats. 

I’m in Florida and I understand battery life isn’t as long here but this seems fast? 

A few weeks ago the problem started again and yesterday the car didn’t start for the first time this go around. I jumped it, ran a few short errands, and the car starts up fine every time. Then it sits overnight and struggles/doesn’t start until I jump it. 

Does this sound electrical or maybe something else?  Have a multimeter and can post any readings needed to diagnose. "

Alternator Issues On Kia Sedona
Hello! 

I have been having issues with my 2017 Kia Sedona lately related to what I believe is the alternator. It started having power issues a while back ago that it would struggle with accelerating and driving. Then one day, it just completely died out after a day driving around. I got it jumped off but it died again. Tested it with a multimeter when I got it towed home and the battery wasn't getting charged (12.4 V idle).

I replaced the alternator with a new Carquest alternator, and it tested well after with a solid 14.3 volts on the battery when idle. But, when I test drove it, it started having similar issues and when I tested again, it wasn't charging again. If I take off battery and let it reset after sitting awhile, the alternator will work again. I checked connections, found the positive terminal was pretty loose (apparently this is a common problem with this car and aftermarket batteries). I shimmed up the terminal and even got a new battery. It drove better with the new one but when I got home I tested it again and the car was at 12.5 V.  Took off the battery, let it sit for a while, then alternator works again. 

Is this a bad alternator from the box or could this be an issue with the ECU? All fuses tested good with the multimeter so far. "

Replacing Solder Joints in a Car 2017 Honda Civic
So, I'm not a car guy but the guy that owned my 2017 Honda Civic before me was a real fan of soldering wire to wire and a lot of his connections are coming undone and causing problems with my speaker and rear turn signal. Learning how to fix this to avoid going to the mechanic and getting charged a fortune. Just want to make sure I understand the process. Would I basically replace any solder joints with the process outlined in this video I linked and then the terminals from this kit would fit into what is on the car? Would appreciate any feedback since I'm new to this. I've done electronic circuits before but not much car stuff. Was also trying to figure what gauge wire would be needed? Seeing 16 but just wanted to confirm.

Oil Change Mess-up Help
I took my 2018 Mini Cooper Countryman to a smaller oil change place near my hometown. While there they told me that none of them were mechanics. That’s fine no big deal it’s just an oil change, heck I’d have my partner do it if they were in town but they weren’t. As I was waiting the manager pulled me out to say “your oil pan is stripped and will leak oil, whoever did it last is probably the one who did it.” I found that odd since it has never leaked, none of my family members or partner has ever noticed it, and my dashcam has never caught any spots where it was leaking. But whatever he just charged me for parts and said it shouldn’t be too bad and that none of them noticed it was stripped until they were trying to put the plug back in the pan. I drive back to where I’m staying and notice it’s not leaking a little bit… it’s leaking a lot. Like all the oil they put in is coming out along with my wiper fluid reservoir now leaking severely too. My reservoir did have a leak but never anything too major, maybe a drop here or there. To frame how bad my car was leaking it was bad enough to where we had to drive it to a mechanic who is authorized to work on Minis because if we didn’t then it wasn’t going to drive at all. We called them because it’s not right the amount it’s leaking and my dad told them if they had seen any evidence of caulk or pipe tape to hide the threads they should not have worked on it but the fact they didn’t and that now all of a sudden it’s leaking like crazy is a problem. 

So tell me Reddit, what do you think happened with it? Attached are photos of how much wiper fluid and oil was leaking. "

Pepboys did a 3step fuel service and throttle body clean and now my car is tweaking
I got a 3 step fuel service and throttle body cleaning from pepboys just to do preventative maintenance and improve mpg. I have a 2020 jeep compass 95,xxx. When I got the car back I noticed oil stains on the front on the car and I noticed it was burning gas fast as hell. When I took it on the street it drove and then jerked hard as hell and over revved and then continued to drive. I thought it was just the car adjusting after the cleaning so I kept driving. I noticed the car guzzled gas and my mpg was a lot worse than before I expected it to be way better, also the car felt hotter than usual when standing near the engine. I called pepboys back and asked them to look at the car because it was driving funny. They kept telling me to give it some time and that what they did wouldn’t do that to the car, they were just like all we did was the 3 step and the throttle body cleaning we don’t know why the car is holding gears longer and burning gas fast maybe the service made a problem your car already had more visible. ( The car was fine before the service) They finally told me to bring it back and said they could look at it and let their tech test drive it but they would charge for a engineers diagnostic ( even tho I had a warranty on the work and the engine diagnostic should have been free because yall just did this work on my car and I had a problem and now they don’t wanna honor the warranty) so the tech look it over and test drove the car, he was driving fast af and I told him that’s not the problem we switched seats and I drove the car normally and the car overrevved and held 3rd gear long as hell for no reason and I was like yes that’s my problem it holds gears longer than usual it usually shifts at 1.5-2k but it was going higher like 2.5-3k some times higher. So the tech was like yeah maybe you need a trans flush idk. When we got back to pepboys the manager advised again the trans flush. When I told him I was still having problems he told me that they didn’t do anything to cause them and he said I could go to another pep boys and have them check it out. So I went to another pep boys I showed them my receipt and they gave me a free engine diagnostic since I had a warranty on the work they just did the other pepboys was tryna charge me like $130 even tho they did the work and it should have been free cause I have a warranty on the service. The other location said the first place did half of the job which is why it was running funny they said the internals didn’t look clean and there is usually cleaning residue left behind and mine had no residue left behind. The other agreed to redo the 3 step and throttle cleaning and also suggested new spark plugs and 02 sensors to fix the problem the other location caused by doing a half ass job. I thought everything was fine and ended up getting a refund from the initial service $267.74. I paid 686.43 to fix the mistakes made by the first pepboys and the area director didn’t wanna refund me the 686.43 because he said that the second place did the job right (even tho I had to pay 686.43 to fixed the problem caused by the first pepboys) I just accepted it and was happy the car was back to normal there was no jerking when I immediately drove off like the first time. I thought everything was good until I noticed over time the car was still over revving and holding gears long especially on hot days or with the ac on or a combination of both also the trans temp was running hotter than usual 230f on a 73f day with the ac on. I filed a complaint again and told them my car still isn’t fixed and that the first pepboys caused wear and tear on my car by denying to fix their work and saying they didn’t do anything when the second place said they did the job wrong (I still had to drive for work and stuff). I got the first job done on 4-22 and got the second job done on 5-17 so I had to drive for almost a month on a bad tune because they declined to fix their work and kept turning me away until finally they told me to have another pepboys check it because they were confident they didn’t cause the issue. My car was fine before all this and now the trans temp went up and it overrevs and holds gears longer plus i didn’t get a mpg boost and I lost gas range. Does anyone have any advice or does anyone suggest a trans drain and fill, but before a trans drain and fill I’d definitely like my $686 back and for them to get my car driving the way it was before I came in. Also I had to hound them for my first refund I had to dm on instagram and call daily as the people from corporate never returned my calls called until I blew up customer service with emails, calls, and dms on instagram. Yes I know going to pepboys was silly but the dealership was expensive, booked out for weeks, and doesn’t give out loaner cars. So I did pepboys to do some penetrative maintenance and be in and out. Does anyone have any advice so I can get my money back and get my car fixed properly on pepboys dime. I also sent them proof of my gas range loss and pics of the oil stains left on my car. I used to get 300+ miles on a full tank now I get like 250"

OSRAM NIGHT BREAKER LED SPEED H7  installed – persistent humming noise and dashboard error (Hyundai Tucson 2017)
I recently installed OSRAM H7 LEDriving Speed bulbs in my 2017 Hyundai Tucson (halogen headlight version). The installation was easy and the lights work well without flickering or brightness issues.

However, I noticed two problems:

A constant humming noise when the lights are on and ignition is switched on (engine off).
A warning light on the dashboard indicating a bulb failure, even though the LEDs work fine.
These bulbs are passively cooled with no fan, so the source of the noise is unclear. I did not install a CANBUS adapter, as my vehicle was not listed as requiring one according to OSRAM.

I’m trying to find out:
– Is this kind of humming normal for this LED model?
– Would a CANBUS adapter or error canceller fully solve the warning and noise?
– Can this low power draw affect other systems like battery charging?

Any advice from someone with a similar setup would be greatly appreciated."

Intermittent immobiliser issues - Honda Civic Si 2010 1.4 vtec (UK)
Hey guys. I’m totally stumped. 

My civic has been having the green flashing key showing up intermittently. Roughly every week or so over the past 6 weeks. 

First thought it was a key problem, had a locksmith look at it and he said despite the shell being beat up the chip is actually fine. He couldn’t programme a cloned key into the car due to some ECU error he was getting.  So no charge and no new key for me. 

The issue seems to resolve overnight or after two days. Previously all it took was messing with the key, a few prayers, and it started just fine. 

I bought a multi meter, and saw that my battery dipped below 10v at crank, and then learned that my cheap Lion battery that I bought 6 months ago was only 35ah and not the recommend 40ah. Replaced with a Yuasa Silver and all seemed fine. 

Drove around for a week and all good, so went to get my AC fixed, new condenser and pipe, £450 out of pocket. Next day drove around during day, and then quick trip to my sisters house and the car locked me out again. 

Spoke to another locksmith, and he was also stumped. Understood that the immobiliser issue is really common when the battery is changed - but that wouldn’t happen a week after that was done, or even day after if the AC fix disconnected the battery. 

I’m stuck now. Don’t know what to do. Not working atm, so the 450 I paid for AC was the last bit of cash I’d be willing to part with for the car. 

Has anyone had a simmilair issue? I’d really appreciate any advice as I love this car but I’m seeing no other option than to scrap it as it’s not economically viable to keep fixing it. "

What am I missing in diagnosing AC issue
So here's my problem, I have a 2012 GMC Savana and every time I turn on my AC it just blows hot. Now as an HVAC Tech I know my way around AC system but what I have going on just completely stumps me and before I spend money that I don't have trying to fix my work van I'd like to get your guys's opinion. So I pulled the refrigerant (134a) out and weighted in the correct charge (.810 kg). My suction pressure is 36.3 psi and liquid pressure is 178.1 psi. Still blowing out hot air. Then I thought it might be my mixed air louver so I taped up a needle nose vise grip and clamped off one of the lines going to my heating core and after I did that it started blowing cooler air for about 20 minutes and then the next time I started my van nothing but hot air again. I can see that the motor for the mixed air is moving something cuz when I turn the dial to heat or cool it does move. I'm just stumped I don't know where else to go from here. Any advice would be helpful. "

A/C flickering, could this have happened during a recent repair?
I know literally nothing about cars. I have a 2015 Acura MDX with 70k miles that has never had issues until last week when the check engine light came on with an “emissions system problem” warning. It’s up to date on maintenance and well cared for. 

I took it in to get fixed at the mechanic I use for everything, they said a seal on the air intake was cracked and replaced it, which was apparently labor intensive. The a/c was doing this when I picked it up, they now insist it was doing this when I brought it in. It’s pretty apparent and I’m in South Texas so the a/c is always going full blast so I just feel like I would have noticed it and I definitely would have been concerned enough to bring it in if I had noticed it. Is it possible they mixed up something electrical when doing the work or diagnostics and are trying to save face/charge me to fix the issue they caused? 

Also, the emissions system warning came on again today and my car basically broke down while I was driving home, so it’s back with them anyway because they clearly missed something initially. "

2007 VW Rabbit AC is broken
I was given my stepmoms old Rabbit a few years ago, and it had a host of problems from day one, the main one being the AC is broken. I know absolutely nothing about cars, and no mechanic wants to even touch it cause it's a VW, which leaves me with the dealership, but they want to charge $120 for an overnight diagnosis, which I don't have. Anyone have any kind of ideas on what the damage could be so I'm not paying out of pocket to figure this out?

The AC doesn't turn on unless its on max strength, and the air coming out is from outside PLUS being heated by something no matter what settings. I know cause I've tested on cold nights, and the recycler and heater were both off. The refrigerant isn't the problem cause its maxed out, and it doesn't seem to be emptying at all cause I checked last year and a few months ago, and both times it was full. The only thing I can think of is some kind of wiring, but again, I know nothing about cars so I wouldn't know how to check."

A/C Clutch Won't Engage
Hey everyone,

I bought a 2002 Impala LS (3.8L) last July knowing the A/C wasn’t working. Since then, I’ve done quite a bit of troubleshooting myself (I am no mechanic) and had multiple techs look at it with no solid answers.

Today, I had a new hi-low pressure switch installed and the system was charged with freon. The clutch still would not engage. The mechanic then mentioned the computer and the ground wire. He stated he leaned more towards the computer. He advised me to take it to the dealership, which from experience is costly.

Information I know:

\-A new compressor was installed before I bought this car

\-The compressor clutch will engage and run *only* when jumped directly.

\-It will not engage on its own.

From what I can tell, the car has had a lot of work done in the past—there are new parts everywhere, and I’ve noticed electrical tape on some wiring/components.

Work done while in my possession:

\-New A/C hose

\-Full freon recharge

\-Wiring inspection

\-Fuse and relay check

\-New hi-low pressure switch

I’m at a loss here. I’m just trying to get some cold air before summer gets any worse. Anyone who has experience with problems like mine, please advise me or give me guesses. I would like to know thoughts on this before I throw more money into my car. I don't want to give up on my car either, as it's mechanically sound everywhere else."

Ford Fiesta 2015 Temp sensor problem?
My coolant had a problem a month or two ago where out of nowhere it started bubbling and smoking after idling for over 30 minutes and we learned that the radiator fan stopped working. I still had to drive back home that night, but luckily it was cool enough that during the 2 hour drive home the temp gauge stayed perfectly at the middle the whole time. We get back and to my surprise the fan started working again. The next day I flushed out the whole system in case the problem was air bubbles in the lines or anything. 2 months pass and there isn’t a single problem except that the fan still doesn’t turn on every time. A few days ago I was stuck in a line for about 30 minutes and I look up and my temp gauge was back at the top and there was bubbling and smoke coming from my coolant reservoir again. Fan still didn’t kick on. I just wanted to come here and see what people might think it is because I don’t have enough money to get it diagnosed anywhere around me because they all charge around $100 for 30 minutes and I’d much rather try my luck with fixing it myself if the problem seems clear enough. My guess is I have a faulty temp sensor, thermostat, or relay which is why the fan still works sometimes. I don’t really know too much about cars though so I could just be talking out of my ass.

Hi there its a long one, sorry! Just looking for some advice before i bring in my car for the 4th time in 3 weeks.  My 2016 Honda Accord 2.5L was making a loud, engine straining noise about 3wks ago and the place i brought it said it was my alternator and replaced it. He put in a Rebuilt one from i dont kno where. A few days later my rpms were very low and my car was losing power running the ac, guy insisted there was nothing wrong, refused to even look, so i left. 2 weeks ago ""Check Charging System"" comes on, i bring it to the Honda Dealer who clears the code, tells me nothing is wrong, sends me on my way. Same noise happens, same loss of power using the AC, i take it to a different priv shop who finds a giant hole in my air intake hose, and dirty throttle body. They fix that. Same rpm issue happens again last week, and Check Engine light comes on, i go back again, the new priv shop says its giving a code for ""Higher Than Expected Rpms"". They reset the Idle control valve sensor, recheck throttle body, clear the code. Car was fine for a few days, now rpm issues AGAIN, and ""Check Charge System"" error message comes on AGAIN today. What the heck is causing this problem?? Ive never ever had problems with this car before, and now im having issues non stop. I am convinced its the alternator the first guy put in. Can anybody PLEASE give me advice !!! "

Need to order a remanufactured computer for a 2006 Dodge Dakota and hoping for advice on where to order it from.
Title is the short of it. I've narrowed down my problem to a faulty computer. Checked the connections and replaced the spark plugs and ignition coils but they keep getting to much charge. So I've gotta go ahead and eat the cost of a new one. Hoping someone has a good recommendation on where to order a programmed remanufactured computer from."

Focus AC failure
I’ve got a 2012 Ford Focus with an AC issue I’m trying to pin down before I take it in for full service. The system is properly charged, and pressures read normal according to the gauge. When it’s cooler outside (under ~74°F), it blows coolish air, but as soon as the outside temp gets warmer, the AC blows nothing but hot air.

I had a local garage take a quick look. The mechanic said the compressor isn’t kicking on. He even tried tapping on the compressor to see if it would engage, but nothing happened. No obvious noises or grinding, just seems like the compressor isn’t doing anything.

Before I hand over a chunk of change for diagnostics and repair, I’m trying to get an idea of what the issue might be. Any thoughts on where to start? Compressor clutch? Pressure switches? Electrical issue? I’ve heard these cars can have problems with the AC clutch gap or failing relays, but I’m not sure what’s most likely given these symptoms.

Any advice or personal experience with this would be greatly appreciated!

Battery going flat but no parasitic drain and alternator is working properly
The battery of my 2011 BMW F11 525D keeps going flat over time and I can't figure out the issue. Here is where I'm at in the diagnostic. Sorry if don't use the right words, I'm not knowledgeable in electrical stuff but I know how to follow instructions from tutorials. Used a multimeter for diagnostic, I also have an ODB plug with the full bimmertool and bimmercode apps. 
- New battery, registered with the ODB tool.
- Voltage of the new battery was initially good, about 12.9 volts with the engine off. 
- Voltage when the engine is running is about 14.9 volts. From my understanding it indicates that the alternator is properly charging the battery.

The battery went flat like the old one. Did not checked the voltage but had to start the car with a booster every single time. 
- Voltage when engine is running: 14.9 volts
- checked for a parasitic draw by disconnecting the negative terminal of the battery, terminal of the multimeter in Amp port and connected to the negative battery cable and the other terminal with the battery's negative. Let the car goes into 'sleep mode'. Reading is about 0.03. From my understing there's no parasitic draw.

In the meantime I charged the old battery with a universal battery charger and after a full night it showed 12.9 volts, put it back on the car to recharge up the new battery. Same deal again it's getting weaker over time. Just checked, it's showing 12.45 volts. Reading for alternator and parasitic draw show no issu. 
The beamer tool app I dictates with the engine running:
- battery voltage: 14.9V
- battery current: 2.6A
- generator current: 26 to 27A.

So if the battery is good at the beginning, no alternator issue and no parasitic draw, what could be the problem??

Edit for additional information: the battery cables and terminals are clean and without any corrosion (as it's under the boot on BMW it's protected). I'm driving about 350km every weekends in winter and 20 km on weekends when ski season in over. Not on working days, and about 800 km every two months, same use I had for 4-5 years but the issue began about 1 year ago. Climate is not extreme, western EU so -5°C to 35°C at worst."

Report from Launch Creeder Elite 2.0
I’m an idiot and let a corrupt auto shop drain me of my finances and give me my car back to me in worse condition. I wasn’t thinking clearly at the time but now realizing it was probably just the battery that needed charging, which I was alerted about and have done since. I was continuously harassed and paid ended up paying over 6k in addition to the 5k my insurance paid them. They took advantage of the fact that I was in the hospital and complained about having to deal with a third party on my behalf (my mom, who they harassed too). They had me pay for a ton of unauthorized services when I specifically stated multiple times that I didn’t want started until the adjuster provided an estimate and the amount they would cover, since I would’ve taken it to a shop they cover on the list they provided on the insurance site. I was also charged additional fees since the field inspector didn’t show up when he was supposed to and told about additional daily storage fees that would apply 30 minutes before it would take effect. I called the police for a civil standby which ended up useless since it’s a civil matter and pissed them off even further, resulting in even higher payments. At this point I’m too tired and don’t have the energy to fight this anymore. I only care if my car is safe to drive. Can anyone please advise if the airbag message indicates that it’s a faulty sensor or something mechanical? And if all the warning indicators are related to the same problem (as a car enthusiast friend had advised me)? I know I need to take it to the dealership now, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place since the preowned car dealership only gave me 1 set of keys that ended up breaking and I paid around $700 just for one new key fob at the dealership. I feel completely stupid and regretful for dragging my mom into this mess—lesson learned for next time. I don’t know much about cars and would appreciate any insight into this report. For reference, it’s a 2020 CLA 250 coupe that I bought this past new year and was completely torn apart, which is why I’m hoping it’s just faulty sensors/a simple electronics fix and wondering how much it would cost me. Thanks in advance."

Intermittent no start troubleshooting
2007 Mazda 3 2.3L Manual Transmission 

Hello, I've been trying to get to the bottom of my intermittent no start issue. Here is some context. 

About 4 months ago I tried starting my car and all I heard was a click but no start. I suspected the starter so I checked the relay, applied power, and fuse and both were fine. I even swapped the heater relay, exact same relay, and the problem still persisted intermittently. I then bypassed the starter relay and tested the starter by jumping the 30 and 87 wires. The starter engaged right away. Anyways I could figure out what was causing it so I left it alone and the problem went away. 

Fass forward to earlier this week, the intermittent no start is back. All I hear is a single click and no start. This time it took me about 10 tries to get my engine to run, compared to 2-5 tries before. A couple days ago it took me 2 tries to get it to start. Today it's been normal. Here is what I have done so far this week:
- Tested Starter relay ✔️
- Bypassed starter relay ✔️ Starter turns over
- Tested battery voltage with engine off ✔️ 12.6 volts
- Tested battery voltage with engine on ✔️ 13.9 volts
I did replace the clutch a few weeks back and cleaned the starter terminals. 

I finally took my car to AutoZone to get it tested. 
The battery and starter pass but the alternator failed. 
I then took my car to another AutoZone to double check and was told the same thing. The tester they used showed: Bad Charging System charging current failed. I will post the results. 

Idk why but I don't believe it. When I read the battery voltage with the engine running I get 13.9 volts so I assume the alternator is working. I personally think it's the starter intermittently not working but I can't prove it. 

What are your thoughts or test recommendations? I don't want to swap in a new alternator and have that not be the problem. "

2014 Hyundai accent GLS
A bit of a long story. Three weeks ago my wife was driving her car and the battery light started to flicker on and off. I got the charging system tested and it said my alternator was going. To avoid any stalls I got it changed the next day. After it being changed the car now randomly will lose power steering, abs break light, ac stops blowing cold air. Also when she turns it off it won’t turn back on for about 10mins to a few hours.I had them take it back thinking the alternator was bad. They checks everything and saids it’s great(they can never replicate in the shop). It happens again two days later. I have them change the alternator again and I end up putting a new battery in and clean the negative terminal since it had corrosion on it. I’m just wondering does anyone have any idea what this is? Before the alternator was changed the car never had any problems??"

Weird electric/whine noise in 2012 civic
Hey I recently noticed this noise in my civic. It’s a 2012 civic 1.8l 4 cylinder. The noise is most prevalent in the 1-3000 rpm ranges, and goes up with throttle. I don’t believe it is affecting performance. I replaced the alternator 2 months ago and haven’t had any charging problems, and that is what I believe it to be, but wanted to get some other opinions. Thank you. "

Warranty + Non-Warranty Work on AC (2018 Honda Civic)
Looking for any advice I can get about how to approach an unusual scenario!

My 2018 Honda Civic's AC stopped working (blows warm air). I initially planned to visit a local mechanic I've worked with before, but after reviewing online, I saw the AC condenser is under extended warranty (up to 10 years) as is the compressor shaft seal, so I went to a dealership instead.

The dealership charged me for inspection and confirmed that the freon had all leaked out due to the defective condenser, which they'd replace for free. However, they said the compressor had also seized and that they wouldn't replace the condenser without fixing that first, and the cost of that would be in addition to the inspection fee I already paid. The warranty extension on the compressor wont cover it since it's not the shaft seals.

Frustrating, to say the least, and it makes me never want to purchase a Honda again since it seems like the only reason the compressor would have seized would be due to the problem with the defective condenser. 

Based on every source I can find, the quote is way above average or even maximum thresholds for this type of repair.

So a few questions I could use some advice on:

1) Should I call multiple dealerships to compare prices? I'm concerned that if each will want to inspect the car separately and charge me for it, I'll get stuck with several bills for inspections.

2) Is it a viable option to have the compressor done independently, then return to the dealership that gave me the initial quote to complete the condenser repair under warranty?

3) Can I do this in the reverse order- leaning on Honda corporate to have the dealership replace the condenser under warranty, THEN go to an independent shop to replace the compressor?

4) Should I be pushing Honda to refund me for the initial inspection, given that it was a defective part under warranty that caused it? The bill from the dealership indicates that because they found another issue not under warranty (the compressor), they aren't going to refund me for the inspection cost.

5) I paid $180 for the initial inspection, and the quote for the AC Compressor is $2400. Are those within reasonable ranges for this type of work?

Thanks a million in advance for any advice. "

Am I right to be suspicious that a mechanic shop sabotaged my car to get me to pay for repairs I didn't need?
I have a 2016 Hyundai Veloster and my engine would sometimes shut off while idling at stop lights with the check engine light, battery light, and oil light coming on. When I restart it, the car would go back to normal. 

First I took it to the dealership because I have an engine recall on it, but the dealership couldn't find anything wrong and ended up not charging me diagnostics and just had me pick up the car.

Then, my dad vouched for the local chain mechanic shop down the street. I didn't really want to take it to them because I saw them as more of a brake change/oil change place, but my dad was adamant that they know their stuff. It takes them around 3/4 days to diagnose my car stating they didn't have the correct parts to diagnose it etc... Then finally they call and say my high pressure fuel pump needed to be changed as well as my ac compressor. I went ahead and did the repairs it was over 3k. Then I pick my car up and it stops again while idle. We bring it back to them and they said that i needed a new fuel pump. I was confused because I thought I got a new one already, but he said I needed to change the one in the gas tank. They said they couldn't differentiate which fuel pump was bad. My former boss told me that they will make up things to repair, so at this point I picked my car up without doing any more repairs to take it to a real mechanic. This shop had my car for almost 2 weeks. 

The real mechanic called within an hour and a half to tell me that immediately, the idle throttle body code came on that it was failing. I got my car back in less than a day and the problem was resolved. Then my car suddenly had the RPM drop to zero and I was no longer accelerating and it was fixed restarting my car a couple times. So I took it back to my mechanic and he said he found that the solenid was leaking oil and that a hose from the fuel system had been replaced. In my vehicle, it's supposed to be curved, but someone put in a brand new one that was bent to fit in my car. My car hasn't been to a shop for repairs since the first year I got it in 2017 and I had no issues with the RPM until I got my car back from the first mechanic shop. This part was not on the invoice for the high pressure fuel repair. 

Am I right in thinking they put this part in to get bad readings from my fuel pump to get my money? Not only did they misdiagnose my vehicle, but my AC now sounds like a cricket lives in it despite paying 1400 to fix it, and now theres a suspicious hose replacement I never authorized?

I went back to the mechanic to check it again thinking it was just a bad sensor or too much pressure in the system,AGAIN i was wrong,it has nothing to do with high pressure or the sensor and now before i bring it to an automotive electrician that would charge an arm and a leg I want to know if someone here has dealt with the same problem and could tell me what to look at specifically."

Dash light problems, exciter wire?
Hi all I have a bit of a dash light problem which is causing a headscratcher for the past few weeks.

Car is a 2000 Nissan pulsar/almera N15 with the SR20de. The battery, brake lights and ABS are on in the dash. Brake lights still on after hand brake is down just dimmer, while the ABS turns on after the car is rolling (with what i assume when the speedo registers speed).

Online tells me it is likely an alternator problem however it is currently charging at 14v and battery is being charged. 

I noticed when the alternator plug is disconnected, the battery and brake lights disappear from the dash, but the abs is still there. Is this something to do with the exciter wire that is running off the plug? I read that it needs to supply 12v (when connected) back to the dash bulb to turn the light off to indicate the alternator is charging, however it seems the alternator is still charging with the lights on. 

What should I check for? Should i check the integrity of the exciter wire back to the dash? Is the abs light related to this problem? I have check each abs sensor individually and their plugs and they look fine.

Thanks!"

Merc head unit replacement
Hi team, car had been sat for about 4 months, battery was dead, Tried to jump it, didn’t jump, called out the mechanics and they jumped it with the big jump pack.

Advised to drive it and keep it running for a few hours to get some charge, did so, no joy and battery was dead.

Replaced the battery, and now the on screen display is completely dead, no radio Bluetooth etc.

Have checked all the fuses, no problems there, removed the module itself and found a dead fuse, replaced that dead fuse and it still won’t start, have checked with a multimeter and the unit is still receiving power.

Is the unit fried? Or is there anything else you guys would suggest checking/doing 

Assuming that the unit itself is fried, is the replacement job just buy a replacement unit and swap it 1 for 1, or can I buy a slightly upgraded one to be able to use CarPlay etc.

Picture attached for reference, any advise would be greatly appreciated"

Need advice on MG3 battery issue – is this normal?
Hey folks, just looking for a bit of advice here as I’m not massively clued up on cars.

I’ve got a 22 plate MG3. Back in February, I went to use the car and the battery was completely flat. I called the AA out and they replaced the battery with a brand new one.

Fast forward to this past Sunday (so early June), and again the battery is dead. Called AA out again, and this time they tested the battery and said they couldn’t find anything wrong with it said it had no faults and nothing obvious left on that would be draining it. They recommended I get it investigated.

So I phoned MG, and they said they can investigate it, and if it turns out to be a fault with the car, they’ll fix it under warranty. But if it’s a problem with the battery (despite it being new), they’ll charge me for the investigation—and it’s £155 per hour, which is a bit scary if they spend ages and find nothing.

I really don’t want to take it in unless I have to, but I feel like I’ve got no choice if I want to figure out what’s going on. Has anyone else had a similar issue with the MG3 or something like this in general? Does it sound like a problem with the car, or could the new battery still be dodgy somehow?

Any advice would be massively appreciated!"

A/C Unfixed Help Subaru
I have a 2012 Subaru forester that has been having a/c problems. I have very little mechanical knowledge. I had it fixed two years ago when it was acting up end of summer. This is what he wrote he did “Checked A/C For Leaks Replace Orings At Compresor Low And High Side Charge A/C”. That was a few hundred and it worked fine after that. Until next summer when I went to turn it on after sitting through the winter. I called him back, he said to bring it back in. That cost me $1k. This time he said he “Replaced High Side Schrader Valve”. Worked fine through rest of summer. Then again, this year, it’s not working. I’m not taking it back to him. I called someone else and they said a/c issue in Subarus are complicated and he probably couldn’t fix it. It’s blowing slightly cold on the passenger side but if it’s hot out it’s pretty much hot air. The person I initially took it to said it was something else that I can’t remember so I just don’t know where to go from here or who to trust.

Car Died While Driving, Replaced Battery, Now Low Idle RPM and Automatic Transmission Idle Speed (It Barely Moves Forward)
Sorry for the long read. A few days ago, my 2007 Toyota Avalon stalled during a long trip. It’s the first problem I’ve ever had with the car besides basic maintenance. I got stuck on the side of the road because the car just lost power in the middle of the drive and then wouldn’t start back up. First couple attempts,it made a clicking noise, but then all the lights on the dash went out and it wouldn’t even do that. Luckily I was only about 15 miles from the end of this 200 mile trip so I towed it to my mom’s house and used a charge pack to charge the battery. It was reading like 10 volts and it would not hold a charge. Never got to the point of being able to start the car no matter how long I charged it. Took the battery in and they confirmed that it was bad battery. I assume some sort of damage. 

Replaced the battery and with the new battery the car started up right away. The voltage was in the 13s  so assumed the alternator was fine at the moment but it’s worrying that the car stalled mid drive and we didn’t discover this when trying to start up the car so we left the car running in the driveway to see if it held up. It eventually died after like 30 minutes. We assumed we must had some intermittent issue with the alternator and tried to turned the car over a few times. But it didn’t sound like a dead battery. More like it was out of gas. I had the sudden realization that we were at the end of a 200 mile trip and it was low on gas and I had been looking for a gas station exit before stalling. It hadn’t been out of gas, but I guess all the attempts to start back up and the 30 minutes running in the driveway killed the last of the gas. Went to the back of the house and grabbed the gas can and put 2 gallons of gas in and it started right back up again and it has since been running for several days since.

Unfortunately, now I’m having a weird issue on top of not knowing why the battery died mid drive if the alternator is seemingly good. Where as it used to idle around 800-900 before this whole incident, it’s now idling at 500. And you know how when you have an automatic transmission the car will move forward on its own and reverse on its own at low but consistent speed? It now barely creeps forward or reverse without using the gas pedal. Before this whole chain of events, it behaved like every other automatic I’ve ever driven. But now if there’s any sort of incline at all or even like a rough road to go over it just kind of comes slowly to a stop until you hit the gas. The idle is not rough. It runs smooth at 500 but the idle speed of the automatic transmission without being on the gas is basically not existent. The car also does not hesitate and does not have any problems when you’re on the gas. But just the way it’s idling and the automatic speed is so slow, I’m worried that something underlying is still wrong that may come up eventually when I drive back the 200 miles the other way."

How likely is it that this in an honest situation?
First I'm told I need a new catalytic converter on a 2017 Buick Encore. That gets replaced for $1100 including labor, but the Check Engine light never turns off. When I bring it back in, I'm told that an aftermarket CC was used and now that the place is under new management (yeah supposedly that happened in the 2 weeks it took me to get back in there) I'm being told a new Buick CC will cost $1900 cause ""the aftermarket ones never work"" They aren't charging me labor and are taking the original CC cost off the bill so that sounds great, except, for all I know, they botched the first one on purpose or did nothing at all (I didn't climb under the car to inspect, nor would I know the difference between original, aftermarket, or OEM) and now they have me over a barrel because taking it anywhere else I wouldn't re-coop the cost of the first CC they put in. On top of all that, now I have a problem with my Turbocharger and that WHOLE thing need replaced for $2000 more. this wasn't a problem until now, could they have caused this? Did I mention that this is also the certified place to get your emissions test done?"

Service battery charging system???
I drive a 2018 Buick Encore preferred. This morning, I was driving my son somewhere that was two minutes down the road. The entire drive, it sounded and felt like there was something hanging down from the undercarriage that kept hitting the pavement. When we got there, I turned the car off and looked underneath - everything looked normal. The drive home, the same thing happened. Fast forward an hour. I went to go pick my son up, the sound was gone, but my air conditioner wouldn’t get cold. We stopped a store on the way home. The car started losing power and blinking. Several different messages flashed randomly in the dash. The first said something about the starter. The second said the engine was overheating. I immediately shut it off. I let it sit for a few minutes to cool down. When I tried to start it again. It started and then the power fizzled out. Trying to start it again, it acted like it wanted to start, but couldn’t get enough power. I let it sit for about 5 hours, unplugged all chargers, turned off the radio, etc., and tried again. This time it started and flashed a “service battery charging system message.” I was able to drive it home. The dealership is a good 50 miles away. 

Anyone have any idea what might be the problem? Also, would it be possible to drive it to the dealership? Trying to avoid the 50 mile tow due to the distance/cost. I have a “forever warranty” on my car through the dealership that covers the engine, transmission, and drive train. A year ago, there was a cylinder misfiring that left me stranded for hours. It wasn’t covered by the warranty and cost more than a grand to fix. I think this dealership overcharges for everything, so if it’s not covered by the warranty, I’d rather save my money and tow it to a cheaper, local shop. Not sure if any of this makes sense. 

Any help would be truly appreciated. "

2019 Nissan Sentra needs transmission repair, but still owe on loan. Should I get a new car or save up for repair?
Hi, this might be kind of long, so fair warning.

I’ve been financing a 2019 Nissan Sentra SV since December 2020. The car currently has 160,000 miles on it, and I still owe $8,000 on the loan.

About a week ago, I had a diagnostic test done due to issues with acceleration (jerking when accelerating and sudden RPM jumps) and shifting problems (the car gets stuck in neutral or park). The diagnostic codes returned were: P0846, P0868, P0965, P2767, and P1715.

Other issues I’m experiencing:
	•	The car shudders when I brake hard and triggers the battery light.
	•	The front sensor malfunctions and displays a “See Owner’s Manual” warning.
	•	The check engine light comes on intermittently (sometimes it’s on when I start the car, other times it’s not).

The mechanic recommended replacing the transmission and quoted me $2,900 for a replacement (from a 2021 Nissan Sentra with around 64,000 miles) plus $1,000 for labor. He noted the issues are intermittent, which also points to a failing transmission.

Two months before this, I took the car to a transmission specialist when the shifting and acceleration issues first started. At the time, they couldn’t find any transmission problems, though the car did jerk during the road test. That mechanic recommended reprogramming the TCM.

I’m really unsure what to do next and would appreciate any advice. My credit is currently poor (622 with a charge-off and a collection), so financing another vehicle isn’t really an option right now. I’m also looking for a second job or a higher-paying one. I need my car for work.

Thanks in advance.

2013 Mazda 6 Diesel Engine Diagnosis
Hello all, I have an issue with my 2013 Mazda 6 diesel, I will list the symptoms below.

1-  Slow cranking: First start of the day is always slow to crank over. Subsequent starts throughout the day either start normally or somewhat slow. There doesn't seem to be a pattern, I could leave the car off for an hour and it will start normally or I could leave it off for 10min and it will slow crank. Battery was replaced at last service, I suspect the mechanic just heard the slow cranking and assumed battery. It masked the problem somewhat in the beginning but the slow cranking never really went away. Alternator is charging at 13.9VDC.

2- RPM bouncing while driving at low speed: When I'm driving at steady slow speed (not varying the accelerator) anywhere from 30kmh - 50kmh the RPM will bounce up and down, it causes a bunny-hopping motion in the car where it lurches forward then stops, lurches forward then stops. I have to take my foot off the accelerator or speed up to get it to stop.

3- Rough idle: Could be normal for diesel engines but at idle the RPM seems to bounce up and down. Does the attached video sound normal for a diesel engine?

4- Bad exhaust smell: Again could be normal for diesel engines for all I know but the exhaust has a very bad noxious smell that gives you a headache.

5- Not sure if this could be related, or a separate issue but I have a 'I-ELOOP Inspection Required', and 'Battery Management Inspection Required' warning lights on.



Not my area of expertise but from what I have Googled, could I have a leaking fuel injector? 

Car is going in for service in a few days so I'd like to be able to try point him in the right direction as I have raised the 'RPM bouncing while driving at low speed' issue previously.

Thanks in advance."

battery drained and negative sparking on new battery
context: i was at my girlfriends house after graduation and i heard my car start blowing air really loud like a big fan was on, then i noticed my headlight was out so i shut my car off and then a few minutes later it wasn’t making noise. then, i backed out and noticed that instead of the normal lit up backup camera i have it was purple almost like night vision or something. then as im pulling out it shuts off completely all electrical locks up the key and i can’t move the gear shifter after i put it in park. i get out and then it turns back on so i turn it over put it in gear and boom fails again. did that twice so i was like just get it to the side of the road for tn. next morning i came and battery wouldn’t charge it wasn’t starting running unusually doing everything shown in the video. 

now, after putting in a new battery the negative is sparking when i connect it. luckily i just pushed it on as tight as i could and drove it home. it had no problems then and started fine but i took it off so it didn’t drain my battery. i just don’t really know what to do, idk why its sparking. the black cover that goes on the end of the alternator power cable isn’t bolted down and was off when i looked the next morning but i just don’t really know if that even matters. also idk what the fluid is, i used to have an oil leak but i got that fixed and it was pooling up in the same spot i guess it was mixed with this red fluid maybe?"

Check charging system 2014 Ford Explorer
Hello. I have a 2014 Ford Explorer, and recently the checked charging system light came on. I did a quick Google search and figure out all of the potential things it could be. However, this occurred right after a sudden acceleration when I was merging onto a busy highway, something I don’t normally do. Is it possible that was triggered just the acceleration and will go away and not be a problem. Or, do you think that sudden acceleration triggered what is likely a problem? The vehicle drove fine for the next 3 1/2 miles until I got to my driveway. I turned the car off and I’ve not gone back outside to see if it still occurring. "

Car starts but won't run, not sure where to go from here
2007 Lexus is250 RHD  
4GR - FSE, direction injection
200,000 kms

car suddenly would not run (driven fine that morning)
- starts and revs to 2000 rpms and dies shortly after
- can keep running by spraying starting fluid directly into the throttle body
- in-tank fuel pump ok
- all fuses and relays seem to be ok
- car battery ok - never dipped below 12v, kept it charged between attempts
- tried with both keys w/ new batteries
- no codes are given and check engine light isn't on (PCS and VSC codes in video are just from the brake pedal pos sensor being unplugged - no effect on problem)
- using OBD2 scan tool when the accelerator is pressed with ignition on, the accelerator position sensor changes but the actual throttle plate does not move
- fuel rail pressure appears to be ok (reaches >10,000 kPa)

had mechanic look at it, he recommended first to replace throttle body
throttle body replaced with a used one from a 2008 model with 175k kms, issue still persists

checking the resistance values on both throttle bodies as per image in comments:
motor resistance values on both bodies are ok, but pin 3 (sensor ground, E2) and pin 5 (5v reference, VC) resistance values on both bodies are at 3k ohms
so either the diagram is not applicable or both bodies are bad in the same way?? I was not able to confirm that the used throttle body was working as I got it online from a wrecker.

Towing to a mechanic/auto electrician is my last resort, so all help right now is much appreciated!"

Alternator Replaced Now Cars Idling Rough!!
If anybody can please please give me some suggestions i would really appreciate it cuz im desperate!! I had my alternator replaced a week ago in my 2016 Honda Accord 2.4L, 120k miles. Since then, my car began to rough idle whenever i turned the ac on, and the entire car shakes hard as the rpm gauges drop down to between 300-500.
I turn the ac off and it stops. I expect a little idle/vibration as the compressor cycles but it has never done this until now. I brought my car back and the mechanic refused to even look at my car and told me nothing is wrong and if i want anything done i have to pay AGAIN!

A few days later, i now have an error code reading Check Charging System and some kickback when accelerating if i turn the ac on. Take it to the dealer this time, and they clear the code, tell me thats normal, and that its because my car is old. 
Now here i am, and my car is now rough idling and shaking intermittently whether the ac is on or off, and when the ac is on, the compressor is roughly cycling on/off every 3 seconds instead of a min or so apart. My last hope is to take it to a third shop but idk what to say/do atp. I have never had a single issue with this car!! Please help! Thanks!

***EDIT: hello everyone!! Just wanted to say thank you for all your tips! It looks like the issue was a huge tear in my air intake hose and a dirty throttle body! New mechanic i checked out showed me the damage and walked me thru everything about how it was probably causing my issues. Replaced hose, cleaned throttle body and my car is running smooth finally! No shaking, rough idle, or uncontrolled rpms! Its only been half a day but hopefully problem solved!***"

Is it normal for shops to charge $200/hr for diagnostics with no time estimate, and still charge even if you agree to the repair
Hey everyone,  
I’m running into some issues trying to get my hybrid looked at and honestly I’m a bit frustrated and confused.

I’ve been calling around shops and a lot of them are charging **$200 per hour just for diagnostics**, but they **don’t give a clear idea of how long it will take** to even figure out the problem. Some even told me that **the diagnostic charge stands whether I decide to do the repair with them or not. So, basically what** I'm seeing is that they can charge me $1000 on diagnostic and then I still have to pay for repairs.. that's insane. I understand techs have to be paid but that's disgusting . 

  
On top of that, I'm having a really hard time finding **a mechanic who specializes in hybrids**. Some shops straight up admit they don’t want to touch it. Others say they’ll “try,” but clearly don’t have the experience or confidence, which makes me nervous.

Is this just how it is now?  
Is this normal for hybrid repairs or even regular cars?  
How do people even find trustworthy hybrid mechanics anymore?"

1988 5.0L R134a conversion; Help appreciated
Hey all, I'm tackling the 134a conversion on my 1988 Ford Bronco and I'm nearly complete but I've hit a roadblock. I've just flushed out the evap and condenser and replaced my compressor, accumulator, and the suction/liquid/discharge lines. I suctioned the system to a vacuum, waited an hour to see if there were any leaks... All good it seems. Then I left the vacuum on overnight to make sure all the moisture was removed. Today, I went and tried to charge my first can of 134a but I couldn't tell that anything was actually flowing. The viewing glass looked normal and there wasn't any flow of refrigerant. After about 15 minutes, both gauges read \~50-60 PSI. I noticed that the compressor clutch wasn't engaging so I jumped the low-pressure sensor which caused it to engage (as long as I was jumping). The problem is I'm still not drawing an adequate amount of refrigerant. Anyone have any ideas? Its starting to get real hot LOL."

BMW X3 2009 157,000 miles- What is this part?
My bmw has been throwing a p0015 camshaft position timing over and a  p0303 cylinder 3 misfire (think it only misfires when i start the car). Initially saw that there was an oil leak onto the VVT sensors which was the reason for the p0015. 

So I spent $1.5k at an expensive mechanic because they’re top rated in my city, idc if i got over charged or whatever, just wanted my car fixed and you live and you learn.

They fixed the leak by replacing the Valve Cover gasket, replacing VVT sensors, and engine oil filter housing. 

Unfortunately the problem was still not fixed and they looked deeper into it and I was sent this video. (i did an engine flush 2x by myself just now so it’s not a dirty car problem). 

I want to try and replace/fix the bracket that the previous owner added for some reason near the camshaft sensor that the mechanic points out in the video. Think the previous owner did some sketchy stuff to it in order to rid the service engine light when selling it to my step dad, which is my car now. 

They requested $800-1500 for more repairs which I wasn’t paying because not only did I have to move to a different state in a week but I was getting sketched out and uncomfortable with the pricing. Car still drives fine but it’s only a matter of time and I noticed good performance some days and bad performance other days. It’s like flipping a coin.

Already changed spark plugs and fuel injectors, and used fuel system cleaner a couple of times. Did two engine flushes just now and it’s driving good again but I don’t expect the service engine light to go away until I 

1. Replace the broken engine mount he mentioned

2. Replace/figure out what is supposed to be in place of that bracket. 

I believe I can do both myself, i am just asking for help identifying what piece/part is supposed to be where that bracket he points out at 0:47 seconds is supposed to be. If anyone can reply/identify it, much appreciated! 

car is still in very good condition other wise and is perfect, i just really need to fix these two damn puzzling codes for a peace of mind."

Motorcycle is killing batteries every two weeks.
I was riding one day and my motorcycle battery died, so I put a new one in and all was well until about 2 weeks later. The new battery had also died so I took it home and charged it but it still didn’t work. When I turn the key the dash lights up and when I hit the ignition the FI (I believe it means fuel injection) light starts blinking and the bike won’t start. But when I put another fresh battery in it the bike runs fine again. What could be the problem? My guess is the stator, but when I used a multimeter on the battery that doesn’t work, the multimeter showed a normal voltage of 13.2

Also I believe the water pump is leaking coolant into the oil so maybe the stator is shorted or something but idk"

Car manually turns, but doesn’t start.
I have a 2023 dodge challenger, I drove through a flooded street and the car hydro locked. Today I took out the spark plugs and manually turned it until no more water shot out. The only problem is the car doesn’t crank. I replaced the starter yesterday thinking that was the problem due to it just clicking once, but I may have burned the starter trying to start the car so i may be replacing it again tomorrow.

Since I can easily rotate the engine 360 degrees by hand, does it mean at very least my engine is good? Shop is charging 8k for engine swap.

I got a u0100 code so its probably electrical. In that case I will just take it to the shop"

Need battery help
I drive a 2015 Accord and seem to have wrecked my 1 year old (standard flooded) battery by abusing it with electronics. I bought a dual dash-cam system for 24hr recording because I live in NYC and I'm tired of damage while my car is parked overnight. Hooked it up via fuse tap and it rarely worked 100%, I'd often have to power it using the cigarette lighter power supply while driving or I'd get screen flickering/reboots on the camera, then switch to fuse tap power while parked and powered off. But I have a short 20-40min drive to/from work and I even though the fuse tap cuts off power when it gets low, I must've slowly killed the battery because now I get 4 dash warning lights every time I drive, and I can't get them to go away, but I stopped recording while parked for now.

AutoZone tested the battery and it passed, but ""charging"" failed even though my alternator is working fine; battery is full and reads >14v while car is running and I've never needed to jump, so I've read that probably means the battery has issues with one or more cells and even though it can start the car no problem it's having issues _with Amperage_, dishing out enough power to all the various electronics in the car.

So I've come to the conclusion (you tell me if I'm wrong) that in order to use the 24hr dash cam, I should get a higher AH battery, and probably an AGM so that it'll charge quicker on a shorter drive. But the problem I'm having shopping around is I only really see one battery that fits the bill, a Full Throttle FT75035, and I'm worried it won't fit because it's not a 51R like my Accord recommends and idk RockAuto's return policy. All other AGM's I see have maybe 5 more AH than mine and I'm not sure whether I'll run into the same issue.

Any tips? Am I on the wrong track completely and should be considering something else?"

Oil pressure light on-what should I do?
I have a 2016  Sonata with a theta engine that carries both a CarMax (Assurant) warranty and is covered by Hyundai if it experiences rod knock before 150k. Trust me I would sell the POS if I could but it’s so worthless now that I can’t afford to trade it in. I know the engine is on its way out but it’s just not *quite* bad enough for either Hyundai or Carmax to say “have a new engine!”
I have gone to SO many mechanics in the last month and it am going crazy. I had a weird loss of power happen multiple times on 4/28 and since I was about to go on a road trip that Friday I took it to a mechanic that day. Without any lights or codes they told me they couldn’t replicate the problem and to come back if it got worse. Charged me $90 for their time. We drove from Florida to Virginia without an issue, then on the way back we broke down in Georgia on 5/6. That mechanic performed testing and inspection, code is P1326. Scanned live data and said engine rod knock is present, engine is failing internally. They recommended we go to Hyundai for an engine replacement because of the knock sensor code. Hyundai took a look on 5/8 and said they wouldn’t be replacing the engine because knock wasn’t present. They said the oil level was low (has a history of oil consumption 3 quarts/thousand miles) and that doing an oil change would be the solution to our problems. I went to Take 5 on 5/19 for an oil top off, because the oil was looking low. They said I needed closer to 2 quarts than 1 quart, which I was suspicious about, but the car seemed to drive fine after. Then on 5/29 I drove to the gym and when I was at a stoplight the oil pressure light flashed on for a second, once I got all the way to their parking lot the oil pressure light stayed on I freaked tf our because I know you shouldn’t drive with that light on, so I had it towed to a mechanic. They charged me $50 for a quick inspection but basically said they wouldn’t touch it with a ten foot pole because it needs a combustion chamber cleaning, which only Hyundai has the technology to do. PS once I go to the mechanic on 5/29 the oil light was gone 🙄. Mechanic said my oil was clean and the level was good. 

Drove the car on 5/30 and it was fine. Then drove to work on 5/31 and as I parked the light lit up again. Turned the car on to go home and the light was off, drove home, and light turned on as I pulled in the driveway. I just checked and the oil is clean and at the right level. So idk what to do. None of these mechanics can diagnose a a problem to fix, but I also don’t want to drive with an oil pressure light on and somehow be held responsible for engine damage that already existed

Unless mechanics can replicate the condition, they can’t diagnose it, and it’s not happening enough that I can reliably replicate it. So what am I to do? Keep driving until the oil light stays lit up, risking damage? Continue to pay $50-100 to mechanic after mechanic after mechanic until we figure out a solution? Will the computer store these instances of low oil pressure lights and will that be used against me? "

Subaru WRX A/C system repair- refrigerant oil volume question
My 2016 WRX's compressor is done and despite this being a common issue with many Subarus, I'm having trouble finding answers to questions I have to repair it properly myself. This isn't my first rodeo with car projects, and I have done a simpler job of replacing a bad o-ring and recharging successfully before. 

The shop that diagnosed the problem evacuated the refrigerant a couple weeks ago and now I've been waiting on parts.

**My main question is, how much additional refrigerant oil (if any) should I add before charging the system? Does the new compressor have enough oil for the entire system, or should I add more to the new condenser?** I've found detailed charts for other car makes and models about oil volumes in components, but turned up nothing after searching periodically the last few weeks for my car specifically.

My planned procedure:

* Remove the old compressor, condenser, and expansion valve
* Flush the remaining system components not replaced (evaporator, lines) & dry with compressed air
* Replace the old components and o-rings with new (new OEM compressor has oil)
* Pull a vacuum & check for leaks
* Recharge per spec (I have that volume, the only detail that's been easy to find)

If there's anything missing to my plan, call me out on it please.

If I can't figure something out more definitive, is it safe to pull the vacuum and check for leaks, close it off, and take it to a shop within a couple days to recharge and decide if it needs more oil or not?

AC fan blows warm air until it gets really hot above 80F outside, irregular climate control cooling on 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe 3.3L
Vehicle is a 2017 Hyundai Santa Fe with 3.3L engine. I bought this car “used” 5 years ago. The AC seems to hesitate to turn on unless it gets really hot outside. It cools fine when outside temperature is roughly above 80 F. My system is set to automatic climate control and temperature is set at 64F for testing purposes. I have tried this first thing in the morning and last thing at night. Can’t say this is due to any kind of locking up due to AC overload. Just one steady thing.. when the outside temperature is between 70 F and 80 F, the blower fan blows air strongly but it’s not cold, as if the AC cooling does not want to kick in. The thing is this exact behavior happened last summer and under an extended warranty I have already had the AC compressor replaced because they identified it as the problem. I have checked the refrigerant level and that seems to be ok. To be on the safe side, I recently had a NEW mechanic shop do an AC service where they checked for leaks and did a vacuum pull and refill of the refrigerant. The new shop is again eager to call it an AC compressor failure and charge big money for a second time. Seems a bit unreal. Unfortunately I no longer have warranty on my original repair done last year as it has been more than 12 months. (I do have a second car of the exact same year, make and model and it does not behave this way so I know something is going on here).

Has anyone seen behavior like this from an AC system? What could be the underlying cause? Could it be something as simple as a thermostat or a sensor somewhere? Anything else that I am missing?"

NEED HELP 2017 Veloster Problem
 I am desperate here. Base model Veloster. 2017. About 3 years into having the car, I ended up almost getting stranded. I could not for the life of me get the car to go into Reverse or Drive. It happened one time and then nothing for about a year. Then I was driving and out of no where the engine just revved and I had no gas. I look down and I see the car is in Neutral. I was on the highway and doing about 60MPH. I moved the shifter to Neutral and back to Drive. It did this multiple times. No engine light, no warnings. I drive it to the local dealer. The dealer tells me the diagnostic they did lead them to believe it was the Neutral Safety Switch. The dealer wanted to charge me 3K for the fix. My husband and I looked at each other and after we talked, we decided to just bring it home without the dealer charging me an astronomical price for the fix. I just could not justify paying 3K for a $60 part and what turned out to be a 30 mins install.

I will now add that my husband is a ASE Certified mechanic but has been out of dealerships for a bit now. We weren't sure of the problem and since my car has the Dual Clutch we were both a bit hesitant to just dive in ourselves. As the cars get more and more advanced it's harder and harder to do the work yourself.

We replaced the Switch. That took about a half hour. HOWEVER --- We had a HELL of a time adjusting it. We literally sat there making VERY SMALL adjustments. We lost the Reverse and Drive multiple times. We lined the holes on the Switch as it states in the guides with the 5mm pin with the car in Neutral.....nothing was working out right. Some how by the grace of the Hyundai gods, we found the 'sweet spot' and it was good for about 2 years.....

Now here I am again.... The car WILL NOT START. I tried everything...... Somehow it started and I drove it home. Started doing research.  
From what I read the Switch needs to be passing a certain voltage and be in the Park position to start. Which all points to the Switch again. This is now the 2nd OE switch to go bad. This time I ordered and AM switch. Installed the switch. Adjusted it and seemed fine....

Now today....

SAME.... EXACT....PROBLEM.

Will not start in Park. I can drop the car to Neutral (If the shifter isn't locked) and start it there just fine. And if I SLAM the car into Park, it seems to start again.....Until it doesn't. We lined up the holes in Neutral, just like before. But it seems when I put the car in Park like normal, it won't start again. But when I slam it into park, the switch seems to move that extra 16th of an inch over clockwise and it starts again, but somehow wiggles back that 16th of an inch and won't start. We have adjusted the nut to every possible position. I either loose Reverse, Drive or both. We see the holes lined up in Neutral - think we got it and then ...NOPE.

  
We also took the plastic off the console where the shifter is just to make sure that there wasn't anything in there that was interfering with the shifter. Everything looked like it was in perfect condition.

This is where I need help! Does anyone have any guides or information on how to set the Switch and adjust it right? We followed Hyundai guides and we both cannot seem to get it. No matter what I look up, I can't find anything that has a spec. Or if anyone has any other ideas if the Switch doesn't seem to be the issue and I am heading down the wrong rabbit hole. We are at a loss. I am desperate.

There are also still no codes coming from the car. We hooked up a brand new scanner and nothing came back. HELP !!!!! And thank you! 

Also I apologize for any mechanic reading this and I am not using the right terms. "

Trashed BCM need advice
Few days ago I dropped my FIAT EGEA CROSS 2023 1.4 Fire car to the service for a small problem about a ugly sound that comes from my steering wheel lock. My car's warranty is still active so I thought it would be a ""small fix"" by the ""authorized"" service. Somehow they told me they locked out my car due to someone tempering software of my car before (which is what they claimed) and they needed to replace my BCM and ECU which they would charge me full price. 

I do not know what the hell is going on and how the situation is escalated this point but does anybody know how they could trash my BCM and couldn't fix it even though they are FIAT's own service and have all the official stuff? They even offered me they can call an ""unofficial guy""who somehow might be able to fix this because they have some additional tools that are actually illegal but ""works""?"

Can differential failure damage transmission or other parts?
I have a 2022 BMW X3 M40i and recently I did its 50k service. They advices to replace differential fluids. After I returned home there was a weird like burning smell. I took the car and they didn’t find anything suspicious. 

However few days after that and while driving on highway there was a strange noise (like you hit something) and stopped accelerating in a normal pace. I had to stop and exit the first available highway exit line. Towed car to service and they found front differential to be broken. They will replace at no charge under warranty. 

Can this lead to any other problems? Like transmission failure or anything? I drove the car like for 2 miles mostly just to be out of the highway. Photo is from the car once I towed and had the leak. "

Did the mechanic try and screw me?
Both my kids have 09 Civics and neither blowing cold air. I could see that on both cars the compressor wouldn't engage when the AC was on. Took my son's to a mechanic in town with good reviews and he said he would have a look. I mentioned that the compressor wasn't engaging.

He called a couple hours after I dropped it off. He said it was empty of refrigerant so he charged it but the compressor wouldn't engage. So he emptied the refrigerant and decided it needed a compressor. He said i owed him $100 for the refrigerant and he would install a compressor for $1100.

I thought it was a little odd that he did something he was gonna charge me $100 for without telling me, but he's got good reviews so I gave him the benefit of the doubt.

I cant afford $2200 (since I was pretty sure they both had the same problem) so I bought a compressor and installed it on my sons car. Filled it with refrigerant but the compressor still wouldn't engage.

Quickly found a YouTube video where this guy said it's very common on that generation of civics for the problem to be the relay and not the compressor at all.

So I picked up the relay at AutoZone for $12, installed it in my son's car and the compressor engaged immediately

I talked to the mechanic today and asked him if he checked the relay and he said ""for sure,the  relay was fine but there was no power to the compressor"".

I explained to him that I installed a new compressor but it wouldn't engage until I replaced the relay""

He said, ""I don't know what to tell you, I checked them both and the relay was fine but the compressor was dead"".

So it seems obvious to me that he's either lying or the compressor was bad and then the relay went bad within the 5 days between when he checked it out and when I installed the new compressor. Find it hard to believe the relay went bad in 5 days.

Since I can't return the compressor, I don't feel like going to the trouble of putting the old one back in just to see if it was fine all along, although I'm thinking it was

The new relay also fixed the issue with my daughter's car.

How to handle Dealership
Back October we started having issues with our 2016 XC90 T8 where it wouldn't start randomly and display a ""engine restart not possible"" while driving once or twice a day. I'd like to call myself a fairly competent diagnostician but after messing with the car for a while, I decided it was outside of my knowledge to repair. 

We finally bit the bullet and took it to the dealer in November when it was down below freezing and the car wouldn't start for about a week. After about a month of no news, we finally got a quote to remove the HV battery for module testing, and if failed, replace a suspect module on hv battery. Adding up to around 2.5k in labor and 700 for the module. 

We went ahead and ok'd the work and after removing the battery pack, and replacing the module, the issue remained. Then over the last 5-6 months we have been checking in person and calling multiple times per week for any sort of update. At least a few of the times we showed up, it was at least good to see the car in the formans bay with much of the interior torn out and a scope reading across multiple data lines.

It's now been 7 months with the car at the dealership, with multiple visits from a Volvo engineer and they cannot diagnose the problem. The dealer is now basically telling us we owe them $3,200 for the battery R&I with new module and they can't figure out the problem and we should continue to drive it. I understand the technician still spend time and should get paid for that, but with the potential to get stranded, it feels like a waste of money. Do we raise hell about the charge for of service, or just pay it and move on?


Tldr: Dealer can't figure out the problem after 7 months with volvo engineer support, and still want us to pay the $3,200 for diagnostics.

Volvo USA has also been little to no help and they basically blow us off every time we've emailed."

Foul play from mechanic? 2014 bmw 328i
I replaced the valve cover/ gasket on my friends bmw on 4/19 of this year. So naturally I unplugged everything, did the job, put it all back together, everything is fine. The car is driven daily and there were no complaints. FF to 5/5. They are driving to work and they send me a picture “charging system malfunction” and and bunch of shit on the dash. And I’m at work so unfortunately I’m unable to look myself, but I say “looks like alternator, but it could be a broken belt” they had the car towed to a shop and were charged 150$ for diag… broken belt. But I understand the game and that’s not my problem. They were quoted 450$ to have it replaced and I said I’d do it for them In a couple days. I change the belt, jump it, all good. On my way home they text me that the acceleration feels slow, so I just say to let it ride another couple days and I’ll check it out. Upon further inspection, the fuel rail sensor is unplugged and stuffed down way out of the way, I plug it in, problem solved. 

Before I start pointing fingers, would you assume this is foul play or is it possible I missed it while completing the valve cover job? 
I wouldn’t think it’s something I missed especially since this complaint wasn’t brought up until after it was seen for the broken belt. 

Sorry for the rant and I appreciate any feedback. "

Blew the main fuse and some fuses, now some things don't work.
Hey Guys,

So I was in a rush and forgot to label my polarity on my battery wires for a while. Forgot which one was which and they both have the same opening circumference, crossed them and blew a few fuses.

Battery is showing 11.3v or 11.5v after this situation. May have to charge the battery. Could I have damaged the alternator or ECU?

  
Problems that still persists or occurring:

* My window switches don't work, tested all the fuses under the dash. There are 2 or three where I placed new ones but I get no current to them?
* My hazard lights in my dash don't work but outside all lights work.
* My high beam light doesn't turn blue when I turn them on, still works on the outside but not in the dash.
* My cigarette lighter does not work, don't think it did when I bought it. Anyone know a fix for this?
* Side mirror motor or switch does not work, don't think it did when I bought it. Anyone know a fix for this?
* Now the battery light turns on my dash and while driving I lost my head unit light where it shows the radio stations? and some lights while I was driving? I asked Ai and it says could be a faulty alternator, slipping serpentine belt? - My belt has been squeaking since I bought it and everything else was working fine, ECU or voltage regulator issues? In these cases, I may have fried my alternator or something to do with the ECU?"

alternator not charging till a restart the car
Hello brothers , i have this weird problem that i'm stuck how to fix it , i just bought a new battery then did coding in vcds , ""my last one lasted 3 years"" ,

my problem is when i start the car i get the battery light in the dash and the alternator is not charging even if i accelerate , then if i restart the car , the alternator start charging again this is for almost a year now , and every time i get in the care i need to always do it , even if a shutdown the car for just 1 minutes , i need to start shut it then restart

\+ voltage when the alter is charging is 14.20 in both engine bay or at the battery terminals .  
\+ Sometimes when the car sit for while maybe 4/5 hours or in the morning the alternator charges at the first crank

no problem detected in vcds while alternator working , but if i checked vcds while the alternator not working i get faults like 01336 company data bus - 01320 control module climatronic j255 - 00456 control module for acces and start control j518 in the energie management module 4f0 910 181e , but i think it's normal bcs no current from alternator ?  
Other than that i have a canbus error in the engine compartment for 4 years now , checked almost every cable to no success ,so i'm only left with an old work done for a corroded cable in the drivers door interconnect cables that' i did my best to fix but not so sure if ithe cables are 100% sealed ,

so any ideas ? Before i try and buy a new alternator ,

and also can a broken wire somewhere or a maybe a bad ground connection in the chassis cause this problem, knowing that the voltage and the resistance in the battery terminals are good ?

thank you guys .

What the actual f.
2015 Cadillac ats with the 3.6l in it. 72000 miles. Service battery charging continuously comes on no matter what I do. Brand new battery brand new alternator brand new ecm and I got brand new wiring coming basically right from the ecm to the alternator. I just didn’t depin the actual connector, used rosin core solder to splice the wires together, friction taped the wires and everything. Only thing that isn’t oem is the alternator itself. I’m starting to wonder if that’s the issue but it just doesn’t make sense, the ecm fixed the problem for a while, then the wires fixed the problem for a while, but it just keeps coming back"

3SGE catastrophic engine failure - Opinions needed
End bearing on the camshaft has overheated and gone! destroying that part of the head. It's a long story but I'd really appreciate it if you guys could read it and give your opinions.

1997 Celica GT - 170,000 miles.

My main goal is to figure out if this damage was caused by me or if the garaged messed up.

Around 8 weeks ago I was driving along and timing belt slipped 3 teeth. Got her trailered to the garage, they told me that the tensioner was way out (by over a whole millimetre when they said the tolerance was 0.1mm). Sure, got a new timing belt kit and water pump, they installed it, costing me £540 ($800).

Drove car home, there was a super faint burning smell, I thought it was rubber (obviously turned out to be metal). There was no smell at all when the timing belt went the first time. 

Drove the car for another two days, doing about 10 miles of city driving total so no harsh driving.

Took the car for a drive to the beach and around the area with a friend, was driving a bit harder but not anything crazy, after about 15 miles worth of driving, after a hill (where I was using more throttle), the smell came back and only got stronger from there, I wasn't sure if it was just burnt clutch from a bad shift, to be on the safe side, I slowed down to 20mph and was very gentle. About 500M later bang, the timing belt had slipped, I could tell immediately.

Had to get the car trailered back to the garage. I emailed them what happened and they took a look.

Originally they got a new belt, put it on after a few weeks of waiting, and they told me it slipped again after letting the car run for a few minutes.

Another week goes by and I call up to see what is going on (they are very bad at updating me). they tell me that one of the parts for the timing belt (I think one of the gears) has a bad thread and needs a helicoil, they told me that its probably from the previous owner (This is where I'm wondering if it was installed incorrectly).

They do that (They haven't charged me for any of these extra repairs so far). and test it. FINALLY, they call me and tell me that the belt still slipped, they tell me to come in and have a look.

I go to the garage and the rocker cover is off, the pictures above are from that occasion. 

Their story: It looks like there hasn't been oil getting to it for a while, the rocker cover also looks like its been resealed, some of the sealant could've broken off and clogged one of the oil paths or it could've just been clogged over time, causing it to fail, which is also why the helicoil was needed and the tensioner was out of whack.

My opinion (I haven't yet said this directly to them): I have done over 2,000 miles since the rocker cover was re-sealed, even if sealant was loose, it would have been trapped in the oil filter or stuck in the sump before it had a chance to make its way back up and block a line. Also, I have never heard of oil paths/lines being blocked on this car before. 

Why are there no burn marks on any other part of the camshaft/area. Its only that one single component that has any kind of wear (pictures). I also have only just done an oil change just 2,000 miles ago too with high quality Castrol Edge, as well as multiple 2.5 hours journeys. 

My belief is that they did a bad repair the first time which has caused this. 

Any thoughts, opinions, agree or disagree, anything will help as I'm just so distraught from all of these problems with my poor Celica :(

Thanks for reading if you've got this far!"

Battery not charging advice
Hey guys,

My car has done 145000kms it’s a 2002 BMW 330i and I believe is on the original alternator from 2002. Suddenly one night my partner and I started the car to drive home and the battery light was on. That light also kept going on and off throughout the drive until finally toward the very final few minutes some more lights on the dash came on and the lights went off. Managed to get home safely. Charged the battery myself and put it back in and it worked the next day no problem but still the battery light came on. For a while the battery light would go off anytime I accelerated harder however it’s been a couple of weeks and it is just always on now. ( I know I should of fixed it sooner but I just don’t have the money right now) so we have been getting by just by fully charging the battery and keeping our drives short, seems to be okay but I think it’s taken a toll on my battery itself.
My boot lights are always dimming and brightening again over and over again. It has also died on me once just as I got to the garage and sputtered

Lately I’ve been hearing a whirring kind of noise, somewhat similar to a very faint supercharger whine type of sound at certain RPMS.

I’ve tested the voltage coming into the battery and it basically isn’t charging at all when the car is on which I already knew would be the case. Anyways just looking for some advice as to if it’s the alternator or the voltage regulator… hoping for a cheaper fix but expecting it to be the alternator

Thanks in advance"

Was I bamboozled by a local mechanic? 2009 Toyota rav4
Hi, 

Sorry if this is confusing. I'm normally level headed but I am so livid right now. I think I got bamboozled. My car (2009 Toyota RAV4) was acting funny three weeks ago on the highway and we towed it to our usual mechanic. He wasn't available for a few weeks so the mechanic next door offered to take a look as he works on weekends, said he'd give it a quick turn around.

He informed me that it was something to do with the gear shift. He spent a few days working on it and it was fixed. Drove it out the next day. Car started shaking and did not feel safe to drive. Opened up the hood and saw the transmission smoking. I asked him to tow it as I never would have driven it knowing that this type of issue was wrong. He said he would tow it for $50 and I was livid he'd still charge for his mistake, so I used someone else.

Brought it back thinking he'd fix the original issue that he ""fixed"". Promised to check it out, and informed me a few days later it was the transmission and it would be around $3200 all in. I was dumb and accepted thinking that would be it. I can't afford a new car right now.

Long story short, false turn around dates, three week delay, promised he'd send me quotes over text but I never received anything. Allegedly said he called me but he never did. When I called about two weeks into this he said he did all the work only to learn he was given the wrong transmission so there's another week delay.

When I finally picked up my car, he said for the unexpected work and parts, it's now going to be $4500. I was livid. Shouldn't mechanics check with the customer before proceeding? I fought for it to go down but most he would go is $3800, not including the previous $421 that I already paid him for the other problem.

I received it yesterday and drove it, the car is still shaking at times and it's leaking oil now. I am ignorant in cars but I know it's unsafe. I really don't want to bring it back but I want him to fix what he didn't fix properly free of charge. He says he can't look at it for another three days, and I can't afford to Lyft, Uber and bus me and my family around for another week. This will bring us to almost a month.

My question is:

At this point I wish I had just scrapped it and got a new car. What should I do now? 

Was anything he did even proper? I know I should have went to another mechanic the other time, but now I'm out $3800 + $421 and I just want him to either fix what he did wrong or to refund me all of my money. I've never had to deal with a mechanic before so I am extremely stressed with how this whole thing was managed. I've probably spent at least $400 alone these past few weeks cabbing my family and I to and from work and school. 

Should I ask for a refund? Do I even bring it out anymore? Do I swallow the loss and just try shopping for a new car?

No crank, varying limited to no power no start. 2015 Ford Focus
Hello, Thanks for your time.

2015 Ford Focus. Started a few days ago where drove all day turning car off and on then a no power (no lights at all) no crank. Got it started after charging with cables for 20 minutes, drove it home, let sit in driveway turned on for 20 minutes, came out and car was off again no power no crank. Jumped it again and then it was totally fine and issue free for 4 days.

Last night no power no start. Came back two hours later, started totally fine. (Battery voltage looked good before trying to start, turned car on and voltage went up a bit so i'm assuming alternator is fine). 

Today, started and drove 3 different times. Then a no power no crank, maybe digitial speedometer light came on. Stared at the engine bay for 20 minutes,  tried again, started no problem (again battery voltage looked good the whole time).

Drove it to autozone, now no crank varying lights on each attempt one (and only) time a SYSTEM START ERROR light showed (video attached). Also in that video I open the door the show lights react to door opening (last night and previously of didn't even do that)  After this video I tried a few times each time something different - no lights at all, sometimes speedometer light, one time the message ""Transmission not in park"" very briefly came up before going to no power. It's definitely in park, disengaged shift lock while no power to put it on neutral and back to park just to make sure.

This is a bit out of my league but it seems like an electrical issue instead of a battery or alternator issue. Possibly bad wiring somewhere? Looking for direction on how to do preliminary diagnosis before taking it to a shop. No noticable corrosion on battery terminals and they feel snug. 

Thanks again "

Can a Mechanic overcharge you after you arrive.
So I had a mechanic work on my axle. Mind you, he’s a backyard mechanic but he do a great job. Recently he fixed my axle. I dropped my car off the night before. Spoke with him the following morning about the work and he advised it would be completed by 5pm. He is also aware that I go to school and get out at 10 so I wouldn’t be about to pick it up at 5. It would have to be after 10pm. He calls me at 8pm. Since I was at school I couldn’t answer. He texts me ’’Cv axle stuck in the transmission I’m going to have to bring in help to get it out I’m paying him”. I said ‘ok’. After 10:30pm he sends me pics of the broken axle. Then calls me and advised the work won’t be done until 1am. He also stated the guy he called to help him pull the axle out of the transmission (supposedly)charged him $150. I told him I was unaware of the issue.
Luckily he called me at 12 to advise me it’s ready. I pull up, we talk about the car, everything is good. I confirmed the original price with him which is $175. And confirmed that I’m not paying anything more. He proceeds to say “ we good I’m not gonna hit you over the head like that. I’m not that guy” and walks away. (side note I was also gonna give him a nice tip just because I personally know him and I know he do a good job. And plus he was going out of town. Who wouldn’t like extra money going out of town?) I turn around and proceeds to talk to my boyfriend, happy that my car is fixed, and just ready to go back home and relax. Mind you it’s after 12am. As he walks back up, I send the $175 via cashapp. Idk if something fell on his head when he walked away or if he tripped and knocked some screws loose upstairs. When he comes back after I send the money, he look at me and said that’ll be $325. And I looked at him. He looked at me. I looked at him. 🌚🌝 
I proceed to tell him I don’t have that and I wasn’t aware of the problem. And he said he didn’t sign up for this. 

Fun fact prior to this service, he fixed my engine mounts and struts and that’s when I was advised the axle needs to be replaced. So if that’s the case how come you didn’t see that before? Why wasn’t the price brought up as my responsibility to pay before? 
And then he was saying everything to reassure me I’m not paying anything extra. Just to turn around and charge me way more than we talked about. I also feel that if you didn’t have to proper tools to complete the job and you have to get someone else to do it, I shouldn’t be responsible for it. And any additional payment should’ve been advised before continuing the work. 
I did pay him $200 instead of the $150 and I don’t feel I I should pay him $325. I think he tryna milk me.

SORRY THIS IS LONG BUT I NEED HELPPP!

2003 Volkswagen Jetta Power Issue
\[SOLVED\]  
  
2003 VW Jetta Wolfsburg Edition  
1.8L Engine (Turbo)  
97,100 miles

Issue:

I've occasionally had the power drop out for a second (maybe one in 10 drives). The dash blinks out, sometimes long enough to reset the digital clock on the dash. All the notification lights blink on during this second, and I get the standard single beep indictator. The car jerks during this second as well, similar to getting bumped into at a traffic light (not like a hesitation).

After the second has passed, everything goes back to normal (no indicator lights remain on). Most of the time this happens while driving under 30 mph in the first few minutes after the car has sat overnight. It has happened twice on the highway after driving 10-15 miles, so not sure if there's a pattern with speed or engine activity.

In addition I have only had this happen once during wet weather, and it completely shut the engine off, and then went into auxillary mode since the key was still in the ignition -- but it was the only time there was no jerking. Fortunately I had just parked, but the gear was still in Drive mode when it happened. In this situation I immediately tried to restart it and it worked, still in Drive mode. I placed it in Park, and had no issues driving back home ten minutes later (under 1 mile).

\[UPDATE:  It's raining hard right now, so I ran to the store (1.5 mile round trip) and had no issues. Water might not be a factor.\]

Mechanic garage:

Brought it to a local mechanic. He tried to replicate the issue to no avail (not sure why he needed to replicate?). He did say he checked all major electrical connections, and all were tight. The battery is only a year old, the nodes and cables are all clean as they are new. He ran a diagnostic via the car's computer and no alerts came up. He said the alternator was working fine as well.

Question:

1. Could this be the computer itself malfunctioning, throwing false readings or glitching out? The car is 22 years old, so I imagine its lifespan must be nearing its end.
2. What other possibilities may contribute to this?

For example, this car has a duo-radiator fan. When I first turn on the car it revs high for about 15 seconds. Within a few blocks it revs again for maybe 5 seconds. After that it doesn't rev high at all, as the engine is ""warmed up"", and I have no engine temperature issues. This has not been looked at, as I was quoted a repair cost and had been saving money to bring it in when the electrical issue grabbed my attention. Could this fan be causing a short, or could the fan issue be a result of the computer not functioning properly -- perhaps meaning the computer is causing both issues?

Thank you for any help, advice, and/or feedback. I will provide any additional information I can to help you isolate the problem. I'd like to get input before bringing it in to the local VW dealership, as their garage has very bad reviews -- but the average general car mechanics all seem to not know what to do next (I called many shops who refused to work on this issue).

\[SOLUTION\]

Corroded ground, cleaned it up -- no more electrical issues. This was literally under the battery. Shops couldn't figure it out, this sub had no responses...   
  
Took a few minutes to resolve. Always check the simple solutions first, and don't blindly trust shops. At least they didn't charge me, only wasted my time. Cheers."

Take car to mechanic or dealership for (possible) extended warranty issue?
I have a 2021 honda insight and there is a 10 year extended warranty with no mileage limit for factory condensors. My A/C has been weak for the past 1.5-2 years and now its useless. Its somewhat cool or neutral on the passenger side and is warm on the driver side. My RPMs go up when i turn my A/C up. The air blows strong. Replaced both filters. Not too much changed with that. 

My question is do i take it straight to the dealership, where the diagnostic fee would most likely be waived if its the condensor, or go to an individual mechanic to diagnose the issue? I feel like im just gambling on whether its the condensor or not to get the best price, if its not, Honda would likely charge a lot more than anyone else to fix that said problem. So is there more i can do to find that out on my own? Does this sound like a condenser issue?"

BMW overheating, water pump missing?
2014 BMW 535i (F10, N55 engine) car is in excellent condition and reliable to the max until 3 days ago when the car started overheating.  Checked coolant level, was very minimal low, just below the min level, I topped it off and drove again with no issues. I even tried max AC in hot weather and aggressive driving, still no overheating issues, I drove for another day and no issues. 

3rd day, today, again started overheating while driving on the freeway. No check engine lights, but decided to scan it and it gave me code 20A909 (water pump missing). I had the car towed home and ordered a new water pump and thermostat which will arrive tomorrow. 

I wanted to start taking the old pump off tonight but though to test it again, code is gone. And the water pump is working (the coolant is flowing in the reservoir as the pump circulates the coolant) I checked the pump connection and all are intact and nothing loose. I drove the car and no overheating.

The question is, is this the pump acting up intermittently going out? Or is this an electrical issue? 

The car has 140k miles and I am not sure if the pump has ever been replaced but I can say that I owned the car for the last 7 years and 80k miles and I have never had it replaced. I’m tempted to just replace the pump and thermostat considering it’s time for them to go out anyways. But I am not sure if there is an undiagnosed electrical issue that I should be looking more into."

Octavia 4 RS - weird noise during specific turns
Octavia 4 RS - 2021, 2.0 TSI, 180kw. Car's done almost 80,000km. I'm the 2nd owner, bought it 6 weeks ago and just noticed this.

So far I've done wheel alignment. Changed oil in diff, trans. Replaced front suspension arms and bushings, done wheel alignment again.

I regularly do 300km trips on bendy roads just fine with no weird noises but close to my home there are these two apparently VERY specific turns where the car makes this sound almost every time. It's always a sharp left turn at the end of a town (=accelerating). So when all the weight shifts to the right side of the car. I am able to somewhat reliably replicate this by quickly turning the steering wheel right-left by about 90 degrees while moving, so again causing weight to rapidly shift to one side.

At first I thought it sounded like shifting without applying clutch properly but it's DSG and it happens in manual mode as well when the car is NOT shifting gears. It sounds like some rotating part touching something else, usually the sound is a much ""shorter"" burst but this time I managed to capture it more pronounced and hopefully easier to identify for someone who's had to deal with this before.

19 inch wheels but I couldn't find any sign of rubbing (and it doesn't really sound like that either to me).

  
Last thing that comes to mind is transmission mount/bushing/whatever you call it but I'd like to not replace 25 expensive parts just for it to be caused by the 26th if at all possible :)"

Engine seized shortly after valve cover gasket replacement – BMW X5 E70 40d (N57) – garage denies fault but can’t exclude it
Hi everyone,

I’m looking for advice and second opinions about a serious issue with my 2012 BMW X5 E70 40d (N57 engine, approx. 255,000 km).

Here’s what happened:

* **June 23:** I brought the vehicle to my local garage for a **routine service and visual inspection**
* During that check, they discovered an **engine oil leak** and diagnosed a **leaking valve cover gasket**
* They recommended replacing the gasket and said it was necessary to prevent further issues
* **June 24, around 4 PM:** I picked up the vehicle after the gasket was replaced
* **Same day, around 5:40 PM:** I drove to a job. Roughly 20 minutes later, the engine suddenly **cut out while driving**. It wouldn’t restart
* The car was towed back to the same garage that night
* **June 27:** The garage informed me the **engine is seized**. They used an endoscope and found **vertical scoring** in 3 cylinders

When I asked if it could be their fault, they told me:

>“We checked our work and found no mistake, but we also can’t 100% rule out that something went wrong. These things can happen.”

They also said that if they report it to their insurance, it will likely trigger a detailed forensic analysis, including engine disassembly – which could be costly and not covered, especially given that:

* A replacement engine would cost around  **USD 11,200–16,800**
* The market value of the car is around **USD 11,200**
* (Converted Currencies from my local prices)

So now I’m stuck. There’s no clear admission of fault, but the **timing is extremely suspicious** – the engine failed less than two hours after leaving the workshop. Prior to that, the car drove fine.

I’m working with my legal insurance, but I’d really appreciate input from this community:

* Can **improper handling during valve cover gasket replacement** lead to engine seizure? (e.g., debris, improper torque, disconnected hoses?)
* Would the **scoring in cylinders** be a sign of pre-existing damage? Or could it really happen in just 20 minutes of driving?
* What would you do in my place?

Thanks in advance for any insights. 

Just for context: I do have a basic understanding of car mechanics, but I’m definitely not an expert. I’ve been to this workshop several times in the past – they’re usually very reliable and do good work. That’s also why I’m not jumping to conclusions, but trying to understand what might have happened here from different perspectives. Any insights or suggestions are greatly appreciated!"

No air filter!!!! Now what...
So my sister just purchased a used vehicle, a 2015 Toyota Sienna, approximately 220,000km. When I was giving it a look over (after the purchase), I was surprised to find out that there was no air filter in the air filter box. I am unsure of how long the previous owner had driven like this...

However, I do know that it was driven long enough that some dust would have gotten into the engine.
When I wipe my finger on an area that should be clean, you can see a dust buildup (see image).

How much damage do you think this could cause to the engine? She wanted to purchase a Toyota for the known reliability, but I'm concerned that isn't going to be the case anymore.

One last piece of information, the previous owner had changed the oil before selling. So it obviously looks clean.

I'm thinking about suggesting her drive it a bit for now and later do an oil analysis.

But, in the meantime. Are there any sort of tests that I can do to check the condition of the engine easily? Something easy like pulling a spark plug and looking at the cylinder walls?

Thoughts?"

2019 Cadillac CTS 3.6L AWD Condition Question
Hello,

I am currently eyeing the subject line vehicle. It has 26000 miles. It has not yet posted the listed price so that is tbd.

The condition of the car is clean as far as I can tell.

The carfax suggests routine maintenance and a clean title along with a couple of concerns possibly.

There was a trans fluid change at about 22k miles and about 2000 miles later there was a torque converter replacement.

My understanding is that these 8 speed transmissions had some issues and the TSB required a change in the trans fluid with the possibility of a torque converter change if there’s no improvement I believe.

I am wondering how concerning this may be. Or if perhaps you may even view this work as a potential positive being that it was required by the TSB. As well, I would like to know what the outlook for these transmissions are long term post fluid change and tc replacement.

Additionally, I am also wondering what everyone’s opinion is on the reliability/value of 2.0t vs the 3.6 for the CTS from 2017-2019. If I am not mistaken there were some issues with the earlier 3.6L. But by 2014 these issues were non existent from design changes.

With having said that, I have a preference for the NA engine as I believe it may be a more reliable platform and it does not require higher octane fuel. But input on this subject as well would be greatly appreciated.

Thanks."

2018 Chevrolet Traverse
I have a 2018 traverse lt awd that I got last September with 75k on it. It now has 80k. I got it certified preowned thru a local dealership.

I am having multiple issues and seeing if you guys can be of any assistance.

First: transmission is starting to “slip” at moderate acceleration (on ramp, passing, etc) in between gears. I can’t tell which gear it is maybe 3-4 but when it upshifts it almost goes into neutral. If I let off the pedal it finally shifts. If I don’t let off it revs high shudders and SLAMS into gear. So I can assume this is the telltale sign of the 9t65 transmission failing. My question to anyone here that has experienced it is does changing the fluid extend the life? I’m worried my dealership will try that route first before warrantying it. Second question is, how long did you have to wait for a reman?

Second: it is sometimes getting stuck in park. Like I can’t shift it for a few minutes. I am wondering if this is related or is it a battery voltage issue? After cranking the battery is 12.3 and when it starts charging it goes to 13.7. I noticed inconsistently it seems to let me shift once it starts charging. Sounds like a BCM issue ?

Conveniently all of this started happening this month, the same month as my wife getting diagnosed with breast cancer. Having a reliable vehicle is very important right now. The dealership is giving me the run around for a loaner. I just don’t want to be stranded on the side of the road on the way to the hospital or home from work if something comes up. Really a bad timing thing. This thing is causing extra unnecessary headaches. 

Thank you so much in advance for any information you have."

Driver and Passenger Window Switches Don't Work Reliably
2011 Grand Caravan Mainstreet with 220k

Like the title says, the door window switches haven't worked for years and I've been poking them on and off for that amount of time. I know its lazy but I'd been managing to keep the driver's switch working by smacking it once or twice and that would get the window moving. Since then I've swapped the TIPM (for an unrelated issue) and individual door switches with no appreciable changes.

I'd read before that sometimes it's a pinched wire in the door harness and there's a contact point while swinging the door that will allow the switch to work. I've checked and my issue isn't that simple.

Most recently the driver's window regulator failed and I looked at the harness while I had the door apart and it appeared in good condition. Short of banging my head against wiring diagrams and chasing individual wires, is there anything obvious that I'm missing? Thanks

Could an oil filter leak lead to valve cover leaks, O2 sensor issues, and internal engine damage?
**I**'m hoping for insight from mechanics or anyone with real-world experience with engine oil starvation.

I have a 2021 Jeep Gladiator (3.6L Pentastar V6). About a week ago, I had an oil change performed by a national chain. The day after the service, I unknowingly drove \~30 miles with little to no oil in the engine due to a **damaged or improperly installed oil filter gasket**, which caused the oil to leak out overnight.

Since then, the engine has shown the following symptoms:

* Rough idle and shaking
* Hesitation under acceleration
* Check engine light with codes: **P0300**, **P0171**, **P2096**
* Dealer found **oil intrusion on the downstream O2 sensor**
* Dealer also found **oil leaking from both valve cover gaskets**

The shop’s insurance adjuster denied my claim, saying that the oil filter is located far from the valve covers and O2 sensor and therefore the oil filter gasket failure couldn't have caused the issues I’m seeing now.

But to me, this doesn't address the **larger issue of oil starvation**. I'm trying to understand if it's reasonable to believe that running the engine nearly dry for \~30 miles could:

1. Cause excessive internal heat and pressure, damaging **valve cover gaskets** (or causing them to leak shortly after)
2. Cause oil to be **forced onto the downstream O2 sensor**
3. Cause **valvetrain or bottom-end engine damage**, potentially leading to the misfires and lean fuel condition
4. Lead to **long-term engine reliability issues** even if it still runs for now

Can anyone help explain whether this kind of damage progression makes sense? What internal damage would you expect after 30 miles with little/no oil? Would anyone be willing to write me a letter as an expert explaining the cause and effect and damage progression I'm experiencing? Any references or experience would be appreciated—I'm trying to advocate for proper diagnosis and repair through the insurance claim.

Thanks in advance."

Can I ask the shop for a refund on work done?
I bought a used car and day after driving it the check engine light comes on. I take it to the shop for them to do a comprehensive inspection on the vehicle. They send me a list of repairs to have the car in good working .Which I agree since I needed the car to be in good working order and reliable. These repairs cost about 6k with 3 year warranty. 

A day after getting it back check engine line comes back, I run a diagnostic and get cylinder misfiring,  I take it back to the shop. They said car is having trouble starting from a cold start. They replace EV vavlve and purge valve at no cost to me. They said the car keeps having cold start but should be fine after the new repairs.

I get the car back and a day later issues starting the car and same misfiring code. I take it back to the shop and now I am told that the head gasket needs to be replaced after they found coolant in one of the cylinders head.

Now I am extremely frustrated. Is this head gasket issue something they could have caught in their initial inspection? I wouldn't have agreed to sink in 6k of repairs into a vehicle with head gasket issue. I'm not that mechanically sound but a head gasket issue is major. They are telling me they will split the cost of fixing the head gasket issue which won't pay more than 2.5k

Am I in a position to ask for a full refund of the initial repairs or for them to cover the full cost of the head gasket repair?

where to take my cadillac?
hello all! seeking some mechanic advice on my car. i drive my mom's old 2012 cadillac CTS, has nearly 200k miles on it so i know it's not in amazing shape, but i know nothing about cars. 
Recently my car had an oil leak suddenly, barely drove home  and refused to start. It was making a loud cyclical sound and smoking in the engine- again, very suddenly, drove fine to the movies that night then acted up coming home. I had to tow it to a Pepboys the next day when it wouldn't start, and they've now told me this: It's apparently more than the oil leak. they cannot figure out what's wrong with the engine, all they know is there's also an oil leak to be repaired. Quoted me around 2k then called today to say it has to be taken to a Cadillac dealer to be fixed instead, as they cannot diagnose the engine. My question is, should I have my insurance tow straight to a dealer, or should I try another mechanic? Is Pepboys reliable? I've never had to deal with repairs on a more luxury car before and this has not been fun. Hoping someone can advise me on where to have my car taken to be looked at and hopefully solved.

Killswitch or Immobilizer options
I’m looking to install a kill switch or immobilizer in my 2014 Toyota. Unfortunately, a lot of push-start cars have been getting stolen in my area, and mine was recently broken into as well.

I’m considering a remote-controlled relay that cuts off the ignition or fuel system until activated with a key fob or remote. I found a product on AliExpress that replaces the starter fuse in the fuse box, but I’m unsure if it’s reliable or safe to use.

I’m looking for better alternatives, ideally something more secure but not as pricey as the Ghost 2 system. At around $500, it doesn’t seem worth it for a car valued under $15,000. Are there any effective and affordable solutions out there that you’d recommend?"

2015 IS250 AWD and 2005 Corolla LE || keep or not?
I have two cars currently:

recently bought a 2015 IS250 AWD 200k kms on it paying $800 every month ( insurance + payments )

2005 Corolla LE 314k kms on it paying $250 a month ( insurance + no payments )

Corolla I have driven all over Ontario, reliable and of course cheap. Lexus I just bought, hopefully reliable but not cheap ofc.

They both drive fine. I now daily my Corolla to work, month 3k kms, and Lexus occasionally when I go out.

I feel Lexus is a mistake / waste of money since I use the Corolla for most of the time and the Lexus is just sitting.

I'm not sure about selling the corolla and daily ing the Lexus since everything about the car is 3x expensive.

Keeping both cars and dailying the corolla is same as dailying the Lexus considering the premium fuel and V6 engine.

Lexus is fun but is stretching my budget and playing with my peace of mind.

I was wondering what you guys think of my situation and how to be at peace with it or get it sorted out?"

2011 Nissan Sentra with over 300,000 km Worth Fixing ?
Hey folks,
I drive a 2011 Nissan Sentra with over 300,000 km on it. Lately, it’s been struggling to go past 100 km/h and feels like it’s losing power at highway speeds.

A friend scanned it with a Bluetooth OBD reader and pulled a few codes

Other than the current issue, the car is fantastic on gas and generally drives well. However, I’ve got 3–4 warning lights on the dash.

My main question:

Is it worth fixing this car, or should I just sell it for whatever I can get and buy something like a used Corolla or Civic (ideally for less than the repair cost)?

I drive a lot and rely heavily on my car, so reliability is a big deal.
Any ballpark estimate on what repairs might cost?

Thanks in advance!

[Help] Audi Q5 2011 — Multiple Brake/ABS/Start Issues After $5K in Repairs — Still Not Fixed (DMV Area)
Hi everyone,
I’m hoping someone here can help guide me. I have a 2011 Audi Q5 and I’ve been having serious issues lately, and I’m honestly at a loss.
Problems:
	•	The car sometimes completely shuts off or becomes unresponsive after braking, like when I stop at a red light.
	•	The RPM drops to zero, and it won’t go unless I turn the car off and on again — but even that doesn’t always work.
	•	Dashboard lights on:
	•	Brake malfunction
	•	Brake warning light
	•	ABS
	•	Car sliding/traction control
	•	It also sometimes won’t start at all — I turn the key, it makes the cranking noise like it’s about to start, but it doesn’t actually start.

What’s Been Done (Already Spent $5000+):
	•	New battery
	•	Brake replacement
	•	Oil + oil filter change
	•	Vacuum cleaned
	•	Fuel injectors cleaned

Now the same shop is telling me the transmission or the cooler is completely gone, and it’ll cost $3000 more. But the original problem is still happening, and I’m starting to feel like I’m being taken advantage of.
My Concerns:
	•	Could this really be a transmission issue?
	•	Could the combination of warning lights and stalling be more related to electrical problems or ABS module failure?
	•	Is it even safe to drive like this?
	•	I’m a girl living alone here in the DMV (DC/Maryland/Virginia) area, and I don’t have family or friends nearby to help me out. I just want someone honest to tell me what’s really wrong.

Has anyone dealt with something similar?
Should I take it to the dealership? A different mechanic? Is it worth fixing at this point?
Any advice or recommendation for a reliable mechanic in the DMV would be truly appreciated.

Thank you so much in advance 🙏

What’s the best OBD2 scanner for the money in 2025? Looking for pro-level DIY tool!
I am looking to buy a solid OBD2 scanner that hits the sweet spot between **price and performance**. I am not a full-time mechanic, but I do a lot of my own repairs and help friends out with diagnostics. So I do say I am a Pro-level DIYer — and I want something **more advanced than just reading/clearing codes.**

Here’s what I’m looking for:

* Full system diagnostics (not just engine codes)
* Live data & freeze frame
* Bi-directional control would be awesome
* Good compatibility with most car brands
* Budget: Ideally under $500 (but willing to stretch for long-term value)

From what I’ve seen so far:

* **Launch CRP919X** looks solid
* [Autel MK808S](https://bestobd2scanners.com/autel/mk808s-review/) seems popular (Edit: Bought this scanner)
* **XTOOL D7** gets mentioned a lot too

Anyone here have **real-world experience** with these? Or any better alternatives in 2025 that I should look at?

Also I don’t care about fancy cases or touchscreens if the tool itself is reliable, accurate, and gets the job done.

Help! No mechanic can diagnose my AC issue...

Hi everyone,
I'm really hoping someone can help me figure out what's going on with my 2012 RAV4 A/C.

Issue:
The A/C blows cold only when it’s not super hot outside. On days in the 90s+ or high humidity, especially after sitting in direct sun, it either never gets cold or starts cold and then blows warm, particularly on longer drives. Sometimes it will get cold again after turning the car off and back on, but not reliably.

Timeline & What’s Been Done:

Last summer: A/C kept cutting out in heat. A mobile mechanic said it was a wiring or electric issue and ""fixed"" it. It worked fine for about a month, then reverted to the same issue. He ghosted me after that.

This summer:

Took it to a shop. They said it was overcharged with Freon, so they evacuated and refilled to correct levels.

Worked fine for a few days, but once a heat wave hit, same issue returned—though slightly less severe. I think it may have been part of the issue but definitely not the full story.

After 15 min into my  45-minute drive in 100°F heat, it blew warm air again halfway through the trip and didn’t recover.

Recent attempt:

Another mechanic said the system was working fine... but their shop is shaded. I explained it mainly happens during long drives in intense heat which is when I need it to work the most. 

I drove it to work and it failed right before I got there, but on the return trip back to the mechanic, it didn’t fail. However, it didn't blow cold, just...not warm. The temp in the car was still warm and uncomfortable inside admist horrible heat. 

Other Notes:

Airflow is fine—blower works great. It's the temperature that’s inconsistent.

Mechanic suspects it might be the compressor but hes not 100% sure so that’s a $1,200–$1,500 gamble without confirmation.

I don’t want to be stuck in a hot car during my long commute with no A/C in 100° weather. I'm playing roulette with my A/C daily and I can't afford to be stuck in standstill traffic at the peak of summer in a hot box. I also have a little one to consider. 

What would you do in my situation? Any ideas or similar experiences? I’m stuck.

**UPDATE**
I went to pick up my car and figured I would just have to bring it back during a moment when it wasn't working so he could diagnose it correctly. Fortunately the universe was on my side yesterday because as soon as I got on the highway it started blowing from cold air to warm air so I swung the car around and drove back to the mechanic. He confirmed it blowing warm air and did his thing and looked at a few options it could be coming from and he said that sadly it is the compressor and he's surprised that was running at all. So I guess I have my answer! Thank you also much this was super insightful to learn about all of the different things that could impact an air conditioning I had no idea!"

Any Volvo/Land Rover techs who can speak to the reliability of the LR2 would be greatly appreciated! 
(BTW I'm primarily look at the LR2 over the XC90 primarily because I think the LR2 looks nicer, if it's more of an issue than it's worth I'll probably keep looking at the XC90)"

How to make the most out of my Audi for now with an extremely low budget?
2009 Audi A4 2.0T, base model, not the Quattro. 149k miles. 4-cyl 2L turbo. 

**TL;DR** I drive an unforgiving vehicle, I don't have a lot of money, and I'm planning on selling it and getting a better vehicle when I can. Any tips on taking care of it for as long as I can until I can afford to let it go (besides basic maintenance and such)? 

I don't want to hear anything about it being a dumb car for me in my current situation, trust me, I'm fully aware. I have a love-hate relationship with this thing. I'm not gonna get into it but this car kinda fell into my lap and I didn't really have a choice. 

I'm a very broke college student, currently doing anything I can to save up enough money to get rid of it and get a more reliable/affordable vehicle. I got it March 2024, and it was great to me, especially since at the time I had been driving a gas-guzzling 2003 F-150 that had various issues in itself (plus I live in a city that's really dense and annoying to navigate in a bigger vehicle for me). It is worth mentioning that due to my situation at the time, I wasn't driving very much, so I wasn't having to refill gas or do maintenance super often. 

Well, 2025 comes around, my life situation changes quite drastically and I'm now required to drive a lot more. I now drive a total of about an hour daily, Monday through Friday (and sometimes visiting family across town - that's 2 extra hours of driving on those days), and my Audi decided it doesn't like that; I've had to replace the oil cooler, coolant tank, the hose that runs from the coolant tank to the radiator, serpentine belt, alternator, 2 wheels, ABS sensor, spark plugs and ignition coils, as well as basic stuff like a tail light, fluids, wiper blades, leaks wiper fluid that I haven't fixed, etc. and it's been towed, like, 3 or 4 times by now. A few of those things had to be fixed by a mechanic and most of them I've fixed myself, but even doing it myself, it's really expensive. 

As mentioned before, I'm going to sell it, but I'm trying to hold out as long as possible (as well as finding a different job to reduce commute time) so I can save up as much money as I can to buy a better vehicle that's cheaper to maintain and won't break all the time. I still want to take care of my car and appreciate it but I mainly just don't want it to have any more issues until I sell it. How can I make the most out of my car and make sure it's being cared for and runs without issues until it's time to move on, aside from obviously basic maintenance and whatnot?"

Best place to buy a transmission?
I have a 2000 xterra 3.3 4wd that I currently would like to turn into an offroad/travel build. I am limited to basically keeping it stock because I am a college student. I cant afford to buy the most outrageous upgrades. Just enough to last me a few years, have some decent reliability, and primarily use as a travel vehicle.

Anyways, I have heard that going reman is not always the best as they just pull from low mileage wrecks. and Im not sure which site has the best bang for it buck/ trust worthiness. or just buy a salvage car and pull the transmission myself.

[Help needed] Voltage regulator failure? Concerning symptoms on 2012 ER-6f (Ninja 650R)
\[Help needed\] Voltage regulator failure? Concerning symptoms on 2012 ER-6f (Ninja 650R)

Hi everyone,

I'm looking for feedback from people who’ve experienced similar issues on their 2012 Kawasaki ER-6f (also known as the Ninja 650R in some regions).

Here are the symptoms I’ve noticed recently:

\- Battery seems OK (tested with a multimeter, holds its charge)

\- Headlights were fine until recently, but now they start flickering (mainly when the engine is running)

\- While riding on the highway, the battery warning light came on, then turned off when RPM dropped

\- Slight idle instability (hard to notice precisely)

\- There was a starter relay issue in the past (not sure if related)

I started looking into the voltage regulator, and it seems like it’s a shunt-type regulator that runs very hot (up to 140°C), especially at high RPM and low speed. I’ve heard about MOSFET alternatives like the FH020AA, which are supposed to be more reliable and run cooler. I also read that the thermal paste in the regulator can degrade over time, making the issue worse.

Here’s what I’m looking for:

\- Confirmation of compatible MOSFET regulator models for a 2012 ER-6f (FH020AA? Others?)

\- Advice or tutorials specific to this bike for accessing and replacing the regulator

\- Is there a plug & play conversion kit for this bike, or do I need to redo the connectors manually?

\- Should I also check/replace the stator while I’m at it?

\- Feedback on what changed after replacement (stable voltage? issue gone?)

Thanks in advance for any tips or feedback! 🙏















  
So i did it, wasnt to complicated (took 3hrs)   
You should watch a video how to get off platics on this bike   
And another one how to change water in the radiator. 

Then here are the main steps :

* Remove the windshield (4 screws)
* Remove the black plastic cover under the windshield using the pins
* Disconnect the instrument cluster (2 nuts, 8mm)
* Remove the instrument cluster cover
* Remove 2×2 upper fairing screws (hex head) with Allen key
* Remove the fairing without the instrument cluster
* Remove the fairing with the instrument cluster — don’t forget the clip
* Unclip all the pins inside the fairings
* Remove the inner fairing lining (wires attached)
* Unscrew 4 hex screws from the lower fairings
* Remove the lower fairings
* Disconnect the turn signals
* Remove the side covers (1 hex screw in the middle of the two fairing bars)
* Remove the radiator reservoir (2 screws) — be careful with the hoses
* Remove the single radiator screw
* Unclip the radiator on the opposite side
* Tilt it forward
* Remove the plastic cover under the RR (2 screws)
* Remove the RR from its mount (1 screw, a rubber fitting) and 1 clip"

2008 GMC Front Clank
My 2008 Sierra (4WD) has been rock solid and I have babied for its whole life. But two issues have come up and I’d love quick advice:

1. Front Driver Side Clank (Low Speeds)
	•	Happens only sometimes, when braking/accelerating at low speeds.
	•	Shop said could be upper control arms, struts, or CV axle.
	•	Axle boot has been leaking for a year—could it finally be causing this?

2. Exhaust Leak
	•	Truck sounds rougher/louder suddenly.
	•	No smell in cab, no check engine light.
	•	Maybe manifold gasket or flex pipe?

Would you fix these now or wait? Trying to avoid wasting money but keep the truck reliable. Appreciate any input if you need more pictures I’m happy to provide!

Camry 2013 $7500 Repair
I have a 2013 Camry (65,000 miles) which had major engine overheating due to a broken belt tensioner. A blown head gasket is confirmed and recommendation is to replace the engine due to the overheating which may have caused bigger problems in the cylinder head and the block. 

Notes from diagnostic:
""Vehicle experiencing loss of power while driving. Inspection found coolant reservoir overfilled and pressurized due to engine combustion gases entering the cooling system. Cylinder #4 has coolant pooling on the piston, confirming a failed head gasket."" 
There's also severe engine misfires. 

The best quote I have to replace the engine is a 54,000 mile engine with 3-year warranty plus other parts (plugs, water pump, etc.) for $7500. The shop also sells used cars but they said the car looks in good shape other than the engine so if I'm going to stay in the same price range, I'm better off fixing this car than looking to buy something for $8-9k. 

For context, book value is $6k as per Kelly blue book which I've been told might be less relevant post-COVID. 

Any advice would help - My logic to repair is that I drive 2k miles a year so even if the car runs another 20k miles, I'm good for a decade so spending $7.5k on repair seems the easiest way to get a reliable vehicle (known history) for at least another decade. Please let me know if I'm missing something! "

Need an alternator
Going to start by saying I have the mechanical knowledge of a 7 year old so sorry if I leave out any details or info needed.

Wife drives a 2014 town & country minivan 6 cylinder 3.6 gas (no flex).

While she was in line to pick up our daughter from bible school study the battery light came on (she still had to wait 20 minutes and the drive home 30 minutes after). She barely made it home then the vehicle would not turn back on.

I got home from work and we jumped it and it started but every time after would not start on its own.

We bought a new battery for the vehicle in October 2024 so we didn’t think it was the battery but had a cheap voltmeter and tested it and it said low/recharge/replace. Took it up to Walmart where we got the battery and they confirmed and swapped out the battery.

I got the new battery in and it started right up on its own. The next day (today) she was driving my daughter back to bible school study and the battery light came back on. She made it to autozone and they said the alternator was bad.

I have a few quotes from shops at $800-1000.

An associate at my work said he could change it out for me if I got the alternator but I’m not sure which of these I should be getting or if they actually fit my vehicle. I’m looking at the Bosch ones but one is new and one is remanufactered. (The ones from autozone advanced were all $400 or so) the new one when I google that part it says it’s for jeep grand Cherokee and the remanufactured one says it fits my vehicle but was concerned since it shows a different part number than the new one. Any insight or advice or confirmation that both or one of these will fit my vehicle and is rockauto reliable?

TLDR: will both the Bosch fit my vehicle since they are different part #s or only one and which would you recommend if any and is rockauto reliable."

Bought second-hand Mazda Demio – stalling issue nobody can diagnose. Need help!
TL;DR:
Bought a second-hand Mazda Demio from 2016 from a dealer in Malta. Car broke down soon after purchase. My mechanic suspected fuel in the engine oil. The dealer replaced parts and attempted repairs multiple times with his own electrician and mechanic, but the car still stalls when shifting from Park to Drive/Reverse, with no fault codes showing up. Now it’s back with an electrician. I’m not very technical, so I’m looking for advice on what could be going wrong.

⸻

Full Story:
Hi everyone. Last month I bought a second-hand Mazda Demio from a licensed car dealer here in Malta. After the purchase, I took it to a trusted mechanic for a routine check-up and service, just to be on the safe side.

During this checkup, my mechanic noticed a strong fuel smell in the engine oil and warned me that something might be seriously wrong. He advised that I monitor the car over the next 100 km to see if any issues would develop.

Sure enough, after about 100 km, the car suddenly lost power and stalled while in traffic. The dashboard and radio remained on, indicating that it wasn’t a total electrical failure. I had the car towed back to my mechanic, who diagnosed a faulty high-pressure fuel pump (HPFP).

I informed the dealer, who provided a replacement HPFP for free. However, the replacement did not resolve the issue. My mechanic then observed that several electrical errors began appearing during further diagnostics. Following the dealer’s advice, I took the car to an auto electrician of his choice, but that electrician did not find any error codes.

With no clear answers, the dealer then had the car taken to his own mechanic. This mechanic also confirmed that no fault codes were present, but he noted that the car starts normally but immediately stalls when shifting from Park into Reverse or Drive.

Over the next week or so, this mechanic stated he:


	•	Replaced the high-pressure fuel pump (again)

	•	Replaced the torque converter

	•	Replaced the fuel injectors

	•	Even disassembled the entire gearbox


Despite all these efforts, the issue remains unresolved. Now, the car has been returned to the electrician, who suspects that it might be due to a twisted wire or something similar.

Additionally, although the dealer provided a temporary replacement car, it’s in poor condition and not practical to use. It’s now been over a month since I purchased the Mazda Demio, and I still don’t have a reliably working car.

⸻

Looking for advice from Mazda Demio owners or auto mechanics:
I don’t have a vast knowledge of cars, so I’d really appreciate your help in understanding what might be going on. Based on the symptoms and the parts that have been replaced:

	•	What could cause the car to start fine but immediately stall when shifting from Park into Drive or Reverse?

	•	Does it sound plausible that a twisted wire could be responsible, or might it be something else (like sensor issues, fuel delivery problems, or even an ECU malfunction)?

	•	Is it unusual that no fault codes are being recorded, despite the seriousness of the problem?

	•	Could the original fuel-in-oil issue have led to more significant engine or electrical damage over time?

	•	Overall, does this situation seem fixable, or should I consider pushing for a full replacement or refund from the dealer?


Any explanations in simple terms or personal experiences would really help me figure out my next steps. Thanks in advance for your insights!"

Hey guys so my 2013 GMC Terrain has been pretty reliable over the years up until the other day when the battery service light came on when I was on the way to work. I wanted to know if anyone could tell me exactly what the problem is, my best guess is my alternator died on me but I am no mechanic.

After the battery service light came on, shortly afterwards I was entering an 80km/h zone and noticed my car would not speed up to 80, it was topping around 70-75km/h max.

Shortly after this, I got a message saying that Stabiltrak was disabled, and then right after that I lost power steering. Luckily I was just pulling into work so I instantly parked and my center console lost power as well as my fans stopped working after I was parked. Now I need to tow it but could anyone offer insight based upon what I described and confirm if it likely to be my alternator? I also don’t want to dish out $600-700 so I was also wondering how difficult it would be for me to change it on my own if I have to. Thank you"

VW 1.4 tsi turbo inlet pressure sensor errors
09 Scirocco 1.4 tsi twincharge - and before anyone reminds me, I know they're not known for reliability. Mines actually been pretty good to me but lately I've been getting a turbo/supercharger inlet pressure sensor error.

I've replaced the sensor (which I confirmed was faulty with my mechanic who took readings with VCDS) with original Bosch, and cleared the errors - but my car is still in limp home mode and sometimes lights up the check engine light.

For a while the error was inconsistent. I'd drive to work in limp home mode, and drive back home fine. But now it's always in limp home mode.

My mechanic said that the sensor might need some time to 'adjust' and give proper readings to the ECU - which may be why it's still bringing up the same errors. It's been almost a week now and allowing time for an ecu and new sensor to get used to each other seems a bit strange to me.

Finally - when I clear the errors myself (I use OBDeleven) I can rev beyond 3k rpm for a while but the car seems to dump boost somewhere between 3.5 and 4k rpm - whilst I'm still on the throttle. Torque doesn't feel as linear as usual either when accelerating - I'd describe it as a bit 'wiggly' rather than a consistent pull.

Is there something I'm missing or anything else I should check? I have a feeling that my wastegate could be messing up but I'm not sure how to check or confirm"

What’s the best way to add AC to a 1997 Honda Civic 1.6 GLS (UK model)?
Hi,

I’ve got a 1997 Honda Civic 1.6 GLS (petrol, UK model, Honda engine not Rover) in really good condition. The only issue is that it doesn’t have air conditioning, and with how hot it’s getting in the summers now, I’m looking into having it installed.

I don’t have a garage or driveway — I live in the city and the car’s parked on the street about 3 minutes from my flat. So I can’t really do any of the work myself. A mechanic would be handling the whole job, including sourcing the parts or stripping a donor car if we go that route.

I’ve been considering a few options:

- Having the mechanic strip a spares/repairs donor Civic that has factory AC

- Getting the mechanic to source all the used parts separately

- Trying to find a full retrofit kit if such a thing exists for this car

I’m not sure which is the most reliable or cost-effective route. The donor car option sounds ideal in theory, but only if the system is still in working condition and not rusted or damaged. If parts are sourced separately, I imagine it could take time or result in compatibility issues.

Does anyone here have experience with adding AC to this generation of Civic?

- Which option would you recommend?

- Are there any decent retrofit systems still available for a 90s Civic in the UK?

- Any idea how much labour time this would realistically take a shop if they’re doing everything?

Thanks in advance. Any advice appreciated.

Ps. Don't tell me to sell the car. "

'03 Chevy Tracker's Engine Shuts Off after 100 to 150 Miles
Got an '03 Tracker zr2 with ~60,000 miles on it a year ago. It had been a super reliable car until 2 months ago. I was sitting at a red light and turned on the AC. As soon as I pressed the button the engine died and would not restart (just some click, no attempt to turn over). Jumped it and it died again after it was put into drive.
We towed it back to the house and charged the battery. Once it was replaced it drove fine, for about 100 miles. The first symptom was a decrease in power while driving up hill. Then the service engine light came on, then the air bag light flicked on and off, then the turn signals (and possibly brake lights) stopped working. Finally, no more acceleration. I coasted to a safe spot on the side of the road. There the engine idled fine but died when I took my foot off the break. It would not restart but once it was jumped, it drove another 15 miles to home.
We replaced the battery with a new battery  Then the same thing happened after ~100 miles of driving.
The alternator tested fine (it was rebuild shortly before I got the car), but we replaced the regulator in the alternator. This time it drove for around 150 miles before repeating the same symptoms. 
Myself and my Father in Law are stumped and a shop that looked at it also couldn't diagnose it.
I'm 99% sure it's the alternator not charging the battery  and the car slowly looses power, but everything we test shows it's fine

Currently, our household fleet consists of a 2003 Honda CR-V with 280,000 km (174,000 miles) and a 2012 Honda Civic with 200,000 km (124,000 miles).
I'm seriously considering selling one of our current Hondas to make room for this Audi. My gut preference usually leans towards Hondas and Toyotas for their reliability and lower maintenance costs, but... this Audi is free!
I'm well aware that the Audi will likely be significantly more expensive to maintain and repair down the line. However, the potential trade-offs seem pretty appealing: improved comfort, enhanced safety features, and much better handling in our snowy winters.
So, here's my dilemma: Would swapping out one of our reliable (albeit older) Hondas for this high-mileage, ""free"" Audi Q5 diesel be a good idea? Or am I just asking for future headaches?
Appreciate any thoughts or experiences you can share!

Is building an LS-swapped FC RX-7 a bad idea for a first drift/street car?
I’m trying to get into drifting and want to build my first real drift/street car. I’ve been looking for a clean FC RX-7 rolling shell — but I only want a hardtop or coupe, not a convertible. Problem is, all I can find right now are convertibles, and I’m not trying to deal with the extra weight or chassis flex of a convertible, especially for drifting.

It would be a rolling shell, so the rotary engine wouldn’t even be in there anymore.

My original plan is to LS1 swap it with a T56, keep it streetable, and build something reliable, fun, and balanced. I know the LS adds weight, but I’m hoping with proper mounts and placement I can still get close to a 50/50 weight balance. The FC is kind of a dream car for me — I love how it looks and the era it comes from. But I’m not really into the idea of keeping the rotary. I don’t want to deal with the maintenance, rebuilds, or worry about apex seals blowing up mid-drift. That’s what got me looking at LS swaps in the first place — solid power, solid reliability, and huge aftermarket support.

That said, I’m trying to be realistic. This would be my first build and my first drift car. I don’t want to take on something way too complex or expensive and just end up overwhelmed with a half-finished project sitting in the garage. It’s easy to talk myself into something like this, but I know it could also turn into a money pit real fast.

I’d really like to hear from anyone who’s done LS swaps specifically for drift builds. Even if you haven’t driven an FC RX-7 with one, I’d still appreciate any insight from people who’ve built or drifted LS-powered cars. I’m planning to look for a pick-and-pull LS1 — nothing crazy, just something solid and reliable enough to build around on a budget. Does this sound like a smart first build, or am I better off holding out or looking into a different chassis?

Any honest input would help a ton. Thanks in advance."

2019 Dodge Grand Caravan - Hydro-locked Engine (131k Miles): Repair vs. Total Loss Payout? Need Advice!
Hey everyone,

Hoping to get some collective wisdom here, especially from any mechanics or folks who've been in a similar boat.
My 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan, which has 131,000 miles on it, recently hydro-locked. It's looking like it needs a complete engine replacement, and the repair quote for a new engine is around $12,000.

Our auto insurance is offering us $11,400 to total the vehicle. We still owe about $5,300 on the van, with an interest rate of 2.8%, and our current monthly payment is around $300.

This puts us in a bit of a predicament, and we're trying to figure out the best path forward.

Here are my main questions:
 * Repair or Total? Given the repair cost ($12k) versus the insurance payout ($11.4k) and what we still owe ($5.3k), and considering the 131,000 miles on the odometer, what are your thoughts? Does it make financial sense to repair it, or should we just take the total loss payout?

 * Dodge Grand Caravan Reliability (Post-Engine Swap & High Mileage)? For mechanics or anyone experienced with this make/model: If we do get a new engine, what's the general consensus on the long-term reliability of a 2019 Grand Caravan with 131k miles already on the chassis? Are there other common issues we should anticipate down the road, even with a new engine (e.g., transmission, electrical)? Is it ""worth"" keeping, assuming the repair is done well?

 * New Vehicle Recommendations (If we don't repair): If we decide to let it go, we'll be in the market for a new (or newer used) vehicle. We really value the functionality of a minivan (space, sliding doors, Stow 'n Go, etc.). What minivans or other family vehicles would you recommend looking into, particularly those known for reliability at higher mileage?

 * Vehicles to AVOID: On the flip side, are there any specific makes/models (especially minivans) that you'd strongly advise against due to known reliability issues, high maintenance costs, or other problems, especially looking at used options?

Any advice, personal experiences, or insights would be hugely appreciated! This is a big decision for our family. Thanks in advance!"

used acura advice?
Hello,  I’m debating on buying a used acura 2013  ILX Premium (automatic I4 2.0L/122) with about 77k miles for 14k. It looks like it was well maintained with 1 owner. 

I’m wondering if anyone has any advice or commentary on this car. My research has shown that acura’s are really reliable but I wanted others opinions since i’ll be using this car to commute to school about 20 miles back& forth and have had bad experiences w other used cars. 

part of me thinks the car is overpriced for being more than a decade old but if acuras are as good as my research says then i don’t mind paying it. "

Buy a new car, or fix the one I have?
So, apologies on three things: I am car stupid. I kind of already know the answer despite that. And you probably get a fair amount of posts like this. Please bear with me, I've been driving my car for 14 years and I can't help but be a little leery of looking for a new car.

The car in question is a **2005 Pontiac G6 GT** with just shy of 100k miles. It has not been a terribly reliable car. Issues have ranged from a broken brake caliper that essentially left me without brakes, *so* many dead batteries, a gas pump leak, faulty wheel sensors, corrosion on the BCM that caused weird issues and took months to sort out, a broken shifter cable - and, currently, **it has an oil leak inside of the engine** because the gaskets are failing. It's a slow leak. I can go six months without adding more oil.

The oil leak is expensive to repair and would probably require a rebuild. Hard to tell since it's inside the engine, but it would likely be upwards of $2,000. 

The car has other issues. The sun visor on the driver's side keeps falling out, and the clip for it keeps snapping off. I ran over a crowbar (10pm on an unlit road, and you really don't expect a crowbar! You don't!) and there's a bit of shake when driving over 50. It genuinely has such a bad turn radius that I am embarrassed when I have to make a three point turn. There was a hole in the frame, and water collected in the wheel well in the trunk for a few months before I noticed it. The exterior is scuffed and dented because someone pulled out in front of me and I live in Florida, with the Florida sun. Additionally, the Pontiac is a discontinued line, and the G6 was never a common make. 

What it has going for it: It is a fairly comfortable drive, it's deceptively roomy, and it's orange. That's all I got. Oh, and it's paid for. 

Typing this all out: Please tell me to sell this thing and get a new car. Or is it worth repairing after all? I don't think I could get $3,000 for it. Maybe $3,500 if it didn't have the oil leak."

2017 Hyundai Elantra Catalitic Converter Part Cost
Hello, 

I own a 2017 Hyundai Elantra SE, and after a diagnostic from a mechanic, my catalytic converter needs to be replaced. I have also seen the issue since my check engine light is constantly and I am seeing other signs of it. They quoted me for around $5,000. This is around $4.3k from ""Catalytic Converter with integrated Exhaust manifold"". I have a friend who has been a mechanic for a few years and said they would replace it for me as long as I bring them the part.

I am not the best at finding which sites reliable / what's an appropriate price to pay since from my research these parts go for below 1k.

I understand the risk I'm taking by not having a licensed active mechanic vs a friend do this work for me. I am hoping if someone can recommend a link or two of what to get and why its a viable option so I can carry this process. Thank you in advance!

Car suddenly won't start
I have a '97 Cavalier I got from my grandpa. It was sitting for awhile before I got it, and it has a few issues here and there. I've been slowly trying to fix it up a bit so it can be a reliable high school car for one of my younger siblings or just so I can sell it for a bit more money. It gets driven maybe once a week, just to keep it moving and make sure gas doesn't sit in it for too long. Yesterday, I tried to go get in it after it was sitting for maybe 4 to 5 days. The power locks weren't working, which I thought was weird. I manually unlocked the doors, got in, and the car wouldn't start. Complete silence, nothing happened at all. After checking some fuses, I decided to jump the battery with my truck. I let it charge for about 5 minutes, and tried starting the Cavalier. It started making kind of a chugging noise, which then turned into a rapid, very loud clicking/grinding sound. I then let it keep charging for a total of probably 15 minutes or so. All the lights on the dash were on, the radio display was on, and the car was making the ""door ajar"" beeps. So it's getting enough power to run all that stuff. But when I try to start it, it just makes the really loud clicking and the warning lights on the dash come on (engine, battery, I think SRS and a few others).

I had my brother come and try to start the engine while I watched the engine. The alternator would make a revolution or two, then stop moving and the clicking would keep going for a few seconds before slowing down. After this, I remembered I have a battery tester, so I checked the battery and it said it's bad and should be replaced. 

I've just never had a dead battery that acted like this before, especially out of nowhere. Does it sound like this is only a dead battery or could it be something else as well?"

2009 Hyundai i10 cranks but won’t start — looking for advice on what to check next
Hi all, I’m trying to help someone with their 2009 Hyundai i10 1.2 Comfort that’s having starting issues, and I’d really appreciate some guidance before we start spending money on parts.

The issue:
When you turn the key, the car cranks (turns over) but doesn’t actually start. Sometimes it will start on the 3rd or 4th attempt, but it’s not reliable.

What I’ve done so far:
	•	Cleaned the battery terminals and clamps thoroughly
	•	Reinstalled the battery securely with good connections
	•	Battery is holding charge and cranks the engine strongly

What I’m considering:
	•	I’ve looked into whether it could be spark plugs — could worn plugs cause it to crank but not fire up?
	•	I saw a video describing a weak/failing Bendix in the starter motor, and the symptoms sounded similar to what this car is doing
	•	I’m also wondering if this could be fuel-related (filter, pump) or an ignition coil issue

I’m a confident DIY-er and know my way around cars, so I’m happy to check or replace parts myself — I just want to get a clearer idea of what’s most likely before I go buying things unnecessarily.

Any advice on what to check or how to narrow this down would be massively appreciated!"

2016 Acura 2.4L TLX Subtle Vibratiosn
I posted this in the Acura subreddit, but wanted to post it here as well.

There are subtle vibrations while idling around the steering wheel and seat, which can be heard when the doors are open, accompanied by a rumbling around the chassis.

After searching all over Reddit and a couple of different websites, a lot of people pointed out that it could be a motor mount issue. Since the V4 2.4L engine in Honda/Acuras isn't balanced well compared to the V6 model, which has this subtle vibration.  Wondering if I need to change my transmission mount as well?

Any suggestions would be great, thanks!!

I was wondering where I could purchase affordable and reliable OEM parts (Canada)

Directly from the dealer?

Or from [RockAuto](https://www.rockauto.com/en/catalog/acura,2016,tlx,2.4l+l4,3329109,engine,motor+mount,5552), but unsure if their alternatives can match OEM parts (Ex: SKP)

The car only has 37,000 KM, and I have noticed the subtle vibrations for one month of driving the vehicle. Took it to the dealership multiple times and was told nothing was wrong."

Oil light came on for a split second when I came to a stop and went off immediately when I saw it turn on 🤔
2003 Nissan frontier, engine rebuilt 2 years ago . No issues other than that it has been super reliable I only bought it cheap and had a full $10k engine rebuild from a very reputable shop 

Oil light cam on for a second and went off as quickly as I saw it illuminated…I noticed it lit up right away so it wasnt on longer than a second. 

Was going 60mph on 2 lane highway heading to get fuel (fuel light was on so i was on E) YES I KNOW i shouldnt let my fuel get that low this is of 2004 Nissan frontier, 3.3L vg33e 5spd manual 4x4 ext cab

Oil light came on when I came to a stop at a 4 way intersection then immediately went off

Got to the gas station checked for leaks. none. Checked oil level, full and clean. What’s the deal?? Anyone ever experience this? 

The oil light is right above the empty gas light if that helps trying to diagnose. How do I know the oil is getting into the crank cases and lubricating everything up top? What are symptoms of bad oil pump? THANKS  😊 "

My campus friend insists on changing to premium oil to feel fancy. Is it worth it for my 2015 Corolla?
Hey folks, looking for a little sanity check here.  
  
I’ve been driving a 2015 Toyota Corolla for the last 3 years, bought it with a 9k win I had on Stake which now it’s probably worth closer to $7,000 now. Nothing flashy, but reliable as hell. I do the regular maintenance, oil changes every 5,000 miles, and so far it's never let me down. Just your standard synthetic blend oil, gets the job done, costs me about $50 at the local shop here in Nevada.  
  
Lately one of my friends from campus has been on this car care kick after falling down a YouTube rabbit hole, and now they’re convinced I should upgrade to full synthetic oil because it lasts longer and makes the engine smoother. Thing is, the shop quoted me $80 for that switch, and I’m not convinced that extra $30 is doing much besides making me feel like I’m treating the Corolla like it’s some kind of premium ride.  
  
I don’t mind spending a bit more if it actually helps the car last longer or run better but with a car like this, I’m wondering if I'm just throwing money at something that doesn’t really need it. It’s never left me stuck on the side of the road, and has always gotten me where I needed to go. So I’m not sure if this upgrade is actually worth it, or just something that sounds good on paper.  
  
Has anyone actually noticed a real difference after switching from blend to full synthetic on a car like this?"

Subaru Forester 2013 - Brake Backing Plate Fiasco
I had done the passenger side wheel bearing in the past which took days to get out and the backing plate was fine. Hindsight since this was a west coast car with minimal r\*st now driving in the east I should have replaced the brake backing plate regardless.

Last week, the rear drivers side wheel bearing went and I didn't have time to replace it and got a reliable mechanic to do it. It took him 3 hours to do and quoted an hour, he ate the 2 hours over but I ended up paying him for 2 hours because I felt bad. He said that the brake backing plate was completely gone and he didn't replace it and put the new hub assembly in. He said you don't need an emergency brake it's 2013, and NAPA might not even have the part. Usually he calls, but didn't this time. Anyways, it is what it is.

I checked and my local Subaru has the backing plate, and NAPA has the hardware and shoes. At this point it's only been a week, does it make sense to pull the hub assembly or just live with it? It's bugging me, should I just leave it since it's a 2013 and I'll probably get another another couple of years out of it. The engine was replaced at 189k with a 119k and it's sitting on 222k."

Sold customer a car and A/C needs to be replaced after 6mo
For context, I sold my customer a pre-owned 2022 Nissan Pathfinder with 52k miles at the time of purchase. We sold the vehicle as-is and she declined all extended warranty options. We had serviced it completely and everything checked out on the day of delivery. This was on 11/11/24. 


On 06/13/25, she came in asking me to look at her A/C system to see why it is not blowing cold air just to be sure she isn’t doing something wrong. 

Everything seemed normal on her end, but it definitely wasn’t blowing cold air and I couldn’t do anything to fix it. 

The vehicle had no warning lights or anything on the dash, so I felt it couldn’t be anything major so I advised her to do a refrigerant recharge with Nissan. 

She took the vehicle to the dealership, and they requested to hold it for a few days to find the issue that is causing the A/C to fail. 

At that point, I knew were talking at least a $2,000-$4,000 job so I had her take it to my service tech that I use personally. The pictures attached are what their final evaluations were after doing two inspections. 

They quoted her at about $2,200 for parts and labor. They also offer a 2yr/24k mile warranty for the work done along with a free loaner vehicle during the time being. So if she does the work, it only makes sense to do it here. 

But, I advised the customer to take it back to the Nissan dealer as I found there was a recall for all 2022 Nissan Pathfinders for the A/C condenser pipe, as well as a recall for their being a refrigerant leak. 

Her vehicle didn’t show any open recalls when looking it up, but I don’t have the ability to see if it was completed previously or if it wasn’t due for the recalls. But, still felt it was best to have it at Nissan in case the failure is due to a manufacture defect. 

My questions are mainly for Nissan Tech’s, but is this common for 2022 Nissan Pathfinders? 

I get that Nissan doesn’t have the best reputation for reliability, but it was a big shocker for me to see at under 60k miles.

""Clunking"" out of park gear
I have a 08 Focus with 180K on the old version (more reliable) 4F27E transmission. Everything runs great except the transmission, which is showing its age.

**My problem:**

If the car sits for overnight or longer, it will tend to clunk or thud when I shift out of park to reverse, sometimes pretty harshly.  Sounds and feels bad.  

\--> Why does it do this?  And is it doing any damage when it clunks from P to R?

FWIW, I already use the parking brake with gusto every time as I've heard long before that the parking pawl is not the strongest thing in the world, and later I read that it can also cause this kind of clunk.  So I'm a long time parking brake user, but it doesn't make much difference for this issue.

**My half-solution:**  

To minimize the clunk, I have found running through the gears after turning the engine off/key on seems to help for the next morning when I shift out of park.  It is somewhat effective, but not really perfect.  I am curious about doing the same procedure again before I start the car in the morning, but I'm unsure if that's wise.

\--> Is shifting through the gears in the morning with the car off/key on OK?  Do I need to circulate ATF in the system first by idling or can I do this first thing in the morning?

\-->Finally, is it possible one of the transmission solenoid kits or some similar product on Rockauto might help with this?  My main concern is preventing further damage to the old-ass transmission.  I do the fluid and filter every 30-40K already."

P0420 code (but no check engine light?) - where to get a Cat online without breaking the bank?
My 2010 Honda Accord had the check engine light come on, and the code was/is a P0420.  My local Honda was willing to do a diagnostic for free, so scheduled it for a few days later.  By the time I got the car there the check engine light was no longer lit, but I was told that it was still showing a code and that their recommendation was to replace the front catalytic converter.  A couple days later I borrowed a code reader from my dad and it showed the P0420 as a stored code, even after trying to clear.  Since then I've driven the car nearly 2000 miles and used the scanner a few more times and the code won't go away, but the check engine light hasn't come on since.

I'm confused how the light isn't coming on but the code also won't clear.  Is it just that the Cat (or at least the O2 sensors) do need to be replaced but it's not consistent/problematic enough for the light to come on again?  There are some questions about the borrowed code reader - we're not sure if/how it handles permanent codes, and if we read it right it showed one O2 sensor in the green but didn't have info for a/the 2nd one at all...  The current idea is to do the Cat replacement ourselves to save on labor (seems easy enough), just need to find one for a decent price.  A lot of the OEM sellers are about $1000+ for a CA/NY-approved Cat, but have seen a few other options that seem to have non-OEM for a few hundred less.  What sites are trustworthy in terms of having reliable quality without having to fork out a grand?"

New brake temperatures
Hello long time listener first time caller to this sub.

I have a 2006 dodge ram 3500 drw I have been trying to get back in good condition. I did the pads, calipers, and rotors all the way around and did a bed in.

I'm wondering if it's normal for new brakes to give off heat it seems like the rears are getting warm even when very gentle out of town driving. Approximately 350km or 217miles since changing. 

Shooting with a temp gun Temps seem to be between 100°-140°F on the rotor. Poking around the duals you can feel the heat radiating.
(Temp does not climb the longer the drive. As I took it for a new windshield over an hour away.)


I did torque everything to spec however I'm wondering about the slide pins potentially being to tight due to the torque wrench I was using seeming to be 'weird' the lower I set the torque.

I'm thinking of buying a more reliable torque wrench and adjusting slide pins or is this normal.

Thanks for reading."

Kind of an oddball thing. Friends had a 2003 Maxima with the big ol' 3.5L VQ35DE sitting for several years. I was roped in to troubleshoot a misfire and do a general overall maintenance refresh of everything.

Vehicle generally runs great but after fuel replacing, doing new valve cover gaskets, spark plugs, throttle b0dy cleaning, etc, I am unable to get the vehicle to complete the idle air relearn via my scanner or using the manual method, however.

It generally runs great but occasionally the short term fuel trims will spike lean OR spike rich; the long term have done the same, moving rich or lean by ~10%. Then other times it's fine. No vacuum leaks or exhaust leaks detected, and again: 75% of the time, it idles beautifully with +/- 4% short or long term fuel trims.

I have noticed that the MAF reading seems a bit high for a 3.5L V6 engine. My understanding has always been that for a V6 engine, MAF at idle should be roughly the displacement of the engine, so 5.5-6.5 seems a bit more than the expected 3.5 gram/s.

I'm unable to find a reliable source or compare it to anywhere else, which I'd like to do before dropping $200 on a new MAF."

2009 Rav4 needs engine repair, is it worth it to sell and buy something different?
I have had my rav4 for about 3 years now, in the last year i dropped 1400 on fixing the transmission, less than two months ago 600 on a new compressor, and now she’s shaking on idle and jumping at 45mph. 

Have not gotten a quote on it yet, it could be 200 spark plug replacement or 1300 for engine misfire.  I’d rather sell her now that she still runs fairly well, because I really want an Avalanche, something I’d be willing to drop as much money as I am now just on keeping myself afloat. Thoughts? Or should I bite the bullet and use what little I get for her to offset a down payment on a newer, more reliable car? Personal use only, I go to the gun range and drive around frequently, put a good 70-80miles twice a week "

Car won't shift up a gear when revving engine
I'm currently on the hunt for a new car as after 3+ years of faithful service with a terrible maintenance record as it was my first car and I didn't take as good of care of it as I should've, but as I'm getting ready to sell it I would rather not just give it away for salvage.

Besides the coolant leak I need to fix, the far more pressing issue is when I rev my engine too hard, the warning panel reads, ""slow down or shift up"". After doing some research it appears this is a problem with my spark plugs, but I wanted to see if you all had any other advice as to what It could be?

This car has been hell tbh between wild shaking when going between 60-70 mph, coolant leaks, oil leaks, rapidly worsening speed up hills, worsening acceleration etc, so I'm happy to be getting it off my hands, but would like to get as much as I can for it If possible.

 Car: 2008 Volvo XC90 3.2 L V6 engine

Halfords Battery Check Reliability
Ive recently taken my car to get a new alternator put in after the engine kept failing to start. The mechanic had recommended I get a new battery since the one i currently have (from halfords) is not holding the charge properly and is showing signs of damage. I only recently got the battery put in and still have 4 years left on my warranty so i took to the halfords garage and asked them to check and replace the battery, but they claim that the cell is healthy and that it doesn’t need replacing. 

So how reliable is the halford battery check and how likely is it that they’re having me on to avoid having to change the battery?

Should i bring it back to the mechanic?"

2013 Honda Civic oil change keeper tracker over has been telling us to get oil changes every 10,000 miles
I've been driving my wife's car for the past couple of months and I have been keeping track of when to do the oil change through the gadget on the dash. And it was telling me that my oil life was at 60% this morning. I knew not to trust it as something just felt off. I called the oil change place last night and they were telling me at 71, 400 and something miles to get it changed next as she got the oil changed at 66,400 something. So by this logic it's been having her get oil changes every f****** 9,000 miles if she's been bringing it down to 20%.

So here's my question now, does it go off of mileage or does it go off of an actual sensor that senses the oil life? Why would they think that it's okay to tell people to get oil changes every 9,000 f****** miles? Is this a conspiracy to get people to buy more cars by having them tear up their engines? I'm really glad I did my due diligence here and went with my gut. I really do trust Honda. They make a reliable car and it's only recently that they've lost that title of most reliable if I am not mistaken? So is there something I don't know that they do?"

Is U-Haul hitch installation a bad idea?
My son wants to put a hitch receiver on our 2022 Subaru Outback so he can put on a bike rack. A lot of the hitch receivers I'm seeing online are $300 plus, but Uhaul nearby do them for $300 including installation.

I was wondering if U-Haul does a good job installing hitches, or if it will damage the car, or if U-Haul is a reliable professional installer for the hitch instead of paying $600+ at the Subaru dealership.

Also is there anything I should be aware/concerned about as far as putting an aftermarket hitch receiver on an Outback? Wondering if there's a risk of clearance issues such that we should get the official one from the Subaru Dealership. 

Thank you for the help.

Transmission Crack - is it fixable?
Hello, my gf ran over a couple cinderblocks (long story) and she’s now faced with $4k worth of repairs. Her mechanic said she needs a whole new transmission due to this little crack, and says he can’t fix it since it’s aluminum and it can’t be welded. Online research seems to agree cracks are killers for transmissions, but I just want to double check that this is for sure unrepairable before deciding what to do. Any thoughts or advice would be appreciated, thank you! 

Also- does anyone have experience or input with how reliable a new transmission would be, or if this is a big risk? There’s been no serious issues with the car until now.

Used car dealer wants $3,800 for ""minor engine work"" on car I just bought - is this legit or am I getting scammed?
Hey all, really hoping for some guidance here because I'm pretty stressed about this situation.  
  
Background: Just bought my first ""nice"" car last month - 2019 Honda Accord with 45k miles for $18,500. Been saving up for two years and a win on Stake finally gave me reason ditch my old beater and get something reliable. Got lucky with a work bonus that covered the down payment, so I thought I was finally adulting properly.  
  
The Issue: Three weeks after purchase, car started making a weird knocking sound and the check engine light came on. Took it back to the dealer (still under their 30-day warranty) and they're saying I need:  
  
\- New timing chain ($1,800)  
  
\- Engine mount replacement ($900)  
  
\- Some sensor replacement ($650)  
  
\- Labor and ""diagnostic fees"" ($450)  
  
Total: $3,800  
  
  
\- Is this normal stuff that should have been caught during their inspection? The car seemed fine during test drive.  
  
\- Are these prices reasonable? I'm in the Phoenix area if that matters.  
  
\- Should the dealer be covering this under warranty since it's been less than a month?  
  
They're saying the timing chain issue is ""wear and tear"" and not covered, but that seems sketchy to me for a 2019 car with relatively low miles.  
  
  
Also CarFax was clean, had it inspected by my buddy who's decent with cars, but obviously not a professional, dealer is being pretty pushy about getting the work done through them!  
  
I've got about $4k in savings but that was supposed to be my emergency fund. Really don't want to blow it all on repairs for a car I just bought."

1. There is a dash rattle. Can those be tracked down and fixed?
2. the heads up display is faded. Can it be repaired:

BUT, this CarFax gave me a bit of a pause. The CARFAX shows another alignment after this. is it possible to straighten out alignment once this has happened? It now has brand new Michelin tires.

Finally, they are asking $30,990, plus a DH fee of $699. They also claim another $349 for ""vehicle security transfer"". What, if anything should I pay for this vehicle? thank you.

RV engine won’t shut off
Checked the ignition switch and it was fine. But the wiring is huge mess, and it’s hard to tell where everything is going. But hopefully someone might have an answer?

The RV in question is a 1999 Fleetwood Discovery on a Freightliner Custom Chassis XC with a 5.9l Cummins with a VP-44 fuel pump. The only way to we’ve found to shut the thing off is by pulling the relay shown in the first photo (which I’ve tested and is working fine unfortunately). It had been working fine for several years and over the course of a on and off cycles it started shutting off reliably less and less. To now where it just never does. Everything else lights up and turns on and off with the key (except for the dash which stays on when the motor keeps running). It’s just the motor that keeps going.

There’s also another issue where the turbo will suddenly just stop building boost, which my running theory is the wastegate getting stuck open. So likely unrelated, but I thought I might bring it up just in case.

If anybody has any ideas or has any questions, I’m all ears."

Thoughts (2018 Kia Soul)
Long story short: Tonight on my way I hit a deer carcass going 70 miles per hour. I heard a loud thump, but don’t recall it making the car bump like I hit a speed bump or anything. I immediately pulled over. Gas was leaking, so I know the gas tank will definitely need replaced and bottom trim of rear bumper was broken off.

Already called insurance and got everything started, but won’t have car towed to be looked at until tomorrow.

Just curious if anyone could tell me the if you think there’s a likelihood of more damage I haven’t seen yet (like chances of accident causing damage to whatever the gas tank is attached to) or if you think the wood bumper will probably be replaced verses just the trim.

I’ve attached the pics I was able to take. Pics are of the same lash, just taken from different sides of the car to get both viewpoints."

97 7.3 trans issues

1997 f250 7.3l with the e4od trans

Edited post: because truck turned on again. Wasn’t related to the trans issue as I thought. 



(Sorry in advance this is long but please, 7.3 gurus, im at a loss) 




Just got this old beater, tons of stuff wrong but planned to fix as I go. I realized I have a leak from the dipstick the other day. Nothing crazy but Was low,  read on the Cold line when hot

I threw in a half a quart of trans fluid and planned to get the ats trans dipstick adapter Friday when I get paid 

A day passes, drove maybe 4 miles like this and Last night as im pulling into my road and the trans just disengaged. No sounds, nothing.  just stops

Shut it off and put it in gear and it goes. 

But stops again and I get in front of my house. 

Shut it off, turn it on, put it in reverse and it slowly lists into my driveway. Check the trans fluid and it reads over full on hot (which it was warmed up all the way)

Had a coworker pick me up.After work I Start it and again won’t go into gear, stuck in park this time 

I turn it off. Turn it back on and now it shifts. Put it through all the gears in park and check the fluid running and it says its above hot reading

So I shut it off and drain the half a quart I put in the other night

Turn it on and it won’t shift into any gear🤬

Turn it off, turn it on, and this time it doesn’t fix it, stays not shifting 

Can anyone tell me what this is indicative of? 

It shifted perfectly fine before this "

My 2014 Ford Fusion Hybrid Nightmare (But I’m Fighting Back)
so here’s the whole rundown on what i’ve been dealing with — my 2014 ford fusion hybrid titanium (non plug-in) has been through it and i’ve tried just about everything myself before finally taking it to a shop. if anyone’s had this happen or is dealing with it, here’s what i went through:
	•	the car wouldn’t start, even though the 12v battery was new and charged. i assumed it was the DC-DC converter so i replaced it.
	•	then i realized the coolant was low, even though it was recently changed. turns out, the hybrid cooling pump wasn’t working either, so i ordered and replaced that too.
	•	once both parts were installed, the car still wouldn’t crank. dash lights came on, but no ready mode. got the “stop safely now” warning and the hybrid system was completely dead on the display.
	•	i did manual bleeds and also used both under-hood and under-seat jump procedures. tried letting it sit, tried resets — nothing worked.
	•	got a code U2101 (module config incompatible) along with battery monitoring module bus errors, and others like B1380 for steering controls. radio would glitch and flicker, ABS/traction/hill assist lights stayed on.
	•	tried doing a trickle charge and kept my 12V stable — it wasn’t dying anymore like it was when the converter was bad, so that told me power was flowing correctly now.
	•	still no hybrid function or start.

finally took it to a shop, and they told me the transmission is likely the issue — apparently the inverter and transmission are tied together to help push power between the HV and 12V systems. they jumped the HV and got it to respond temporarily, but the HV wouldn’t hold charge. they also said they heard a knocking between the trans and engine. 😩

then it started overheating while driving, which didn’t happen before the shop “programmed” a module. now it says motor coolant over temp and jerks at certain speeds.

i’ve installed:
	•	new 12V battery
	•	new DC-DC converter
	•	new hybrid cooling pump
	•	bled the system
	•	tried FORScan and scanning modules (still working on full module reset)
	•	no check engine light now, and the HV battery shows up but reads low (voltage was around 90v at one point)

they tried charging the HV at the shop and said it still won’t hold power. now they want to replace the entire transmission, quoting me like $5K. 🥴

i’m a single mom, trying to stay afloat and get my kid to school. this car has stressed me all the way out. just wanted to share what i’ve done and see if anyone else has experienced anything close to this.

my questions:
	•	could all this be caused by a trans issue?
	•	could it just need the HV module reset or proper FORScan initialization?
	•	has anyone seen a low HV battery cause all of this before?

appreciate any help — and honestly just needed to vent too 💔

Is it the oil system, the coolant system, or a third and secret system that is making my truck dashboard light up like a Christmas tree?
2013 Nissan Titan w/ 155K: after considerable time away from the sport, I’m getting ready to start moving horses around again to try to get my international rider status back. I think that the Titan is trying to throw in the towel and I want to get this resolved before I put one of my ‘kids’ on board. 

🛻 white puff of smoke from tailpipe when starting that smells rancid   
🛻 going through oil aggressively   
🛻 low oil pressure light appears intermittently  
🛻 radiator temperature runs hot intermittently  
🛻 air conditioning will not blow cold when radiator radiator temperature is elevated   
🛻 seems to have more issues when driving in the city versus on the interstate, but I may just be delusional   
🛻 low oil and high temperature readings appear and disappear together    
🛻 airbag light is suddenly flashing as I write this but I think that is going to be something unrelated   

I took it to a mechanic and of course the oil light and radiator light wouldn’t come on for him on the test drive; he told me that there was white coming out of the tailpipe because it was ‘condensation’ and that I had low oil on the dipstick because women don’t change their oil enough. I paid cash money for a diagnosis of ‘go F yourself’. Please help point me in the correct direction so that I can work through this chapter and move onto not being afraid that I won’t make it home whenever I go buy horse feed."

1991 accord sudden no start
i picked up my 91 accord a little over a week ago and drove it fine for about 3 days, parked at my girlfriends house and came out to leave the next day, boom no start. it cranks and cranks but no start, we tried everything to fix it for about 3 days and one day it just started. no idea why, we tried replacing things and they made no difference, so we put all the original stuff back in, original fuel pump still in, original injectors, original wiring, original relay (all things we attempted to replace but they made no difference) our instinct was the fuel system because when this happened my fuel pump made no noise at all (checked all relays fuses etc even replaced the whole thing) and we even tested the fuel pump out side of the car and it works fine. so after it spontaneously started i drove it like this for another 3 - 4 days, starting up everytime, and parked at my house, came outside to leave the next day, same issue. so by this point im thinking its a fuel filter because sometimes it starts, sometimes it won’t. in my mind, the fuel filter holds sediment and if it runs with that sediment in it, it can begin clogging it, get stuck for a couple days, clear up, and run fine again. but after changing it the new one leaked, i’ve fixed the leak today but still no start, any ideas on this?"

Hello, I have a 2010 Toyota Corolla and yesterday the cooling fan started running after I turned off the car and took out the key.

Help! Chrysler LA 318
Hi im from Argentina, I have a Dodge GTX, national made car wich has a chrysler la 318 V8 engine. I don't know much about mechanics, but the car belonged to my dad, so it has a lot of sentimental value for me. After a few months of work, I managed to get the car to start. I would start it up once or twice a week, and it was running great.

One day, I started it and the carburetor began to overflow. I checked to see what was going on and realized the gas tank was empty. The fuel was old, and the dashboard is disconnected, so I couldn't tell how much was left. Some dirt from the tank blocked the fuel inlet to the carburetor (it blocked the needle valve).

I took the carburetor cover off, cleaned out some of the dirt that was under the float, put in fresh gas, but the car still wouldn’t start. The electrician told me to check the spark plugs, which had probably gotten dirty from the overflowing fuel (it was a lot). I cleaned them with sandpaper like we had done before, checked the firing order again, but unless I pour fuel directly into the carburetor, it won’t start — and even then, it only runs for a few seconds before shutting off, which didn’t happen before.

What do you think could be causing this? Could it be a carburetor issue? A problem with the fuel pump?"

2018 Ford EcoSport – Key won’t turn to Start in Park unless I use shift-lock override
Hey all,

I’m having an issue with my **2018 Ford EcoSport (automatic, non-keyless start)**. When the car is in Park, the **ignition key only turns to ON (position II)** — not all the way to Start.

Here’s what I’ve found:

* If I press the **shift-lock override button** on the gear lever, then the key turns fully and the car starts fine.
* The **dashboard shows the car is in Park**, so it seems to detect the position correctly.
* The **red shift-lock tab moves** when I press the brake pedal, so the brake switch seems to be working.
* The car **starts fine in Neutral** without needing the override.

I'm guessing it’s something to do with the **shift interlock system**, **gear selector cable**, or maybe an alignment issue — but I'm not sure where to start.

Has anyone seen this before? Is it more likely a mechanical cable adjustment or a solenoid/electrical fault?

Appreciate any advice, not sure if this is a Mechanic, dealership or auto electrician job?

Thanks in advance."

2 valve 5.4 Triton Misfiring/ running rough on cold start
I have a 2004 Ford F250 with the 2 valve triton 5.4. If the truck sits overnight upon a cold start I get a very rough idle and sounds like it’s misfiring. When parked and driving it shakes the whole cab. Sometimes I can drive through it and it’ll clear up other times it won’t, I’ll have to shut it off let it sit for a bit then restart it and it’ll run like nothing ever happened. When this is happening I have almost no power. After I can get it to go away it runs fine, I just finished a 10 hour round trip with a travel trailer without issues. Parked it over night, went out started it and the problem is back. No CEL on dash. Plugged my scan tool in and no codes pending or stored. I did record a live data set of all the sensors my autel scanner can read. I will post a photo with this post. The only thing I noticed is the MAF reading, just wondering if anyone else sees anything suspicious so I can dig deeper and figure this out. I can post more than one snapshot of the live data if needed but they all look similar to this one. "

I need help
I have a 2011 Chevy Silverado.

So my problems started when I was driving and the engine stalled. I cranked it over again and it turned on until it did it again. When I tried to start again it did not attempt to crank. This is normal because my starter wire falls out( broken clip). Right before I stalled my service 4x4 turned on. I got it to work enough to drive it home. Only Half of my dash lights turn on ( door locked,Brake,Battery, and air bag) and won’t crank at all. Codes are a loss of TCM, service 4x4
Things that I’ve changed or tested and know works
Battery 
Fuses 
Alternator

I can’t even get the bolts off the heat shield to replace cat. Should I call it quits
2006 Toyota sienna LE v6 fwd, trying to replace catalytic converters. Quote from the mechanic is astronomical and money is tight so that’s my last resort right now.


I figured it’d be tough but I didn’t expect to hit a wall immediately on starting the project. I got one bolt off the heat shield and stripped another. This is after soaking with penetrating oil. 


I got an impact wrench just for this, which won’t fit on the heat shield bolts. I genuinely thought I might only need the impact wrench for the bolts holding the cat. If I continue this myself I figure it would be cutting off the heat shield, but if those are so rusted out that I can’t get it off without cutting, what does that predict for the rest of the bolts? Am I just gonna strip them too? I’m worried about getting to a point of no return where it’s in pieces and I can’t just drive it to the mechanic. I don’t have the tools or knowledge to weld if I gotta keep hacking stuff off. 


I also haven’t opened the box on the impact wrench so there’s still time to return it if I don’t try to continue lmao. I’d hate to have bought the thing AND had to go to the mechanic anyway. 


To put it shortly, my question is, am I right in assuming the bolts holding the catalytic converters and the y pipe are going to be even more rusted out and difficult than the ones holding the heat shield?"

Car won’t kick over, suspecting fuel pump isn’t operating as normal. Could be starter. I don’t think it’s alternator but I’m not an electrician and I don’t want to start ripping parts out just for the hell of it. Battery pulls 12.62V in stationary, 12.48V with key on. I got around it by disconnecting the battery before but that didn’t work again. I suspect heat is also playing a big part with me living in the south with these 100° weeks. The last time I disconnected the battery, the positive didn’t arc off the battery terminal but this time it did. I have no clue what’s relevant. Any help is greatly appreciated. "

Crank-No-Start After Misfires, Rough Idle, and Stalling – 2006 Honda Accord V6
Hey everyone, hoping someone can help me narrow this down.

I have a 2006 Honda Accord EX V6, and it’s been giving me trouble lately. It started a few weeks after a timing belt replacement with symptoms that slowly got worse:

First I had random cylinder misfires (1, 3, 4, and 6)
Then the engine started idling rough and feeling a bit off at low speeds
After that, it became hard to start, especially when cold
Eventually, the car stalled while driving, and now it just cranks but won’t start

There was low oil when I checked it after the stall (I topped it off, no change).
What’s weird is that the RPMs slightly move while cranking, and once after cranking while pressing the gas it actually started for a second. That’s what threw me off.

I’m currently leaning toward a bad crankshaft position sensor.
I’ve read that it can cause:
Random misfires
Rough idle
Stalling
Crank-no-start
But I’m also wondering if a camshaft sensor, fuel issue, or something timing-related could cause this too. I don’t have any engine codes available right now because my brother cleared them.

Has anyone dealt with something similar?
Would the RPM needle moving rule out a bad CKP sensor, or not necessarily?

Any help, suggestions, or experience would be super appreciated.

2013 Honda Accord won’t start even after replacing starter twice.
Hey all, 
Basically the title. I have a 2013 Honda accord EX-L with a push button start. 

When I try to start the car sometimes, I just hear one click and then nothing. All the lights turn on. Battery voltage was fine. It used to only happen every so often and then it would start after 8-10 tries but it kept getting worse and worse. 

Mechanic replaced the starter and the issue still happened and so they replaced it again thinking it was a bad starter. Unfortunately I am still having the same issue. They had to car to try and diagnose it but they weren’t getting anywhere and I needed the car. Now I can’t get it to start at all. 

Does anyone have any advice. I read maybe replacing the push button switch may work but the car still turns on with the button so Idk. Should I take it to the dealer?"

2015 Volvo s60 tries to start but won’t, any advice
I bought this car last year for a great deal but I’ve had so many things happen that now I’ve paid double and there’s still issues. Another problem is that I live hours away from a dealership so I keep having to tow it. 

Right now the codes showing up are P017100, P001400 (since I got it), and P054B00. The local shop I went to last year said they replaced the cam shaft but when I brought it to Volvo they said nothing was done. Volvo replaced the exhaust cam solenoid. A few days later the check engine showed up again. A friend of mine knows a lot more about cars than I do so he said he’ll clean the exhaust cam to see if it makes a difference and recommended buying a new one online to see if this one is faulty. 

I’m just wondering if anyone has any ideas where to troubleshoot for this. The last couple times when I started the car I noticed it had a harder start and would feel jumpy for a minute or so. Now when I try starting it, it makes the sound like it’s trying then stops. Any advice would be greatly appreciated "

[Help] Audi Q5 2011 — Multiple Brake/ABS/Start Issues After $5K in Repairs — Still Not Fixed (DMV Area)
Hi everyone,
I’m hoping someone here can help guide me. I have a 2011 Audi Q5 and I’ve been having serious issues lately, and I’m honestly at a loss.
Problems:
	•	The car sometimes completely shuts off or becomes unresponsive after braking, like when I stop at a red light.
	•	The RPM drops to zero, and it won’t go unless I turn the car off and on again — but even that doesn’t always work.
	•	Dashboard lights on:
	•	Brake malfunction
	•	Brake warning light
	•	ABS
	•	Car sliding/traction control
	•	It also sometimes won’t start at all — I turn the key, it makes the cranking noise like it’s about to start, but it doesn’t actually start.

What’s Been Done (Already Spent $5000+):
	•	New battery
	•	Brake replacement
	•	Oil + oil filter change
	•	Vacuum cleaned
	•	Fuel injectors cleaned

Now the same shop is telling me the transmission or the cooler is completely gone, and it’ll cost $3000 more. But the original problem is still happening, and I’m starting to feel like I’m being taken advantage of.
My Concerns:
	•	Could this really be a transmission issue?
	•	Could the combination of warning lights and stalling be more related to electrical problems or ABS module failure?
	•	Is it even safe to drive like this?
	•	I’m a girl living alone here in the DMV (DC/Maryland/Virginia) area, and I don’t have family or friends nearby to help me out. I just want someone honest to tell me what’s really wrong.

Has anyone dealt with something similar?
Should I take it to the dealership? A different mechanic? Is it worth fixing at this point?
Any advice or recommendation for a reliable mechanic in the DMV would be truly appreciated.

Thank you so much in advance 🙏

Ford focus transmission overheat AFTER clutch replacement
I drive a 2018 ford focus titanium 2L automatic 97000Km. I’m driving it on the highway a few weeks ago notice its shuttering and is delayed when it switches gears then the check engine light comes on. Couple minutes later it tells me on the dash my transmission is overheating and to stop immediately. I pull over shut it off and give it 10 minutes. When i started it it didn’t want to crank just give me clicking noises as soon as it did it started cranking it went right away though. I put it in drive and it won’t shift out of first gear before telling me its overheating again. 

I get it towed to a transmission mechanic that I trusted he tells me it was my TCM and clutches I have them replaced and the car back yesterday. Today I drove all over the city probably 2 hours worth no shutters or anything that seemed wrong until I go back on the highway. I’m driving and I get the same thing pop up transmission overheating stop immediately. Pull over waited the 10 minutes put it in drive seemed to crawl normally but I was afraid todo anymore than that. 


Couple more details:
I hadn’t had my transmission fluid changed ever before this
Mechanic told me he gave me fresh transmission fluid 
It was a very hot day outside today while I was driving 



I’m just wondering if this kind of thing has happened to anyone else or if anyone has any insight into what might be wrong with it any help or ideas I would very much appreciate.

No accelerator pump squirt – Carter BBD-style carb on ‘79 318 TrailDuster – discharge check valve stuck?
I’m troubleshooting a no-start issue on my 1979 Plymouth TrailDuster with a 318 and a relatively new Carter-style 2-barrel carb (marked 6-6258).

It starts and runs great when I squirt gas into the carb manually, but it won’t start cold on its own. No fuel squirts when the throttle is pulled, even though the red accelerator pump cup is moving fine.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

* Removed the air horn (top of carb)
* Float bowl has some fuel — not empty
* Accelerator pump assembly and rubber cup look new and intact
* The pump well has the inlet check ball at the bottom — that part is fine
* The discharge port (the small hole between the two brass nozzles near the “10” mark) appears to be **sealed or stuck shut**

I tried spraying starter fluid into the discharge port, but it **sprays back up** — it doesn’t drain into the bowl or pump chamber. That tells me there’s *something in the discharge seat*, probably the check ball, but it’s **not moving** or maybe varnished in place. Plus not totally sure I am squirting in the right hole. Photo attached.

I don’t have compressed air or carb cleaner at the moment — just starter fluid with a plastic tube. I’m reluctant to pry anything aggressively, and I can’t see the check ball directly. What should i do next?"

2012 Citroën C1 won’t start after trying to install a tachometer
Hi everyone,

I tried to install a tachometer in my 2012 Citroën C1. Some cars have a loose cable that makes it a plug-and-play job. I first disconnected the negative terminal of the battery. Then I removed the instrument cluster, but I couldn’t find the loose cable. So I decided to remove the entire cluster and unplug all the connectors to look around.

I got stuck, so I reconnected everything. I reconnected the negative battery terminal tightly. The car started and everything worked fine at first.

However, after turning the car off to put the dashboard cover back on, it wouldn’t start. The starter motor cranked (I could hear it “cough”), the electronics and dashboard lights all came on, but the engine didn’t fire up.

After a few tries, the car started again. But about 10 minutes into driving, I couldn't accelerate anymore and three red warning lights came on: a flashing STOP light, oil pressure warning, and battery warning. The engine stalled, but all other electronics stayed on.

I checked the engine oil level, it was fine. I tried jump-starting with cables but no luck.

I suspect I might have caused this by disconnecting and reconnecting the battery negative terminal and unplugging the connectors behind the instrument cluster. The battery poles are tightly connected but somewhat corroded.

My question is:

What could this be? I'm 99% sure it's my fault, but don't know what to do next. Any help is welcome!"

2019 C300 Cranks But Won’t Start – Ignition Coil Codes P0351 P0352 P0353 P0354
Hey everyone, I’m dealing with a strange issue on my 2019 Mercedes-Benz C300. A few days ago, the car started cranking but wouldn’t turn on.

Here’s the full story:

About two weeks ago, I came back from vacation and hadn’t driven the car at all during that time. On my first drive, the start/stop function activated while I was on the road, and the car shut off at a stop sign. Luckily, it started right back up. I drove a bit further, pulled over, and it shut off again. I had to jumpstart it to get moving.

I went to AutoZone to test the battery, starter, and alternator. All tested fine. After that, I drove the car for the next three days without any issues.

On the fourth day, I hit some light traffic, and the car suddenly shut off again. It started back up after two or three tries and ran normally for about an hour. I parked it for a bit, then drove it again. This time, it shut off at a red light and wouldn’t start again for about 30 minutes.

After another jumpstart, I got it running again and managed to drive home using the highway. But as soon as I exited and had to stop, the car shut off once more. I ended up needing two or three more jumpstarts just to make it back home. Since then, it’s been parked.

I bought an OBD2 scanner and pulled the following codes:

P0351
P0352
P0353
P0354

All of them say: “The actuation of ignition coil (1, 2, 3, 4) has an electrical fault or open circuit.”

Has anyone run into something like this before? Any advice or ideas are appreciated."

I’ve had the battery tested at autozone and they said it’s fine, I’ve rebuilt the inside fuse box, I replaced the alternator, the starter, and starter solenoid switch in engine bay and that allowed it start up but once I turned it off the same problem started again. I also have a Bluetooth radio connector that reads voltage and when I plug that in I get a reading of 10 volts. I’ve also replaced both relays inside that inner fuse box and still the problem continues. I’m tempted to also swap out the ignition switch but I have no clue where to go from here. "

2000 Honda Civic troubleshoot/
I have a 2000 Honda Civic that I purchased about 4 months ago. Everything's been going just fine It doesn't leak oil anywhere it doesn't leave water nothing with the transmission it's been a good car, but I started to notice first that the car would not start it would turn over wouldn't start It would do this just every now and then when it first started then it started getting worse now after a few tries of you matching the gas and turning it over it will crank every time and it would be random just randoms when you turn the car off it just might not crank back for a minute some days he would do it some days it won't, would you open the hood take that black box out with the air filter is put our hand over the holes and it was cranked and did this for a few times that way, then it got to wear that wouldn't do it so I noticed if I let it sit for a minute and then if I hold the gas to the floor and then start patting it as I'm doing it as I'm turning it over it'll crank it'll flood it out but it cranks smell gas real bad but it'll crank. Now it started to when I came to a stop it would sure would go up on it and then when I take off the temperature will go back down I will go check the radiator then be no coolant in it no water in it a refill it back up have the same problem, couple days later I checked the thermostat to replace it I found it the housing unit is cracked so I replaced those two things now here's our big question, after our place those two I went to crank the car I noticed that the green light around the D4 was flashing also it had a really bad spider to it and was trying to go dead on me when I matched the gas at first take off after I got take dog and took off it it went on every time I came to a slow point or stopped and did the same thing I drove the car back home and now I don't not sure what to do next I'm not sure what I could have done or what I could have damaged to cause this I'm not even sure where anything would be located I'm not a good at cars I don't know many people so it's just me and my boyfriend and he's not a mechanic, currently at the moment it will not start it's just turning over again and I haven't got to start yet, please can have something to do with each other or they could be completely different not sure, I do know that I have to replace the air assist valve on the thermostat but I also was told that that wouldn't have anything to do with the car cranking or running with without it it's just not advised to drive without it, I don't think that it's the transmission itself because like I said I had no prior issues with the transmission at all prior to this I think maybe we did something more replacing those two things I'm just not sure which one it would really be or where it would be located if someone could help me with this or greatly greatly appreciate it It would help me so much in this quest that I'm on thank you so much"

Car sometimes doesn’t charge under load
I have an older Mercedes 1988 260e

My car will sometimes not charge properly when under load. The abs light will turn on (which indicates I’m getting low voltage according to the owners manual) and the car will run rough

However, I’ve replaced the alternator, the voltage regulator, the brushes, the battery, everything. It still won’t go away. I’ve also had the grounds checked.

Worst thing is that it’s intermittent. I can’t pin down an exact cause. Sometimes it’s only minor, sometimes my car will straight up not want to keep running. Seems to also be worse while at idle, and is worse with more electronics on.

Recently it’s been alright. I’ve been able to use the car properly, but I tried using everything, like wipers, headlights, seat heaters, and it started giving me problems again

No idea how to pin this down. The shop I brought it to tried replacing the battery and alternator again, but it didn’t change anything. Eventually they gave up and gave it back to me.

EDIT: I should mention that I actually had the alternator replace the week after I bought my car, as it seemingly failed randomly. I started encountering these load problems about a year after the alternator was replaced. The shop tried replacing the alternator under warranty again, but it didn’t stop the problem, so they put the original alternator back in.

Any advice on where to go from here?"

2009 Toyota Corolla turns over but won’t start. Did the metal tape on my key cause this?
I have a 2009 Toyota corolla with the 1.8L engine. 

A couple weeks ago the plastic housing for my key broke apart when I tried to start the car. I put it back together and taped it up with electrical tape, but the tape eventually started to slip off and was just not a great solution. Today, I decided to use some metal foil tape for ducting because I had some at work and I knew it wouldn’t slide around like the electrical tape did. However, when I went to start my car to go to lunch, it would crank but not start. 

During my googling, I read that a bad key can disable the injectors as a security feature. I’m not certain on the validity of this, but the metal tape was probably touching the actual key part, or at least the metal housing of the ignition in the car. 

It started and drove perfectly fine a couple hours ago, before the tape change. It got a new battery a little over a year ago and a new alternator a few weeks ago, plus the crank isn’t weak at all. No flickering or dimming lights, so I don’t think that’s the issue. 

Am I on the right track with the issue? And if so is there a way for me to reset things without taking it to a locksmith or dealer? I’m sure you can tell by the fact that I taped my key that I don’t really have the funds to pay someone to fix this for me. "

PLEASE HELP [2005 Accord 2.4L] Car Dies After One Drive — Electrical + Transmission Issues After Starter Replacement
Car wouldn’t start — no crank, no click. Replaced the starter, and it started right up.

But right after that, all this happened:
	•	No acceleration / felt stuck in one gear
	•	Dash gauges dead
	•	Windows stopped working
	•	Rough idle / car jerking at stops

Put in a brand new battery — car ran perfect again, but only for one drive.

Next time:
	•	Same exact issues came back
	•	Gauges dead again
	•	No throttle
	•	Transmission acting weird
	•	Car loses power and won’t start after

This has now happened twice — car runs fine with a fresh battery, but dies after one drive.

Haven’t replaced the alternator yet. Just trying to figure out if it’s:
	•	Bad alternator not charging
	•	Ground or power wire issue from the starter install
	•	Something else electrical

Anyone run into this before? Need help diagnosing — not trying to keep throwing parts at it."

Audi a4 b8 won’t open
I have a serious issue with my Audi A4 B8 (2009):

Both my main key and spare key have working batteries, and the car battery is also fine.

Still, the car won’t respond — it does not unlock via remote, and even the manual key in the driver’s door lock doesn’t work. I’m completely locked out. The car does not react at all.

Roadside assistance suspects the car is in «deadlock mode» or something, which disables the interior door handles to. They say the only solution is to break a window and climb in, then start the car to deactivate the locks.

Has anyone experienced this before?"

2008 Jeep Liberty Crank/No Start
My 2008 kk has a problem where the starter works and turns the engine over, but it won’t disengage (what it sounds like at least) and then the car dies. This ONLY happens in hot weather/summer and never on the first start of the day. Instead, it happens after the car was running for a bit, then off for ~10-20 minutes, and trying to start again (think going into the grocery for a few things then coming back out). I used to be able to remedy this by pressing the accelerator as I turn it over when this happens, but this fix doesn’t work anymore. Is this a starter problem? Fuel issue?

I’ve suspected issues with fuel pump/fuel injectors for a bit because the vehicle will stutter/jolt when steadily accelerating (not slowly accelerating, and not when accelerating quickly, only moderate acceleration) and I’ve ruled out transmission as the cause for this. Could these two issues be related and tethered to the fuel system? Thanks for any ideas."

My Hyundai got broken into and almost stolen. Need advice on repair and cost estimate!
First time poster here. My car (2011 Hyundai Sonata) got broken into at night while I was out of town and I am assuming the aim was to steal it. I had gotten the anti-theft upgrade from Hyundai dealership a couple of years ago and I think that’s why they couldn’t drive away with it. The driver’s side rear door window was smashed and the box under the steering wheel assembly was opened up and tampered with (pic as I found it). I got my building manager to cover the window with a trash bag in my absence so water doesn’t get in as it was supposed to rain. The whole steering wheel assembly is loose and the car won’t start - even the ‘open trunk’ and window buttons don’t work. Any ideas on what my next steps for repair should be along with any rough cost estimates? Fyi - I don’t have comprehensive insurance so I will be paying out of pocket but I do have roadside assistance (progressive) so I can get it towed to the mechanic shop. I am not very knowledgeable about cars so all advice is appreciated!"

2006 Hummer H3 Crank no start
I’m having a really tough time with my 2006 Hummer H3 (3.5L). The engine cranks normally, but it just won’t start and I’ve been chasing this issue for a while now without much luck.

Here’s what I’ve done so far:

Timing chain is in correct position, verified, no signs of jumping or slack.

No spark and no injector pulse during cranking.

Replaced both the camshaft (CMP) and crankshaft (CKP) sensors, multiple times, with known good sensors.

Wiring to both sensors checks out, good continuity, clean connectors, no corrosion.

All fuses and relays are intact and tested good.

ECU has power and grounds are solid.

The only code I’m getting is P0341 – Camshaft Position Sensor Range/Performance, and it stays even after all the above.

Scanner used is Autocom (generic OBD), which shows basic info but doesn’t give full GM-specific data.


The issue is I’m based in Europe, and over here, parts for the H3 are hard to find, and not many people are familiar with this engine or platform. No dealership support either, so I’m stuck relying on online info and the community.

At this point, I’m wondering, could this be an ECU fault? What else could cause both spark and fuel to be disabled, along with a persistent P0341?"

RPM Goes Up Crazy, yet Car doesn’t accelerate.
Hi, I don’t have much experience when it comes to cars. I drive a (‘06 or ‘07) Ford Explorer and I’ve been dealing with this issue for the last two weeks. 

For the most part, the car drives alright. Except every now and then while driving the car starts revving/the rpm gauge goes up really high while I step on the gas but won’t accelerate and I have to pull over (happens mostly on highway but in the city too). It also starts jerking here and there.

Check Engine Light pops up every só and then, yet couldn’t diagnose the issue.

Took it to the mechanic, yet he fixed a lot of other problems on the car as well took a look at the transmission.

2011 Tahoe newly rebuilt motor. Starts and idles, but randomly died and won’t idle now. MAF code and TP code.
I just rebuilt this motor. Knew everything internally. Pistons, main bearings, rod bearings, timing components etc. you get the picture. This isn’t my first build for reference. Needed rebuild due to AFM lifter self destruction.

Initial start up was rough as expected. Used a Diablo tuner and tuned out AFM. Idles like a sewing machine! I let it run for 15 minutes and no changes so I decided to run it around the block. A block away it randomly died. It would start then immediately stumble and die. Then 10 minutes later it started and stayed running so I drove it home. 

My scanner doesn’t do live readings so I was hoping maybe someone had seen this before and could provide tips. I did add sea foam to the gas today, and cleaned the MAF sensor and Throttle Body. What now?

2013 Chevy Spark – Weird Shifting Behavior After TCM Replacement (No Downshift from 3rd, No Speedo Unless in 3rd or Off Gas)
**EDIT: I forgot to mention I've already replaced the speed sensor and the wiring for the speed sensor.**

Hey all, hoping someone here can help me make sense of this issue. I recently replaced the transmission control module (TCM) on my 2013 Chevy Spark and had it reprogrammed. Before replacing it, I had a code reader pulling TCM-related codes. After replacement, I haven’t re-scanned for codes yet (will do that soon), but the car is behaving strangely and I’m trying to get some insight before throwing more parts at it.

**Symptoms:**

* The car shifts from 1st to 2nd gear fine.
* As soon as it goes into 3rd gear, it will **not downshift** at all, regardless of throttle position or speed.
* The speedometer doesn’t work **unless** I’m in 3rd gear *or* my foot is **off** the gas.
* It shifts **very hard into 1st gear**, like a noticeable jolt.
* No current codes (haven’t checked yet post-TCM swap, but before it only showed TCM codes).
* TCM has been properly programmed after install.

This feels like it could still be an electrical issue, maybe a speed sensor or wiring problem, but I'm not sure where to start.

Any thoughts on what might be going on here or what to check next?

**TL;DR:**

* 2013 Chevy Spark
* Recently replaced and reprogrammed TCM
* Shifts from 1st → 2nd fine, but gets stuck in 3rd (won’t downshift)
* Speedo only works in 3rd gear or when off the gas
* Hard shift into 1st gear
* No new codes checked *yet* after TCM replacement"

Help! Suddenly my 2013 Ford Edge push button won’t start the engine. And my parking gear refuses to function properly
My 2013 Ford Edge Limited V6 is having an issue with starting the engine with the push button. It happened very suddenly after I had stopped and turned off the car for about 20 minutes, and since this issue began it hasn’t been working correctly for a few days. The car also doesn’t register its in park either, and as soon as I shift it into park, the P no longer illuminates, and then quickly goes into reverse. I’ve since changed the brake light switch thinking it may be the issue, but it doesn’t fix it. My solution so far has been to remote start the car, and to quickly use the emergency break every time I take the car somewhere.

Ive checked most of the fuses with a multimeter and the ones that could be affecting the issue, all came back working correctly.

I’ve never had this problem before and after it started the other day, it hasn’t went back to normal, and it’s difficult to find anyone who has had the same exact issue"

2011 F150 won’t start, rarely
Good morning,

Got my first F150 a few months ago, and absolutely loving it. It’s an older rusty 2011 F150 with the 5.0 V8. I work my trucks a bit so prefer them to be a little more broken in. 

Anyways - 

The truck starts and runs great 95% of the time. About once every 10 days, the truck doesn’t start. I get two clicks on the passenger front floor board, all power and lights come on, no turn over no crank. 

I’ve checked fuses under the hood, and under the passenger airbag. Replaced relays.

I’ve had it towed twice, and I’ve had the small time dealer I bought it through come pick it up twice, all 4 times, it’s started right up upon someone else coming to assist with it, making it very difficult to diagnose. 

I’m wondering if anyone’s had similar issues?

The seller has been immensely helpful investing hours into it trying to figure it out, removing the aftermarket remote start, etc. it’s just increasingly difficult when the issue rarely presents itself. 

Any insight is appreciated, thank you. "

2014 Honda CRV randomly won’t start
Hello!

I have a 2014 Honda CRV 2.4-liter inline-four engine that wont start at random times. This began about 2 weeks ago. I would turn the key and all electric would come on (a/c, lights, etc) but the engine wouldn’t turn over and no mechanical noises like clicking, grinding, anything. Nothing at all. I’d turn everything off, wait a moment, try again and it would start. Last Saturday it happened but this time it wouldn’t start at all. I called AAA who gave me a jump start, I immediately went and changed the battery in case that was the issue. Took it to mechanic Monday, they ran diagnostics specifically checking the alternator and said it was charging fine and they couldn’t find anything wrong. No problems until the next day when it wouldn’t start. I tried twice, 5 min in between and nothing. Waited 20 min, and then it started. I took it back to mechanic who said it could be one of the batter cables that they “didn’t like the look of” and replaced it. That was Tuesday. Thursday it did it again, but this time started on the second try within 30 seconds. 

I’m a bit frustrated as I don’t have transport means without my car and where I live isn’t walkable. 

Any ideas? Could it be the starter? Should they have been able to catch that?"

I ended up using uber eats and paid $30 to get oil delivered to my work. I put an entire quart in there and drove home (3 miles). Before I was going to leave for work today, I checked the oil again to be safe and there was nothing on the stick again. When I looked under the car, there’s a huge wet mark. Could this be an oil leak? How much does this normally cost to fix? I’m a broke college student with $80 in my bank account (after buying yesterday’s oil) and can’t afford a huge mechanic bill.

I’m not sure if this is relevant but I drive a 2010 Lexus 450 H. I know it’s a nice car for a broke college kid, but there was an older woman who was selling it for really cheap a few years ago.

The first picture is what my oil stick looked like yesterday. I didn’t take a picture of it today but it was pretty similar to the first pic, with only a few drops of oil on it.

The second picture is the oil I put in my car.

The third picture is the wet mark underneath my car. It’s on the front left side.

I mainly just want to know what it is and how much it’ll cost to replace. I’ll get it fixed eventually and won’t drive it until then, but I really need my car for work so I’m trying to figure out how long my car is gonna be out of service for. "

‘96 GMC sierra V6 won’t start, will run if I spray carb cleaner directly into the Intake
As the title states, old farm truck won’t start. I replaced the fuel filter a few years ago, I can’t feel it humming when I cycle the key so I at least know it’s turning on. Replaced the fuel filter still won’t start.

 Plugged lines? Weal pump causing low pressure? Fuel regulator failed?

What do I do next here?"

Honda Civic 2017, timing chain snapped
I was in a car park, had parked up fine and then got back in the car and it wouldn’t start - a mechanic has looked at it, he confirmed the chain has snapped and he used a camera thing and said he can’t see any damage at the top of the engine

Would looking with a camera determine that? I’ve been turned back by 10 garages saying they won’t even look at it as it’s ’too big a job’

I need it fixed ASAP as the PCP is up, I owe £4,300 on it. I don’t know whether to spend the money getting the engine looked at, what are the odds it hasn’t caused huge damage inside?

It’s a 2017 Honda Civic, 69,000 miles 

I’m so stressed 🥹"

2011 Toyota Sienna Limited - battery or alternator issue
So I am not very experienced with car repairs. I know how to change spark plugs, but that’s about it.  Yesterday while sitting idle in a parking lot, my battery light came on. While driving home, the power steering light also came on, and then all the lights came on and the car mostly stopped (pressing the gas would make the car slowly “hop”, as in the speedometer would keep jumping but I could barely steer, or accelerate until I got it home (it was a few minutes away).
Now when I try to start it, it makes a rapid clicking sound but won’t start, which makes me believe it’s the battery or the alternator.
I’m going to test the battery this afternoon, but if it’s the alternator, how difficult would it be to change? I found a step by step list of how to change it, but it looks like you have to take out the radiator fans and other parts of the front of the car. If I follow the steps closely, would it be smart to try to change it myself? I don’t really have the money to bring it to a shop unfortunately and I love learning new things. I just don’t know if it’d be too much of a pain in the ass or not. Also, how can I tell if it’s the battery or the alternator? Do I just jump my battery and let it charge, then try to start it without the jump?"

Bentley V8 issue any help?
Intermittent issue on my 2014 Bentley GTC V8. Sometimes it cranks but won’t start unless I floor the gas. Once it starts, it runs fine under normal driving.

On hard acceleration, I sometimes get a flappy rubbery weird noise coming from near the hood, a small puff of smoke from the exhaust, and a flashing check engine light that disappears after i slow down and drive normally.

Codes:
		P0300 – Random/multiple misfire
	P0306 – Cylinder 6 misfire
	P0333 – Knock sensor 2 high input

This first happened once about 6 months ago, then nothing for months. Now it’s showing up more often almost daily and if i let it just crank without pressing gas the rpm goes up but suddenly the engine just turns off 

Coils and spark plugs were replaced, and everything else is supposed to be in good shape. Otherwise, the car drives perfectly

Any idea what it could be? "

Advanced Auto Parts/ Lifetime warranty/ Dorman OE Solutions Junk New Auto parts
This is just to let people know of my experience with Advanced Auto Parts & Dorman OE Solutions parts manufacturer. I purchased a window regulator for the back passenger door of the 2001 Dakota SLT that I had bought in February 2024. The regulator that was in the truck broke on the 2nd day I owned it. So that led me to find a replacement. I purchased the replacement about a week later when I had the extra money to do so. I bought it from an Advanced Auto Parts store in Phoenix, Az. Well it's been about a year and the window has maybe been used 6-7 times in total. Each time only partial use. So I went looking for my receipt and the box the part came in. And I found both. Unfortunately anyone who lives in AZ. knows that when it gets hot anything printed on thermal paper tends to just disappear. Well I had the box & receipt in a storage unit. And I have the original manufacturer box,I have the defective Dorman product, & a blank piece of thermal paper. It just so happens that Advanced Auto closed all of their Locations within 150 miles of Phoenix. So I contacted their corporate office and they told me that they would do nothing for me because I don't have the original purchase receipt. Then I contacted Dorman Auto parts Company, they also said their is nothing they can do for me without the original receipt. I understand them not wanting to give a refund to someone without a receipt. Sure I do! I'm Not looking for a refund. I want what I paid for a window regulator for my truck. That I paid the extra money for the 1 that had the lifetime warranty on it. That I DAMN SURE THOUGHT I would get more than 6 partial uses in a single years time. So to anyone who is looking to possibly purchase a part from whatever Advanced Auto don't waste your money to purchase anything from them. They'll just sell you garbage products that are certain to break way sooner then they should. And I also recommend to ""NOT""purchase a DORMAN Automotive aftermarket Part for your car or Truck. They will also sell you just a garbage replacement. If it breaks they will gladly tell you in a polite professional way, to basically fuck off & go away. Every person I know that has been through a summer in Az. & bought anything from anywhere, gets a receipt, it's print will vanish in as fast a just a few days. I sure really miss actual ink printed receipts. Oh! And I truly miss the days when a Manufacturer stood by their products. Because to be Real here, I buy parts from All over the place, local stores, & online businesses & in my experience the odds of you actually getting a well built product from anyone is getting slim. Not just car parts! With products from any business. Businesses just don't give a shit about the person who buys their products.They sure don't care about honesty, pride in their products & what they make, pride in how they do what's right. Or Quality of their products. So Dorman products in my opinion are made to just rob people of their money. Their packaging is flat out LYING to the consumers. The box says 
""PREMIUM ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ QUALITY"". THAT IS FLAT OUT A FALSE STATEMENT! UNLESS THEY ARE REFERRING TO A ""PREMIUM ⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐ QUALITY"" PIECE OF TRASH. It is no question the Business practices of Advanced Auto & the quality of the products they sell, & how they intentionally sell a junk product with a bogus warranty they have absolutely no intention to cover is why they just shut down about 700 locations. So if it's Dorman product or Something from ADVANCED, DON'T TRUST IT TO MAKE IT DOWN THE ROAD OR TO LAST VERY LONG. "

Why would coolant reservoir & radiator be empty when truck hasn't been ran & had no issues with prior to? And what to do?
VEHICLE: 2008 Toyota Tundra TRD off road 5.7L V8 2WD
MILEAGE: around 176,000miles

Truck's starter went out about 2.5 years ago and has sat untouched (outside) waiting to be fixed (Which is NOW!).

Now that fixing it I found that the coolant reservoir is completely empty and from what looks like the radiator empty too (I'm not sure how to properly check & confirm but don't see anything inside it when take the radiotor's cap off.).
I'd check the coolant about a month before it broke down & it was fine, and I didn't have any issues with the truck before it broke down (Outside of it seeming like a delayed start, which now know was starter. Mechanic confirmed.).
So what do I need to do and how do I go about it all? 
Truck's starter hasn't been replaced yet so can't be started just now. But need to try to have everything done & ready so can start truck once starter is replaced as well need to know what else I may be looking at having to do & what will cost me if there is a problem before I invest too much time & money into the truck that I can't afford.

Do I put water in both the radiator & reservoir? And if so how much? Or do I need to fill up with both concentrated coolant & water and just risk losing coolant if it does leak? Then told may have to run it for it to leak, but if the case how did it get empty without running? 
And either way it goes, what could I be looking at having to repair? 

I'm a novice. I know some about cars but not a lot. However am very mechanically inclined & bright, and can usually fix anything with the help of the internet & YouTube lol. And due to finaces I am forced to fix myself and learn more about cars from this experience.

Interpreting CarScanner DTCs
I am looking at purchasing a used car for my university age daughter.  Using CarScanner and a OBDLink MX+ I scanned for DTCs. The output in CarScanner listed a dozen or so “Inactive (Archived)” DTCs. None of them seemed all that concerning. Battery voltage test failed, SRS self test failed, software version invalid, etc. 

I took it as a good sign that there were any codes at all, indicating that the seller had not cleared all of the codes in an attempt to hide a problem. 

I hit the “Export” button and saved the file. 

I got home and took a look at the saved file, and it is listing hundreds of DTCs. A lot of them suggesting issues that are common with this particular vehicle. 

Why would the exported file show all of these codes, but the on screen scan results did not show them?

I seem to recall that when I have cleared DTCs myself in the past, it asks which codes I want to clear. Is it possible that the seller selectively cleared active codes, but left the archived codes, or something to that effect. That doesn’t even make sense to me. Struggling to understand what I’m looking at here and if I should back away from this particular vehicle. "

2008 Mazda 3 Stuck in Second Gear
I’ve got an 08 Mazda 3 (automatic, 2.0L). Mid-drive, the “AT” light came on and the car wouldn’t shift past second gear. AutoZone couldn’t run a diagnostic—said their scanner wasn’t getting power. I’ve already replaced the battery multiple times, and they told me my negative terminal is probably too loose.

A transmission shop told me it’s the valve body and torque converter and quoted me $3,000. I did change the transmission fluid once myself and filled it completely, but that’s it.

Before I go broke, does this actually sound like a valve body + torque converter issue? Or should I be looking at something else?"

Help with my 2012 corolla 1.8
HELP!

Okay so I desperately need some advice on what could be causing my corolla to crank but not start. I know the basics are that it has to be fuel or spark or lack thereof, however this is a special circumstance.  

Here are the details:

Car: 2012 toyota corolla 1.8 
Miles: approx 204,000

Detailed events leading up to the day it would not start:

*replaced headlights with new ones that were aftermarket 

*2 days after replacing headlights, the car completely malfunctions while driving. The car completely shuts off, all the lights light up on the dash and rapidly shut on/off. Got car towed home.

*removed aftermarket headlights and put the old ones back in

*replaced the car battery next day. 

*the next 2 days after replacing battery, the battery light keeps coming on when not pressing on the gas

*then the crank but no start begins

What we have done to try to fix it:

*replaced the fuel pump


*sprayed starting fluid into the fuel intake, car DID NOT start

*had a ""mechanic"" from Facebook come and diagnose the car and he claimed it had to be the new fuel pump was the issue, he said it was getting power to it but no fuel. 

*tested the starter and it is reading at around 12 volts. 


*tested all fuses and relays with a multimeter and they all tested good.


So my question is, does anyone have a solid opinion on what could be the issue?"

BMW e36 320i 2L window repair
Hi all!

Sorry if this isn't the right place, I'll also look for other subreddits.

I've got this issue, pictured, with the rear window of my car. The old window is coming away and the problem is getting worse. 

My plan to repair is thus:
1. Remove old window
2. get a plastic sheet, acetate or something, and impact cement it onto the rim where the old one was glued down
3. Cut it to size with a sharp implement. 

What do we think realistically of this plan? Any better suggestions?

Could gas additive help faulty fuel sending unit?
First time posting and novice at auto repair, looking to learn and save a buck. 

Car is a 2009 Ford Escape Hyrbid 4WD

My gas gauge shows 3/4 with a full tank. Then I got a magic 1/4 tank when almost at empty the other day. My research tells me it’s a problem with the fuel sending unit, maybe the float getting stuck?

Replacing the unit myself doesn’t seem like a beginner friendly diy but I don’t have the $ to drop it at the mechanic. As I understand this issue isn’t dangerous, just shows an inaccurate fuel level reading.

Is there any chance using a fuel additive could help the situation if corrosion were the issue? If so I’d give that a shot.

New battery faulted after a single trip
I picked up a 2013 Ford Focus from a friend after replacing the battery and drive it home.  prior to driving it hope I tried charging the battery and no luck.  The battery wouldn't take a charge.  So I pulled the battery and had it tested at a local auto parts store where it tested bad.  I purchased a new battery and installed it in the car.  The car started without issue so I drove the car home and parked it out front.  Left the car untouched for about a month and when I wet back out to start it and move it around I had the same symptoms as prior to replacing the battery.  No power inside, minimal power when trying to jump.  I put a battery charger on the new battery and it gave me a fault code indicating a battery short.  Took the battery to the local auto parts store where they they tested it and it came up bad battery.

Additional info: the battery had allegedly been replaced by the previous to the previous owner before they started having issues.

Is there anything that I should be looking for that could cause the battery to short out like it did?  I am reluctant to put a $250 battery back in the car if it's just going to short out again."

We frantically tried to get out with adrenaline pumping as if we were trying to rescue our child (because of its importance) & neighbor brought out tow strap trying to help but unable to use vehicle in conditions & 3 adults unable to make it budge from the violent forces of water we gave up. 
At the height of the waters the engine was completely submerge and maybe covered for an hour of the waters reaching the top of hood (but not covering hood completely) and sat in waters for 4 hours where water lines hit right at bottom of windows and probably 3 hours of calmer waters before cleared out. 
Massive contronstruion site overflow nextdoor also caused more sediments in water. 
We hadn't attempted cranking it and raised hood to help dry all. Has been a week now as I was injured from & unable to do myself. And though plumber he's kinda an idiot about cars where im the one who has a engineer mind & after troubleshooting & researching able to fix anything.

No codes on dash but scanner comes up with p0705 transmission range sensor code. Was told previous owner changes a brake light looks like he changed third upper brake light assembly also heard led bulb or broken bulb can cause modules to send wrong information to other systems ei transmission. I suspect either aftermarket car starter or hood pin sensor or overdrive or wires from those going to smart junction box (body control module) is the problem. I heard if you disconnect the wire harness from sjb and check its fuses or unhook the sjb totally you need to reprogram it. Also if I unplug battery and connect battery cables with jumper wire to drain all power I think it resets all modules. Would this reset the sjb and if so would it need to be reprogramed?

Need some help with TIPM replacment. 2010 Jeep Patriot 130k miles
Seemingly at random, when I turn the key, all electronics work, but I get no crank. Zero turnover. Sometimes if I let it sit for a while, it will start. and it will even work for a few days, but randomly Ill get the same no-crank issue and have to have it towed. When it starts, the car runs fine, with no noticeable trans issues.

**Diagonostic Trouble Codes:**

P161B: *Battery Disconnected / TCM Internal*

P0700: *Transmission Control System (MIL request)*

**What I've Done/Tried:**

* Replaced main relays
* Checked battery and cleaned battery post
* Had the TCM inspected and reset at a transmission shop
* Got a new key fob ($300 god damn bucks)

**Questions:**

I've since spoken to a mechanic that I trust. Without him seeing it, he suggested that it might be the TIPM or the starter. Before I explore the starter issue, I want to rule out the TIPM.

**Q1:** Is it advised to replace the whole TIPM, or can I swap out the fuse for the TCM? If just the fuses, where should I look for a new set?

**Q2:** If I am just swapping out a fuse, should I clean all the contacts? If so, with what?

**Q3:** If Im replacing the whole TIPM, is it advisable to go through [https://tipmrebuilders.com/](https://tipmrebuilders.com/)?

**Q4:** Tipmrebuilders has the option to program the TIPM for my make and model. Do I need to have this done or can I skip it?

**Q5:** Is there anything else this could be? Should I explore other options?"

3.2 2019 Ford Ranger turbo oil leak, need advice
Hey, I'm a fairly competent DIY car guy, most complex thing done I've done are head gasket replacements and injector coil & rails.

I've got a 3.2 2019 Ranger, last week I spotted a few tiny oil spots on my driveway and found the source to be the air intake/exhaust recycling side of the turbo. The oil is coming out from the join between the turbo main body and the rotor housing. My feeling is this might be caused by an over pressure in the intake side of the turbo or the rotor housing just needs tightened up a little and the oil came out because I thrashed the engine a little too much when I was late for work one morning. 

I've checked the intake hoses & air filter- no issues. I am capable of replacing the turbo with a new one. I'm just needing advice on what the right thing to do is. Tighten up and monitor for further leaks or replace it as a precaution as I've heard of turbos blowing and spraying metal shards right through the engine via the oil channels? 

Can somebody help? 

Many thanks "

Now second scenario is during winter season if i happened to start the car for the first time like after 10 am this issue would never occur. 

Based on the above two scenarios I thought its related somehow to the cold environment or moisture. Since the issue used to resolve on its own after a few restarts I ignored it.

Now once the rainy season started, the same issue started happening every time it rained or i drove in the rain and it took more restarts for it to get fixed.. when the day wasn't cold or there wasn't any rain it worked perfectly.. now again this seemed to point at something going amiss due to the cold climate/moisture.. but then the question was why did it fix itself after a few restarts.. 

Now comes the wierd part which i happened to discover by chance and then kinda made sense retrospectively of why i discovered the issue in winter/rainy season only..

So when i started the car once i got the issue.. i turned on the AC and restarted the car again with AC being on and doing that it worked to fix the issue.. i thought it was a coincidence for the first time but after repeated incidents i ended up discovering that if normally it took 5-6 restarts to fix the issue.. with AC turned on it took max 1-2 restarts and sometimes if i turned of the AC during the ride the issue would come back and the wheel would become hard. Now it made sense why i discovered this issue during the colder days is becoz I did not turn the AC on first thing in the morning in those days.. and in summer it worked flawlessly since i always turned on the AC first thing..

I took it to the mechanic who tried to check the error on the power steering modulenor something and said it could be issue with it but he was not sure if changing that would resolve it since it tends to get fixed on its own by few restarts/ac being turned on.. i did not have confidence in him and could not buy a new costly part without being sure it will work..

The issue is so weird that it used to happen just once a day in the morning and then never again rest of the day when i started the car again.. so to summarise the issue is somehow related to the cold climate, rain/moisture and wiredly the AC being turned on somehow gives it enough power to fix itself.. I understand nothing about cars and I want some help from the community to understand what this might be since the mechanic isnt confident himself. "

Drivers Front Wheel Bearing rumble
i took the car to tire barn for their inspection and they decided the rumbling when turning right is due to the wheel bearing being bad. so i took it upon myself and did it myself because why would i pay for labor, replaced it and then drove it and it’s still rumbling. it’s a 2016 ford explorer xlt. what else could this be besides the wheel bearing making a rumble when turning right. sounds like driving on a rumble strip. tech also said front right tire needed replaced but none of the others. so he made the conclusion that was also wearing uneven due to the bad wheel bearing. would this potentially be an alignment issue? send help 😂😭

Good options for cars that you can maintain yourself
TLDR; any recs for makes/models that have a good amount of tutorials online for how to do your own maintenance and upgrades 

Hey everyone 1st post here so apologies if I mess anything up here. I’m in the market for a used or cert pre owned but one of the biggest factors that worries me about buying a car is maintenance. 

For background: I had 2 early 2000s 3 series BMWs when I was in my late teens, both of which had incredible maintenance issues. Replaced the engine on the first, transmission issues on the second. I wasn’t a handy guy at all back then so my stepdad basically fixed everything for me as I chucked money at him lol but that ate into my minimum wage savings pretty often. Spent 4 years deployed to Japan so I didn’t have a car for that entire time and since being back in the states I haven’t owned a car, I just daily my work truck every where. Because it’s technically not my car, I try to not abuse it, so I’m not doing any interstate travel with it. That’s pretty limiting unfortunately so I’d like to finally own my own car so that I can be free of the shadiness as well as give myself more flexibility. 

I was an electrician in the navy and am a technician for a tech company now, so I’m decently handy and I can YouTube university myself through most issues lol. That being said, I was hoping some of you might have good recommendations for car makes/models that have a lot of tutorials out there for how to do a lot of your DIY maintenance and upgrades (radio -> car play console type of upgrades). I’m thinking sedans mostly so that I can lift it with a regular regular jack, and makes such as Hondas or Toyotas for the sake of amount of tutorials as well as cost of parts, but if yall have better options or ideas I’d love to hear it. 

I appreciate any and all feedback yall might have for me 🙏"

Car shudders when braking.
Ok so I have changed my brakes and rotors three times within 2 years. When I change them out the shuddering quits for a month or so then its back. I have finally taken this last set off to check the run out on the rotors and the runout is about a .0005 which I think it really good. But the wheel hub runout is inaccurate I think because of the rust build up. I’ve cleaned as much as I can with hub bud and other “deburring” tools. The runout is indeed a bit out of tolerance. Idk if should just switch the hub and bearings out and see what I get from that. Or if there may be another issue I haven’t thought of yet. "

15' Mercedes C300 troubleshoot - AC blowing hot air + ""Stop Vehicle"" message
Hi. I am having a few issues going on with my C300. It has 52k miles and is in great shape however just recently a few issues came up. The shop asks for ridiculously high repair costs so I want to troubleshoot it myself, plus I like to learn new things.  

1. My AC stopped working suddenly. It was blowing very cold air, but one day it just started blowing warm air.  
- I checked the compressor and it is being engaged.  
- The fan behind radiator works. 
- The heater works, hot air is blowing when I bring the temperature up.  
- I scanned it with a SnapOn Solus Ultra scanner and it is showing two codes. I also checked some of the AC functions but I am not familiar with using the scanner so I did not want to cause any damage by using functions which I am not comfortable with.   
- Tried to add refrigerant but the cans gauge was pointing red.  
- Checked the AC pressure. 

The pressure readings are as follows: (pretty much the same with AC off, the low was at 110 PSI)

Low pressure: 105 PSI  
High Pressure: 110 PSI  

Here is a link to the scanner tests pic:  
https://imgur.com/a/rA4054g  

2. While driving, the dashboard is displaying a message. It has been showing for a while.  
- sometimes it's showing in yellow color and the message is ""Stop vehicle. Shift to ""P"". Leave engine running.""  
- other times (very rarely) it is switching to a red color and says ""Stop vehicle. See operator's manual""  

Link to message pics:  
https://imgur.com/a/LjxOujn  

Here are all the codes that the scanner showed:

Why would coolant reservoir & radiator be empty when truck hasn't been ran & had no issues with prior to? And what to do?
VEHICLE: 2008 Toyota Tundra TRD off road 5.7L V8 2WD
MILEAGE: around 176,000miles

Truck's starter went out about 2.5 years ago and has sat untouched (outside) waiting to be fixed (Which is NOW!).

Now that fixing it I found that the coolant reservoir is completely empty and from what looks like the radiator empty too (I'm not sure how to properly check & confirm but don't see anything inside it when take the radiotor's cap off.).
I'd check the coolant about a month before it broke down & it was fine, and I didn't have any issues with the truck before it broke down (Outside of it seeming like a delayed start, which now know was starter. Mechanic confirmed.).
So what do I need to do and how do I go about it all? 
Truck's starter hasn't been replaced yet so can't be started just now. But need to try to have everything done & ready so can start truck once starter is replaced as well need to know what else I may be looking at having to do & what will cost me if there is a problem before I invest too much time & money into the truck that I can't afford.

Do I put water in both the radiator & reservoir? And if so how much? Or do I need to fill up with both concentrated coolant & water and just risk losing coolant if it does leak? Then told may have to run it for it to leak, but if the case how did it get empty without running? 
And either way it goes, what could I be looking at having to repair? 

I'm a novice. I know some about cars but not a lot. However am very mechanically inclined & bright, and can usually fix anything with the help of the internet & YouTube lol. And due to finaces I am forced to fix myself and learn more about cars from this experience.

Car won’t turn over
Last night got back from a week long trip and the car started but sounded a bit iffy. Drove it about 15 minutes back to home and didn’t think much of it. This morning it started up fine and I drove about 20 minutes. I turned off the car and ran a 5 minute errand. Came back and it wouldn’t start. Looked like a dead battery as the display would light up but the engine wouldn’t do anything. AAA gave it a jump and told me the battery was only down 1 volt and didn’t recommend a new battery. I drove home and let it idle another 10 minutes. 

An hour ago I tried to started “just in case” and had the same issues. Another AAA guy came and it was the same 1 volt story. 

2016 CRV, bought certified preowned in January 2020 and it had a new battery as part of the deal. I’m going to let it idle Atleast and hour. What do you think the problem is?"

My sunroof is cracked and after trying to seal it with glass crack repair, I fear I've sped up the life span on my roof.

There are several cracks spanning the entire roof and water keeps leaking into my car when it rains leaving my car smelling like mildew/ moldy. 

The main issue is a replacement will cost over 500$ USD. I have a ton of free time after work so I wanted to try my hand at a self repair so I dont have to go that route. 

Any advice for doing this in a way that will seal the crack and prevent any further cracking?

Low rough idle in drive and reverse when warmed up 04 corolla ce
Has anyone ran into this issue? I just bought and 04 corolla with 55k on it and I notice when the car gets to operating temp, if I come to a stop the idle drops to near 500 and car starts shaking and seat vibrating. The same happens in reverse when at operating temp almost made me feel like I was in a stick shift about to stall but it never stalls

I’ve cleaned the maf sensor, replaced it even but that didn’t work

I changed the spark plugs, cleaned throttle body multiple times, changed pcv valve and hose, breather hoses, both air filters, used fuel injector cleaner in gas tank but nothing seems to fix it. 

No codes

Car won’t start after replacing fuel filter
2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited V8: Car won’t start after replacing fuel filter. I read somewhere that it might have air in the lines. The fuel filter is on tight and not leaking. 
    
I originally replaced it ‘cause it’s very old and had a lot of mileage on it, and I was suspecting it killed my last fuel pump that I had replaced 2 years ago. And also the one that had been replaced a few years prior (I think it’s clogged.) It sometimes hesitates when accelerating when cold. And stalled on me once. It was stalling on the regular 2 fuel pumps ago (new fuel pump fixed that issue). Before replacing the fuel pump a second time it had stalled on me only once and never turned back on. So obviously there’s in an issue with the fuel system and something is giving these fuel pumps a premature death. Which is why I went and replaced the fuel filter just to see if it would fix this issue.
  
    What is the procedure in bleeding the fuel lines or if it’s not air what could be causing the car to not start?"

Need Help Diagnosing a No-Start Issue on My 1983 S10 Blazer - Video Attached!
Hey there, car gurus! I'm not very knowledgeable about car mechanics, but my 1983 Chevy S10 Blazer left me stranded in a business parking lot with a no-start issue. I'm having the car towed home tomorrow morning and could really use your help on what to investigate next. I've attached a video of the engine as I attempt to start the car.

I've already checked the oil and coolant levels, which seem to be normal. I didn't examine the battery thoroughly, but the previous owner had set up a dual battery configuration. I attempted to switch between batteries and even tried running off both, but nothing worked. Any ideas on what could be going on or what I should check next?

2005 Chevy Equinox - Engine heating and Rotor brake sticking
I am looking for help to solve the following two issues. Thank you in advance for your time.

1. When I am driving (even at Highway spped of 70 MPH)  the engine temperature is normal at around 25% of Temp Gage. When I stop with the vehicle in drive say at a traffic stop light or stop sign etc the temperature starts shooting up into the 75%+ of the gage. **<EDIT#1 added since OP- after I switch off the vehicle and take the keys out - I can hear the radiator fan running for about 4 - 6 minutes>** . I got the overheating  - red alert once. I have been cautious since.
2. The front left (driver side) disc brake rotors don't seem to disengage fully causing this rotor to run hot. I have changed the rotors and the brake pads twice. The second time i changed the brake caliper assembly. Both the times I did the brake bleeding and dont have soft brake pedal.

Other than these two issues the vehicle seems to be fine. It has about 145K miles. I would like to keep it for another 3 years.

Battery issues
Last day while I was connecting a battery disconnect switch on my car I noticed some sparks when I touched with my wrench between the negative terminal and chassis. The positive terminal was connected while the negative wasn't (the switch was open).

So I decided to take some measurements with my multimeter (with positive terminal connected and negative terminal disconnected) and noticed that I have 12,8V between the battery's negative terminal and negative battery cable. Also I have a low voltage between the negative battery terminal and the chassis. All voltage goes to zero if I connect the battery terminal to the cable.

Just wanna know if this is normal or if I need to take the car to some specialist. Thanks."

volvo v70 xc trim awd 2002 issue
I got a steal of a deal on my volvo so that I can learn how to work on European cars. Ive learned that most crucial parts need to get programmed and as a software engineer trying to learn how to do it my self the last year without luck, that is specialized in low level hardware programming. That is another thing though I am having issues with my volvo the last 2 months or so after a year. When I got the car I changed oil, plugs and spark plugs immediately. I then got a ob2 code for engine bay o2 sensor and replaced that. Was good for a while and then got the back o2 sensor warning p0132. Replaced that as well with bosh sensors both of them. Cleared for a hot minute but came back immediately; couple of drives. Only thing I can think of is that when I was trying to replace the rear the back o2 sensor harness would not come up easily and trying to pull up from the harness lock broke half of it. Didnt pull on it or anything so it wouldnt come out of the harness plug. I am now getting a p0132 error code even with new 02 sensor after a few months. Though what is of concern is that I got a p2112 error code. I am thinking I should replace the etb on it as  it has lots of miles that a cleaning might do the trick but with 230K plus miles might be better in the long run. I plugged in after I tried to leave and the car got a rough start with erattic idle until warm and then went into limp mode. Couldnt get any power no matter the gas I gave it. I just cleared those codes out and it runs smooth. Though I am getting a little bit more exhaust that I think would be normal from my tail pipe if I give a good amount of pedal. I did just replace the MAF just before clearing that code for p0132. That same code just came up again after resetting. The level of exhaust im seeing and smelling im thinking may be the throttle body. Before I drop that cash im wondering if I am missing something from what I have changed. Im thinking throttle body, hopefully, or cat, wost case. I have put about 7-9K miles and less than 1k since these issues. Batery is new got glass AGM within the last year; top of the line. I am asking because I have never worked on Euro cars just Japanese cars. Trying to figure this out as its my hobby.

2016 Jeep Wrangler JKU overheating
About 6 months ago I was off-roading in the dusty desert then 2 hours later on the highway in traffic my Jeep temperature gauge started going off. After about 30 seconds it went back to normal. I just ignored it and moved on. Of the next couple months if I was sitting in traffic the gauge would go off and then stop after 30 seconds. No issues when I was parked or driving over 50mph. After dealing with this I decided to change the air filter. It was very dirty and immediately I had no more issues. Everything worked perfectly for the next 2 months. I drove a 100 miles this past weekend and when I hit traffic my gauge started going off again. Now I’m back to square one and the gauge goes off every time I go below 50 mph. It eventually adjusts itself back to normal temperature within a minute so it doesn’t seem like that big of a deal to me. Any suggestions on what could be happening? I’m thinking of flushing the radiator if that will help."

Car Alternator: Where to buy alternator from ?
I recently saw the battery symbol on my speedometer screen of the 2007 Toyota Camry XLE. With research found out that the car alternator might need replacement.

I talked to Toyota dealership today and they say the part costs \~550 dollars with 75 dollar core charge. And about 900 dollars if I want to get it replaced at the dealership itself.

On checking online, I was able to find better pricing for the alternator but I am not sure if either the part will fit, or if it is a good idea to go for something not Toyota manufactured.

Would like to understand how risky it would be to buy from Autozone or something and replace the one that I have.

Is it recommended to get the part from the Toyota dealership (even if I decide to replace it myself) ?

&#x200B;

EDIT: I think I should have mentioned this before:  
The car is at over 100k miles.

Also, I cannot drive anywhere for a while because the car battery is currently dead. After I saw the battery symbol on the speedometer screen, I drove the car for over an hour (Obviously, I did not know that alternator issue can make your car shut down in less than 30 minutes)."

Did I Damage My Brand New F-150? Please Help.
Hey folks,

About a year ago, I purchased a new 2019 F-150. Regularly aspirated 3.3 2WD.

I  was changing the oil the other day when I realized my engine air filter housing was not sealed properly. The clamps were down but they were not fully sealed around the housing to make a clean connection. I had to have driven on this for at least 14,000 miles. I am worried that a bunch of debris has gone into my intake. Mind you the gaps in the housing were quite small. If pictures are needed for anyone to diagnose please let me know. Obviously, I resolved the issue as soon as I saw it.

If this did cause some damage what can I do? This is very unlike me and I  am not sure how to handle this. Any help is appreciated. Thanks.

Also, I drive city only, I have not taken the truck on many dirt roads.  Which areas of the engine could this issue have affected?"

Took it home and put some starter fluid into the air intake in the car started right up for a few seconds.

This made me think that the issue was the fuel pump as this was supposedly a common problem with this model car. So he ordered and replaced the fuel pump with an exact fit high-end model, started the car and it started right up. Let it run for a short while then shut it off. I told him to drive around for a while to make sure the battery get recharged so he started it again, exited the neighborhood and the car stalled at the same exact place, after he turned left.

Now he stated once again he heard his toolbox slide and hit inside his truck, there’s no way it could’ve hit the fuel pump itself as that is down underneath the floor of the truck. I looked is the wiring and I did not see any grouting points that could be any relation to it. Check the fuel pump fuse underneath the backseat of the car it was fine. When you turn the key to start can hear the clicking of the relay for the fuel pump, even changed it out with another relay for something nonessential and still no start. The car turns over but does not start. Even tried jumpers to make sure there was enough power and still turnover but no start.

Replace the fuel filter, still no start. So got a fuel pressure gauge and put it at the fuel rail shraeder valve and got zero pressure. Since the car started before and had run, we then jumped to the idea that maybe we got a defective fuel pump when we replaced it since it worked for a short time then had died, so we took it back and got a new one and put it in, Car will turn over, but still no start. Re-checked all the fuses underneath the seat and in the engine compartment, make sure that the relays were in the proper position and alignment. Tested once again with starter fluid into the air intake and again it ran for a short period. 

I’ve got to think that it’s an issue of the fuel pump not energizing. We even took the cover plate off so we could listen to the fuel pump and could not hear it energizing when the key was put into the on or accessory position. Our next step is going to be with a multimeter to check to see if we’re getting the voltage at the fuel pump, but if it’s not I’m kind of stuck of where to go to look to find out where it’s not getting energy from. I’m assuming I should start at the fuse box under the seat where the fuel pump relay and the fuel pump fuse are located. 

Anyone have a diagram of the electrical wiring for the fuel pump? Does it run in the walls of the trunk? Somewhere that the toolbox that I mentioned earlier hitting the wall could have damaged or caused a break? Any ideas would be helpful."

1993 Miata 1.6 Won’t Start On Its Own
I think it might be the ignition Switch, but I’m not sure.  Here’s the situation I’m dealing with:

• Turn Key to Run - all lights come on as they should

• Turn to Start - Lights cut off and antenna goes down like no power at all,

• Release key to run again - lights come back on and antenna comes back up

• I can turn the key slowly to start, engine will crank real slow like a dead battery

• I can jump off car with my Truck (2016 Ram Laramie 5.7 Hemi) but not with my Other car (2008 Versa Sedan)

• Battery Shows 11.67 Volts and I can drive it around when running

My gut says it’s the ignition switch, but curious what y’all might think.  I’m not a mechanic and this is my first project car that I’m trying to learn how to troubleshoot and work on beyond just an oil change and tire rotation.  "

2016 Nissan Rogue window motor problem
Hey! I am having a difficult time finding this part. Our 2016 Nissan Rogue rear driver side window was rolled down and then stopped working with all switches. Other windows are fine. 

We narrowed it down to the motor, removed it and started looking for parts. I thought it would be easy, but there are six pin and two pin options for the same car, and the prices range from decent to over $500. Every time I think I find a matching part online, it’s a two pin connector, when I need a six. The best matches are always the incredibly high priced OEM parts from dealerships. 

I don’t even care about a workout window, I just want the window up, but it won’t stay up without the assembly and motor working. It’s driving me nuts. I’ve posted photos of the whole assembly,  if even the motor alone would be fine. You can see the six pins in the photos.

Thank you in advance for any assistance! I’m in the Austin, TX area."

Car won’t start after replacing fuel filter
2000 Jeep Grand Cherokee Limited V8: Car won’t start after replacing fuel filter. I read somewhere that it might have air in the lines. The fuel filter is on tight and not leaking. 
    
I originally replaced it ‘cause it’s very old and had a lot of mileage on it, and I was suspecting it killed my last fuel pump that I had replaced 2 years ago. And also the one that had been replaced a few years prior (I think it’s clogged.) It sometimes hesitates when accelerating when cold. And stalled on me once. It was stalling on the regular 2 fuel pumps ago (new fuel pump fixed that issue). Before replacing the fuel pump a second time it had stalled on me only once and never turned back on. So obviously there’s in an issue with the fuel system and something is giving these fuel pumps a premature death. Which is why I went and replaced the fuel filter just to see if it would fix this issue.
  
    What is the procedure in bleeding the fuel lines or if it’s not air what could be causing the car to not start?"

09 Prius dilemma
Hey all I’m in a bad way and could really use some advice. 2009 Prius w around 170k miles broke down yesterday. Was driving and it suddenly totally shut down. Pulled over and there was a pretty nasty electrical smell from under the hood. Had it towed to my trusted mechanic and the news was bad. They found a blown fuse and after replacing it the car would start back up but blow the same fuse again within seconds. He suspects the fuse has been out and was meant to protect something more important downstream that has also burned out and that even investigating to figure out what’s wrong could be a lengthy process which could end with it being unfixable. At this point I’m only on the hook for the tow bill. The prognosis by his estimation is that I could spend a bunch of money to discover it’s dead or spend a bunch of money to earn the option to make very expensive repairs. I would be bummed if I was giving up on a car that could be fixed but I really can’t afford to be burning money in the event I just need to get a new car. I’m very not in a good financial situation. 

A second question emerges. Were I to decide to scrap it, what are my prospects for selling it? The engine is doing just fine! Do you think a Prius with an unknown but potential very serious electrical problem would be worth more to a person who does their own work than its scrap value? Thanks for any insights you have!"

Need help
Hey everyone, so I’ve got a 2004 GMC Envoy XUV, I have had it for a year and a half now. So in all that time it has broken down twice. The first time I got it up and running by changing the fluids. I had it running for about a month, then it broke down again. I heard a loud clunk and luckily I had enough momentum to get it to an auto shop just down the road. But now it only goes in reverse and no forward gears at all. I’ve done my research and I’ve come up with 3 possibilities,
1: the drive shaft. It is a rear wheel drive vehicle. So I figured that was a possibility because it’s two wheel drive and the drive shaft would be towards the front. 
2: the gear solenoids
3: the whole transmission needs replaced. 

I’m no mechanic but I do know that there’s a lot of life left in my car. If anyone could let me know please do. Thanks. "

Extractor bit stuck in broken bolt
2006 Honda Element 

Hey everyone. I broke an ignition coil pack bolt while doing a tune-up. The bolt broke flush. Nothing to grab. I drilled a hole in the bolt to fit an extractor bit and now the extractor bit is stuck in the bolt! The drill isn’t grabbing the bit it’s just stripping it. Not sure what to do here. 

Any advice? Seems like I’m in a jam and may have to sell my unborn children to pay for this mess at a shop. 

On the bright side the stuck extractor bit shaft is long enough to hold the ignition coil in place!  To bad I can’t tighten it down somehow. I’d just keep it like that."

Toyota Corolla 2006 won't start, battery/starter were tested to be functional
Yesterday my car wouldn't start, i turn the key and hear nothing. No attempt to turn over, no loud click from the starter, nothing. The lights/radio/etc. did turn on though. The battery was testing low at 12.1V w/ multimeter, so i brought it in to autozone for diagnostic and they say battery is shot, so i replaced battery. Figured this would solve, but then dropped it in and still nothing. So then thought it could be starter. Removed and had it bench tested at autozone, all good and passed. So not starter.

What else could it be? Fuses *looked* fine, but i have no experience checking these. I didn't see any loose/broken wiring connections, but again, no expert there. Autozone guy said it could be failed spark plugs or ignition coil, but my understanding is the car would at least attempt to turn over, not jut get absolutely nothing from turning the key (maybe im wrong). Car is at 118k miles, so is likely time to change spark plugs anyway.

Any idea what this could be or other things i could check? I'm thinking now the dead battery was a symptom, not a cause, but maybe it was just coincidence. We do get down to 30's here in DC area. Thank you for the assistance

EDIT AFTER FIX: In case anyone lands here from Google search here's what the solution ended up being. Turns out this was all caused by a broken bushing in the gear shift connection. [Here's a good YT video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVkyY7AmhfU&list=PLB39dIXiQFSuVPhfgTY7byjrr7U8t8yy_&index=9) that goes through exactly what happened to me. Car was in 1st gear when the bushing broke, so could not shift and was stuck there. Due to the (correctly working) neutral safety switch, the car would not start in 1st gear. I jumped the connection at the starter relay (which bypasses the neutral safety witch), and in 10 seconds of driving, I realized there was a problem with the gears and was able to find the culprit. Easy $5 fix after getting an OEM part at the dealership. "

Dispute with mechanic over cooling problem — Am I being unreasonable?
I'm in the middle of a dispute with a mechanic I've used a couple of times, and before I escalate it, I'd like your read about whether I'm being unreasonable. Slightly long post—sorry, but I want to give you as much info as I can. TL;DR, my mechanic charged me $1,800 to replace my thermostat and water pump, then charged me a second inspection fee and quoted me $1,200 to replace my cooling fan when my car still had the same problem after I brought it home. I think they screwed up the first time and refuse to admit it and, maybe more importantly, have discovered that they may have \*wildly\* overcharged me for the work they did do.

Early last month, I realized my 2018 Nissan Sport Rogue SV was overheating while i was in a drive-thru line -- not redlining, but close. I turned the heat on full blast and managed to get the engine heat down to normal, then took it to a shop I'd used a couple of times. They charged me a $100 inspection fee and then said that my thermostat wasn't opening and my water pump needed to be replaced. They quoted me me $1,813.16 for those jobs. The breakdown according to the repair order was $787.78 for the water pump—$680 for labor, $107.78 for parts—and $693.45 for the thermostat—that’s $98.45 for parts, $595 for labor—plus another $120 for labor to replace the coolant and test-drive the car, $100 for the initial diagnostic, $93.88 in fees, and $18.05 in taxes. (For reference, I'm in the metro area of a fairly major US city—smaller than Chicago, but larger than Portland.) That seemed like a lot, but I paid it—cars are expensive I guess. They do the work and I get my car back.

The second time I drive it—and, importantly, the first time I let it idle—it overheats in the exact same way, except this time I don't notice in time and it's coolant smoking from under the hood, check engine light on, etc. I had had my car back for less than a week at this point. I have it towed back to the shop and tell them what happened. They look at it and send me a new quote: $1,200 to replace the cooling fan, plus \*another\* $100 inspection fee.

I'm a little surprised by this. I ask the manager if her position is that the previous work they did was necessary, and she says yes. I tell her I have a hard time believing that—that would mean that my thermostat, water pump, AND fan all went kaput at same time. She sticks to her guns. I also tell her that I feel I shouldn't have to pay them a second inspection fee when I paid them one a week ago and they failed to find the problem with my car.

She says, essentially ""it's not our fault we didn't catch it, because the fan was working fine when we looked at it."" I responded that I had a very, very hard time believing that -- they're telling me that my broken thermostat and water pump were making my car overheat, and then coincidentally, immediately after I got the vehicle back, the fan went out and and made my car overheat in exactly the same way. I tell her that I think it's much more likely their techs didn't test my car properly—if I had to guess, they drove it around the block and never let it idle—and that I'm having my car towed to another shop.

When I drop my car off at the other shop (a location of a regional chain of auto shops—I basically just picked the closest shop to them with decent reviews), I ask them to do me a favor and give me a written quote for replacing the thermostat and water pump. Their quote: Just under $800. It broke down to a $60 inspection fee, $180.02 for the thermostat, $552.94 for the water pump, parts, labor, and tax included.

My jaw dropped when I saw that — I understand prices vary, but this was less than half of what I paid. I went in and went over my invoice from the first shop line by line with the person at the front desk. They said that while the first shop had charged me pretty standard prices for parts, the labor costs were, and here I quote, ""crazy."" In particular, they charged me \*triple\* just in labor costs for the thermostat what the other shop would have charged for parts, labor, and tax.

I thought I had missed something, especially since the first shop's quote for the fan was pretty close to what the second shop quoted me for the same job—maybe $150 or $200 higher, but not that different. Maybe I had just happened to walk into the world's most affordable mechanic. So to double-check, I called the local Nissan dealership's service department and asked them to give me a quote to replace the thermostat and water pump. Going by their service manual, they quoted me $1,043 before tax; while they said they couldn't guarantee that would be exactly what I would pay, it should be within $100 of it.

I'm kind of at a loss here, but I also consider myself to be a pretty reasonable person—I'm not the kind of customer who complains a lot—and before I go complain publicly about this shop, I want to do everything I can to make sure I'm in the right. I'd like to get a few actual mechanics' takes on this. My questions:

1. **Does their explanation of my problem—that my thermostat and water pump broke pretty much simultaneously, and that my cooling fan was working when they looked at it and crapped out days afterward to cause the same problem, ring true for you?** I understand none of you have looked at my car, but I'd like your gut opinion. Is this the kind of simultaneous failure something you see a lot? (I didn't ask for the parts they pulled back or I would test them myself.)
2. **Regarding what they billed me, is there a reasonable explanation that you can see for why they charged me so much?** I considered the possibility that maybe something was stuck—they had to drill out a bolt or something like that, and the second shop quoted me so much less because they didn't see that—but they didn't mention anything out of the ordinary and either way, I can't see that doubling or nearly doubling the price.
3. **I'm asking them to refund the second inspection fee and match the price that the dealership quoted me. Is that a reasonable ask, from your perspective?** I'm very, very skeptical that they'll actually give me any of my money back, but this shop has been professional and, I think, honest with the jobs I've had them do before—though from what I've gathered, they may have been under different management back then—and I want to offer a resolution before I go on Yelp or Google or wherever and tell my neighbors I wouldn't trust them to fix my lawnmower. Obviously they have the right to set the prices they see fit, but I've never used an independent shop that charged me more, or that much more at least, than a dealership."

Car getting power with no key, doesn't start after coil wire replacement.
Just had valve cover replaced along with a coil wire in my '05 Toyota Solara. I ran a few errands and now it won't turn over or start but the power is permanently on. Even the windows work, check engine light on, battery light on, oil light on, but everything is maintained.

I called my mechanic and one of his guys who did the work answered. Just told me to try to jump it (haven't yet) and told me it could be unrelated. 

The car has 247,000 miles on it but it's been babied. I just put in a new alternator, struts and I have a record of every oil change each 3,000 miles. 

I thought to clean the terminals, but it's obviously getting power, just not starting. Battery is fairly new and I broke down at an Advance lol. Tested the battery and it was giving inconclusive readings and said check connections.

I'm going to ask someone for a jump to see if that works. Any ideas?

Thanks and have a great weekend!

Car Mechanics please help
A few days ago I was driving to a gig .( just moved to Dallas from AZ so doing ging work). I didn't have the cap on my radiator on properly.  While driving all the fluid flushed inside my hood,my air intake all over engine etc...

I pulled over. Once cool I added emergency water from a (5 qquart oil jug( all I had and cleaned as much as possible).. 

It started up the next morning fine.. however it started having problems with acceleration... eventually it started but could not move... after putting most my money into a fuel pump I got it moving again. At first start up it was fine and got to 80mph ( needed to move to a Walmart in irving 5 mils from where it broke down so I could book a gig for tommorow and nake 150 to use towards what I thought was changing burnt oil from bad fuel pump, changing spark plugs( possible still misfire having hard time assecelrating)...

It started losing power coming off the frewway  whit smoke started pouring out of where my AIRFILTER connects to the engine,  none coming out of the exhaust... I'll attach a picture so u can see where.. any experienced car people please let me know what this may be.. it seems like there is something wrong with the air intake system.... And that might make sense for the reason for decrease the acceleration in a hard time getting to speed, oxygen fuel mix etc..

I would really appreciate the input because I need this car in order to survive, Hoping that I can get to this gig tomorrow. A little later I'll try moving it to a walmart parking lot from the complex it's in.. I'll be able to donate plasma tomorrow and hopefully work this gig which I'll be paid hopefully by Thursday,  I can also donate again Thursday and a friend is gonna meet me Wednesday to give me 40, so guaranteed 110 dollars to work on this and if I can work this gig . 220...

Please any experienced mechanics please provide input , and anyone wanting to have fun off my expense ,feel free to comment as well.. ,this is reddit lol. Thank you all and have a great day."

2 Months to install previously-owned transmission in 2002 4x drive Rav4? Supply chain issues?
Hello, please forgive me if I'm getting some terms wrong here. I wanted to see if the situation I'm dealing with is reasonable given the current supply chain issues or if I need to get out of it somehow.

My gf's car (2004 Rav 4, 4 wheel drive) broke down. The transmission was shot and needed to be replaced. I had to get it towed to a mechanic within our AAA plan's 3 mile radius of where we broke down (same city but not that close to us). I found a place on Yelp that had the best reviews in that area, but this was not our normal mechanic that we usually go to.

The mechanic told me he would replace the transmission with a previously owned one. He did say that this method could take awhile but he made it seem like it'd be a few weeks at most. When we factored in current costs of used cars, plus the fact the the engine had been replaced, we decided to do that instead of buying a different used car that might have just as many problems, if not more. Money's tight with us so this was basically our only option, obviously if we could afford a newer car we'd do that. 

This was 2 months ago! We have been waiting and every time I call him, it's something else. He's saying that finding parts for this car has been difficult because it's 4 wheel drive. First we had to wait a few weeks for the transmission to show up and be installed, then it was ""This bearing didn't work so we needed to track this down"". Then it was ""another part didn't work."" Now, supposedly, the car can drive except that there's some problems with the transmission computer, it doesn't run smoothly so we need to replace that. Called yesterday and ""that part didn't work right so we had to send it back"" or something like that.

I basically told the guy that this was unacceptable, that I understood supply chain is tough right now but that we'd need the car back one way or the other. He got defensive and was saying that he really didn't want to leave the job unfinished because he wouldn't get paid in that case. I asked when he thinks the next part would come in and he could have it running and he said that Friday he'd be able to test the new part and it'd hopefully work then.

I want to know if this stuff is reasonable given the current supply chain issues or if I need to just get the car out of there. I feel bad because he's (supposedly) already lost money on the job but at this point I don't think that's my problem.

Any advice at all would be very much appreciated.

Thanks!"

Is my mechanic being honest?
Hey all I've come to seek advice. Recently my truck (1992 s10 4wd) broke down. They said my starter was bad and my alternator was bad as well. I believe both of these. However upon receiving my vehicle back they told me my ball joint was bad and they'd have to call me with an estimate later. They told me that if the ball joint was bad that probably meant the rest of the front end was bad and that'd be 1000 to replace all of the parts. Should I start saving or does anyone here have any other opinions?

Could Ford have messed up something in my car?
So my car has been making some weird grinding noises recently and one day it broke down while I was out at the store. I had it towed to Ford, and it turns out it was just a dead battery but I do need a new clutch. 

I picked up the car today after just getting the new battery and now the AC doesn’t work at all. It is completely hot air, not even a second of cool. Is it possible that the Ford mechanics messed up the AC while giving me a new battery and looking at my clutch? If not, what do you think is going on?"

2015 Chrysler Town & Country Transmission repair/replace Help!
My mini van broke down a few days ago.  I was in a high traffic area and not able to accelerate. I had to turn the engine off completely and restart it to get it moving again. I coasted into an NTB and they plugged it up to their check engine light reader. They said it was giving multiple transmission codes. They said they couldn’t do anything else for me and I had it towed to an AAMCO the following morning. AAMCO is telling me I need an entire new transmission and it will cost $4,000.  My van has 84,000 miles. How is this possible? Also, should I get other opinions from other mechanics? I’m always afraid I’m being taken advantage of.  My other concern is that there was a recall on my year and model transmission pump, but my VIN was not included in the recall. If this is the same exact problem, do I have a case to have Chrysler pick up the tab??

Car won't start after starter and fuel pump replaced.
Location: Louisiana

I was traveling out of town, 5 hours away from home. I went to the store to grab a few things as I was staying in my camper at a nearby campground. When I went to the car to go back, the car would not start. I turned the key, and no noise wouldn't crank, nothing. I thought it was the battery. I called roadside assistance, and they jumped it off. I was able to make it back to my camper, but the car would only go 30 miles an hour. Thankfully, I was only a mile away. I let the car run for about 30 minutes, thinking that the battery would charge up the more it ran. Well, after I turned off the ignition and let it sit for about an hour, I tried to start it. Same thing as before, it wouldn't start, no noise, nothing. I called a tow truck and had it delivered to Firestone Auto Center about 8 miles away. I spoke to them to confirm they received it and was told they did and would keep me updated on the status of my repair. They called me the next day and said it was the starter, and it would cost around $700. Told them to fix it and was told it would be ready later that day. I didn't hear back from them. Called the next morning, was told they didn't have time to work on it but would start that day. I reminded them that I was stranded without a ride and was 5 hours away from home. They finally called back later that afternoon, stating they replaced the starter, but now the fuel pump needs to be replaced and would cost $1800. Told them to fix it. They called 24 hours later stating that they replaced the fuel pump, but it didn't fix the issue, that its a computer issue, and they don't have the equipment to repair it. They said I would still have to pay them $700 even though they can't fix it. Does it sound like I am being ripped off. Should I even pay them anything? What should I do? I'm stranded out of town with my mother and son. Just 2 women and a child."

Is my 2018 Kia Forte LX 2.0L done for?
So, my 2018 Kia Forte LX 2.0L started having issues a couple months ago. It started stalling irregularly, but would start right up again. Still starts right up. Then came the rattle and it stalls quite often now, I have about 10 minutes before it will stall and then is almost impossible to drive. No check engine light for a couple of months. Finally, it stalled a bunch and then the check engine light came on and I got 2 codes, one was P0011 and the other was P0366. For those familiar with these codes I don't have to explain them too in-depth. One is for camshaft position sensor and the other correlates to the VVT solenoids. Both of these codes popped up at the same time. When the Kia initially started acting up I thought it was the alternator because my battery was at low voltage when started. Like 12 volts and I believe it should have been between 13-14 at the very least (with the car started of course). I just bought a brand new car battery and the voltage read the same so I know it's not the battery. Checking the timing and messing with the timing chain is a last resort for me also as I am not that experienced with timing belts and chains. I'm extremely worried my car is toast because while researching I found a few people with the same issues and codes and their cars had head damage and needed the engine replaced even after they replaced all of the same parts I'm about to to replace. I don't have the money to have full diagnostic testing and repairs, but can still afford these parts and replace them myself. I also finance and still have alot left to pay on the car. I have had the car for 3 years and have not been the best with oil changes. No warranty. I haven't tried to drive it since the last time it died on me but I'm worried there was damage to the engine. Should I try to replace the parts and have oil change and see what happens? I'm worried I'll be out money and a car. Does anyone have experience with this particular issue or have the same issue? Any help or advice would be greatly appreciated!"

Do You Accept Parts From Outside of Your Shop?
Say a customer ordered an alternator  from Amazon and wanted you to install it, does your shop allow this? I'm just curious if this is customary or not? I personally wouldn't for liability and warranty issues but I'm just curious for a reason I'm not at liberty to discuss. Sorry to be vague here. "

We just realized recently there is 0 air or heat coming out of the passenger middle and rear vents. I was able to get the emergency kit tray off and it seems like the rear blower is working. I also checked my interior air filter and it seems decent and the blower fuses are not blown. So all the vents work in the front and the left and the air blows cold.

2015 Honda CRV - intermittently wont start
Hi,
My 2015 crv is a push button start. 
Until 2 days ago, I had never had any issues issue with my vehicle. 

The car would not start. I noticed that it would go into accessory mode. When I tried to start it, a bunch of lights would flash and it was clicking and making a sort of alarm sound.
My check engine light is not on. 

I got a jump start and drove to Walmart for them to check the battery. I had purchased it there 2 years ago, and it is noted to be a 3-year battery. 
They said the battery was ok.
The starter was ok.
The alternator was ok.

The guy said that maybe my key was too far away. It’s always kept in the passenger seat inside of my purse. He said if it happens again to put the key closer. Seemed pretty unlikely but ok, I’ll try. 
It happened again last night. Flashing lights on the dash when I tried to turn it on. 
Moving the key closer did not work (not surprised, but still…)

Surprisingly, it started this morning! And then wouldn’t when I needed to come back home. 

Mechanics are closed on the weekends here. 

Does anyone have any thoughts on what might be wrong?

Issues with how my car responds to the gas pedal
Hello, I'm having issues with how my car responds to the gas pedal.
It's a 2000 Nissan Almera, 1.5 Petrol, Manual transmission.

When I press the gas pedal gently, the tachometer goes up normally, and the car sounds normal up until around 1800rpm, then it starts bouncing between 1500 and 1800 rpm, even though my foot stays steady.

If I press the pedal harder, it doesn't climb past 1800-2000 like it should, instead, it oscillates faster in that same range (1500-1800). Only when I press the pedal much harder, it suddently jumps over 4000rpm.

It feels like it gets stuck or has resistance, and this issue is noticeable mostly in neutral or first gear.
This makes driving in traffic very uncomfortable because the car jerks back and forth, as if it cant find a steady throttle imput.

I have been to 3 mechanics and one electrician and neither of them could find the cause of the problem. 
Maybe you guys have any ideas? 
I'll attach a video for you to better understand the problem."

Rough Idle, stalling after TX emission inspection
Hello, 

I did my emission test for TX yesterday on my 2011 Mazda 3s (manual). After I picked up the car, it was stalling when stopping. When I tried to get going from a stop the rpm would drop and car stall. It was also cutting power on acceleration. No engine lights came on but TCS was on.  It was a mess...

Drove back to auto shop to ask them to take a look and while trying to convince them the procedure did something to the car (which they didn't...), seems like the issue got resolved. Started the engine and everything was fine. 

  
What could have causes this? My guess would be that the OBD scanner reset something on the engine settings.

Toyota Aygo 2010 indicators only work when held down….
Other issues with the car include: Heater working but aircon doesn’t blow out cold air, more like a fan. I also think there’s an issue with the radio with it not fully reacting when I press the volume buttons. I think I may have fixed this however with the fuse being replaced. 

I’ve tried to replace the fuses for the relevant issues with the car for the air-con and indicator related issues but that did not turn out successful. 

The answer for the indicator fix will most likely be to replace the stalk but I’ve watched YouTube videos and I just don’t rly feel confident to attempt it myself based off what I saw. But the car is a piece of junk and probably not even worth the cost of replacing the stalk. So I’m looking for possible other options to try that people may know. Even if it’s just a temporary fix. 

Thanks!

2002 Highlander power steering suction connection leak help
Power steering pump replaced by mechanic, 5 months later discovered a drip from the suction line at the connection. I am assuming the Oem connection was used with the aftermarket pump.

I tried tightening a little more and a little more. I never felt like I was applying too much force,  it felt the bolt was turning more than it should.

I tried replacing the o ring, had the same drip.

Went to tighten a little more and the bolt head snapped off.

What do you think the likelihood is that the suction connection is the issue?

If I remove the broken bolt with a reverse bit, and replace that connector ($40-50). Would this maybe cure the leak?

Or is it just a defective aftermarket pump and I’m stuck replacing the pump?

Just not sure if it’s worth tiring the broken bolt removal and changing the connection."

2012 Toyota Sienna XLE Issues
Hey there!
I was hoping that I could get some help with my Sienna. My air conditioning works but doesn’t work well. The inside doesn’t cool down all the way and the ac gets cold only when I’m driving and the car is moving, not when I stop or idling. 
I had a bunch of work done in January and I asked the mechanic to check my cooling system, their team said there was nothing they could see that would cause this issue. I spent a lot of money there and want to be as prepared with information as I can be.
The car is not overheating at all the engine temp is always right in the middle where it should be. There is not refrigerant leak, it measures as full, I have recently replaced the air filter. 
The other day I started it and it was making a decent amount of noise. I have a video attached, hoping someone can help make an educated guess with what information I provided above and the sound in the attached video.

Help with my 2012 corolla 1.8
HELP!

Okay so I desperately need some advice on what could be causing my corolla to crank but not start. I know the basics are that it has to be fuel or spark or lack thereof, however this is a special circumstance.  

Here are the details:

Car: 2012 toyota corolla 1.8 
Miles: approx 204,000

Detailed events leading up to the day it would not start:

*replaced headlights with new ones that were aftermarket and/or somewhat questionable 

*2 days after replacing headlights, the car completely malfunctions while driving. The car completely shuts off, all the lights light up on the dash and rapidly shut on/off. Got car towed home.

*removed aftermarket headlights and put the old headlights back in

*replaced the car battery next day. 

*the next 2 days after replacing battery, the battery light keeps coming on when not pressing on the gas

*then the crank but no start begins

What we have done to try to fix it:

*replaced the fuel pump

*sprayed starting fluid into the fuel intake, car DID NOT start

*had a ""mechanic"" from Facebook come and diagnose the car and he claimed it had to be the new fuel pump was the issue, he said it was getting power to it but no fuel. 

*tested the starter and it is reading at around 12 volts. 


*tested all fuses and relays with a multimeter and they all tested good.


So my question is, does anyone have a solid opinion on what could be the issue?"

When your car is idling and revving poorly.
Why I am writing this is that I asked AI about unstable idling and poor acceleration in a petrol car and received a number of suspects but not the real cause.

It mentioned possible vacuum leak, sensor issues and even fuel pump and injector issues. What it failed to mention was the ""ignition coils"" and spark-plugs.

In our case, it turns out it was a bad ignition coil. "

Background info. 185000 kms We have had this car 10 years. It had the faulty Hyundai motor but they replaced it for free at 85000 km. About 2-3 times a year when it’s started it starts and then the rpm drop until it almost stalls. I usually hit the gas peddle to get the rpm’s back up and it’s never been an issue. Last Friday at a light it shut its self off. I put it in park and then it fired up again. "

‘17 Honda Civic LX (102k), atrocious fuel efficiency, how to address?
This vehicle showed no computer codes whatsoever. I had it checked independently with a two-day 140-point inspection with a trusted (80-year-old) independent repair shop I use. There was next to nothing wrong; just a splash guard under the engine, and the battery was a little weak, which was addressed.

Despite my driving in hyper-mileage style, barely touching accelerator unless absolutely necessary (coasting to red traffic signals, driving no more than 55 on the freeway) the car (driving in ECO mode) is getting between 20.2 to 22.6 miles per gallon, which is the ridiculous for a Honda Civic.  I *accidentally* performed one of my fuel trials in REG driving mode; it is getting 16 mpg in regular driving mode.

I’m not unreasonable. I don’t expect a used 8-year-old car to perform to brand-new manufacturer specifications….but it’s not even in the same ballpark. If it were a couple of miles lower or something, yeah, that would be acceptable, but this is 40% less than the manufacturer's specifications in terms of fuel efficiency. No, I wasn’t promised that, but this is way out of bounds.

 A shop replaced the spark plugs. I drove it for a few days. That did not affect fuel efficiency.

They then sent it to the Honda dealership, which recommended (some kind of) valve job/maintenance, which is now being performed at a separate shop.

Aren’t there mechanics who can diagnose things anymore, OTHER than or beyond those that show up in OBD codes?  

Are the items below reasonable things to check? Can things like these be misperforming yet not throw any errors? **Can** they be ""checked"" in any way, absent any error codes?

Are there other possible causes to check? Can mechanics diagnose things that aren’t showing OBD codes?  

**Faulty Oxygen (O2) Sensors**

• Causes incorrect fuel-air mixture readings, leading to excessive fuel use.

**Malfunctioning Mass Air Flow (MAF) Sensor**

• Misreads air intake, affecting fuel delivery.

**Ignition Coils**

• Poor combustion leads to more fuel needed for the same power output.

**Dragging Brakes or Alignment Issues**

**CVT (Continuously Variable Transmission) Issues**

• A slipping or malfunctioning CVT can reduce efficiency significantly."

Car made white/grey smoke from the hood, pulled over, and oil was everywhere under the hood
Mercedes CLK 320 W208, '97

I was driving, accelerated quite quickly because my sister found it funny. Stopped a stop sign, and accelerated again when I started again. I looked into my mirrors and I saw white/grey smoke, and realised it was from my car. It took me a minute to find a place to pull over. When I did, I opened the hood, and saw oil everywhere. It clearly came from between the engine and the radiator, not from the sides of the engine. No noise was heard, no big clunk, maybe the engine revving hid the noise though, but I don't think so.

I changed ATF a week ago, and was worried I put too much oil in, but the colour wasn't the same, and it didn't come from the transmission pan or the hole where you put ATF in.

It's now waiting for a garage to be transported to, so I don't know when I'll have a diagnosis, but could use some first ideas on whether or not that's a serious and expensive issue ( but I bought a 30yo CLK 320 so expensive repairs will be my life for the next few years )

What could it be ? Do you have any idea based on the oil in the pictures or how it happened ? My dad tends to think it might be an overheating issue. Electronics on this car tend to fall apart lol, so maybe there's an issue with the engine temp not being properly read or calculated, which ends up with the radiator not doing its work ? But I'm 80% sure I checked the temp gauge during this trip and it was barely over 80°C, maybe 90°C ? which is a bit more than normal, but the last few days have been hotter than usual

P0420 Typical Fixes Not Resolving Issue
I have a 2016 Kia Sorento 2.4L with 160K miles. Originally, a P0420 code came on. I did the typical fixes to resolve this but things have only gotten worse. Any recommendations help would be *greatly* appreciated! 

I replaced my catalytic converter (after market), downstream O2 sensor (OEM), and upstream O2 sensor (OEM).

Despite these replacements, after clearing the codes and driving around, the vehicle would go into limp mode and scanner would read:

* P0420, Catalyst efficiency low (Bank 1)
* P0172, System too rich (Bank 1)
* P0038, HO2S Heater Control Circuit High (Bank 1 Sensor 2)

I don't know if this ""limp mode"" is a feature to allow the vehicle to move safely when it has problems or if they are actual symptoms of issues with the car, but it will:

* Struggle gaining speed/power in general. This has gotten worse over time. This was really the original symptom and the P0420 code came on at this time.
* Struggle gaining speed at all from a stop (no issues yet moving out of Park after starting up). It will try to limp forward and either eventually die or start moving, albeit without the speed it should have. Over time, this has gotten worse.
* Struggle shifting gears. This also has gotten worse over time to the point where I drive in ""manual mode."" It won't really go into 6th gear and barely goes over 50 when the road is flat
* Struggle on any incline and looses speed when on inclines

**Prior to this issue:**  I replaced my starter which involved removing the intake manifold. I did not replace the gaskets like I probably should have; however, they looked like they were in good shape to me. The P0420 code came on a few weeks after replacing the starter.

**Something Went Wrong:**

Trying to figure out what the problem is I did the following:

* Back probed the Upstream O2 Sensor signal wire on the harness side to see what the reading was. I didn't get a good reading.
* Opened and inspected my PCM connectors, blew off the dust, and reconnected them
* Noticed there was no fuse in the ECU 3 slot, Injector Driver Box, and put one in there. I am 99% sure there has never been one there, but since the diagram showed a fuse in that spot, I figured I might give this a try. I think this was a mistake possibly.
* Tested the continuity on all fuses while in the fuse box. 
* Disconnected and reconnected my Upstream O2 Sensor connector

After doing this, 16 codes came on when I started up. The vehicle shuddered and misfired, then died. Yay. I'm not sure what part of any of the above caused this. I reset the computer and currently have ""only"" 8 codes which are:

* **P0420**: Catalyst system efficiency below threshold (Bank 1)
* **P0172**: System too rich (Bank 1)
* **P0038**: HO2S heater control circuit high (Bank 1, Sensor 2)
* **P0222**: Throttle/pedal position sensor/switch B circuit low
* **P0123**: Throttle/pedal position sensor/switch A circuit high
* **P0193**: Fuel rail pressure sensor A circuit high
* **P0335**: Crankshaft position sensor A circuit
* **P0303**: Cylinder 3 misfire detected

**Current Situation:**

I checked all the fuses by pulling them out one by one and testing continuity on ohms. They all seem good except one that was a little sketchy going to the PCM (eventually it read 0 ohms so it was probably fine) and I swapped it out. I checked the pins on the PCM and none were bent.

I started the car without the Upstream O2 Sensor connected (why? I'm not sure, mostly forgot it was disconnected). Engine started, no shuddering, no misfires that I could tell. It still had the same 8 codes. There was an additional pending P0030 but it went away.

I cleared the codes and started again with the Upstream O2 Sensor connected and still no shuddering or misfires, but and still all 8 codes.

Since my engine wasn't spazzing out (yet), I sprayed the sealed areas with carb cleaner and didn't hear any rev in the engine at all. I'm not sure how good of a test this is, but seems like things are not catastrophically unsealed at least.

My next courses of action are:

* Double check the wiring harness, sensor connections, loose ground cables, and test ground points
* Test sensor connectors (throttle position, upstream O2, crankshaft, fuel rail pressure)
* Disconnect exhaust downstream of the cat
* If all those check out...test ECM (not sure how but I'll find out)

Any other recommendations?"

Torque wrench issues
Today I did my first shock assembly replacement. I tried to be very particular and do everything right so I got a torque wrench from O'Reilly's loaner program where I also got the shocks. The installation went fine until it came to torque everything. The largest bolts behind the breaks were supposed to be 81 ft.lb and the torque wrench worked as expected. The top bolts for the strut mount were supposed to be 33 ft.lb and this is where my inexperience (and tired brain) messed me up. The torque wrench wouldn't limit out on the drivers side and I thought maybe the shocks were just gapped a little more than I thought. It didn't feel right so I went to the passenger side and that's where I broke the bolt. I don't think the torque wrench was working correctly and looking back I probably shouldn't have used it for only 33 ft.lb or continued tightening, clearly. Anyway, O'Reilly's warranty is covering a new shock for the passenger side.
*My question is, I am fairly confident I overtightened the drivers side strut mount. Should I loosen the nuts, leave it as it is, or replace it?"

1.2 TSI (CBZ) runs perfect cold, revs at 90°C, won’t start when warm – no fault codes
Hi all,
I’ve been trying to diagnose a frustrating issue on my 2011 Seat Leon Mk2 1.2 TSI (engine code CBZ) for the past two months. Hoping someone here can help or has seen this before.

The problem:
	•	Car runs perfect from cold, no issues up to 89°C
	•	As soon as it hits 90°C, the revs surge or become erratic
	•	If I switch it off at 90°C, it cranks but won’t restart
	•	After letting it cool down (20–30 mins), it starts again like nothing happened
	•	No check engine light, and no stored fault codes (even after the issue)

What’s been done so far:
	•	O2 sensor replaced
	•	Crankshaft sensor replaced
	•	Coolant temperature sensor (CTS) replaced
	•	Throttle body cleaned
	•	Cooling fans work properly
	•	Timing belt and water pump recently replaced

Other symptoms:
	•	Once it hits 90°C and the issue starts, it may crank and fire weakly but dies after a few seconds
	•	One time it restarted but had no throttle response (like limp mode)
	•	Happens consistently, no matter how gently I drive it

Suspected camshaft sensor — seems like a classic heat-related failure, but I’d like a second opinion before I replace it.

Anyone seen this on the 1.2 TSI (CBZ engine) before?
Is there anything else I should check first?"

BMW 128i 2009 (Fault Codes) car repair help
This was what the autozone code scanner gave me. Any gurus know what the issue is? I checked all the fuses and the battery seemed fine.

I was on a trip from Huntsville, Texas back home about a 2hr30min drive. When my dash gauges kept flickering on and off. The ABS light kept flickering on and off. And i would lose a noticeable amount of power to the throttle. Also the break peddle was able to be pressed all the way to the floor. "

I need a mechanic's knowledge for a timing belt issue.
I am changing the water pump in my 2001 Honda CRV. I have to remove the timing belt to get to it. In several videos, it showed how to mark things to make it easier to put back together. And they said to notice the two tiny notches and how they are lined up together. but mine are not. they are about 4 teeth off. 

What is up? The car seemed to be running fine--- except that it was quickly streaming out. Thanks for any advice. "

2001, Nissan Xterra, 3.3L V6
A few months ago my car had some issues while i would be sitting in park, it would just start like buffering a little bit, shaking a little, and then one day while i was in a turning lane, it just completely shut off. I ended up taking it to shop and it was the “distributor” i had replaced, maybe a fuel pump distributor if that’s a thing? It just says “distributor” as the part replaced on my paper. That was about 3 months ago. Today, i had driven to a store, got back in my car and was sitting there maybe 5 mins with my car on and it started shaking like i have never felt it shake, the first part of the video shows how it’s shaking my gear thing and it is shaking everything so bad i could even feel it in my seat and the shaking only stopped when the car shut off. I noticed my rpm was going up and down as well and i recorded that in the second half of video. I could literally see the heat coming out of my engine, not sure if it’s because it’s hot today or if that’s normal, but it freaked me out so i just turned the car off. When i turned it on again a couple mins later, the bad shaking happened again, rpm bouncing, and then it shut off on its own. This happened multiple more times. I left it in the parking lot and got a ride home, any idea what this could be? "

2007 CBR600RR clutch not disengaging after rebuild — cover/pushrod issue?
I rebuilt the clutch on my ‘07 CBR600RR (used inner basket, new steels/frictions, and springs), but now the clutch barely disengages. The bike still wants to roll in gear with the lever pulled, and the actuator arm sits kind of high at rest (around 11 o’clock). The clutch cover used to be tight and pop on, but now it just slides on too easily. The pushrod has a bit of play once installed, and I can hear a slight difference when I pull the lever while the bike’s running — like it’s making contact, but not doing enough. Anyone know what might be off?"

Trying to diagnose  left tire issue
Trying to diagnose a possible brake issue, or maybe something with the control arm or suspension?

To start, I am by no means a car person, and my knowledge is limited in that regards, so forgive me if my information is , well….stupid lol

I have a 2014 ford c-max, 144k miles on it.  The back brakes started making some squeaking/groaning noises when letting off the brake. It was already time for a brake pad change, so I did some research on how to do it myself and got the tools for it. Passenger side (right) was easy and no issue. Drive side (left), made some fairly loud creaking when jacking it up (and again when back down). Tire was also stuck on so had some difficulty getting it off. The tire itself was also VERY worn on the inner shoulder and also looked like it had some cupping going on. When lowering the car back down, left side again had some loud creaking/popping going on ,and also creaking when putting lug nuts back on.  Beyond the brakes, what else might be causing this issue that I should look into?

(And yes, I jacked it from the propper jack points and used jack stands)"

Can K-Seal damage your engine?
Hello, I’m working on a 2019 Dodge Grand Caravan GT. 

When driving uphill the coolant will raise in temperature from the halfway mark to one tick above it (5/8 total travel through gauge).

I am tracking down the reason for change in temperature. I have replaced the thermostat and am currently doing a coolant flush (it has orange coolant in it now and I have purple coolant, specifically made for the make and model).

My thought process is to flush out the improper coolant by draining and refilling multiple times. I have distilled water to assist the process in case the reason the old fluid is orange is due to radiator rust and to give a large quantity of flushing fluid.

However I am nervous that my cooling issues (no leaks or coolant quantity issues currently noted) could be due to a blown head gasket.

If I add k seal to the coolant, would it potentially damage the engine? Or should I add it just to be on the safe side? (It says it’s safe on the packaging but I want the communities advice).

Thanks for the help!

EDIT- thank you both for the help and replies! Over the course of the day I replaced the thermostat, radiator cap, and performed a coolant flush/replacement. I just did a test drive and it seems the issue is solved! Somewhere between the 9 gallons of distilled water and swapping to the proper coolant (previous owner was using the wrong color) I appear to have resolved the issue!

Thanks again for the help!"

Subaru CVT issues
I have a 2010 Subaru Outback (CVT) that recently started exhibiting some strange behavior after a CVT fluid change.

When driving under light to moderate load — usually up a gradual hill — the transmission hovers around 1500 RPM, then suddenly jumps up to 2000-2500 RPM, makes a chirping noise, and then drops back down to around 1500 RPM. It feels like a brief slip or hesitation.

The fluid was changed with the correct Subaru CVT fluid. No check engine light or warning lights so far.

Has anyone experienced something similar?

Any tips on further diagnosing or repairing would be greatly appreciated."

Need Advice-2019 Dodge Journey
Hi! 
I have quite a long story but I need some help. Last November right before Thanksgiving I struck a deer with my vehicle. My insurance paid for the body damage and the radiator that needed to be replaced (I have root insurance-full coverage). When I submitted my claim I sent in pictures and made a verbal statement. A representative never went to inspect the vehicle until here recently. Fast forward a bit and two months ago my vehicle started having issues shifting. When i parked at a gas station it immediately wouldn't move, barely went into reverse. So I had it towed to the dealership where I bought it and the service department was paid by my insurance to do a transmission flush. Mind you my vehicle has 78,000 miles. I picked my vehicle up the next Monday when they said it was running perfectly. Exactly 1 week later I was driving home from the grocery store and it wouldn't shift well and made very loud noises. I again had it towed to the service department. They told me it needed a new transmission. A week went by arguing with insurance and shop to be denied coverage for the transmission replacement. I fought my insurance and said they needed to send someone out in person! They finally did (2 weeks later). They did a detailed diagnostic test where they took samples of fluid and sent it to a lab for results. Which I got today. Come to find out, the service department never even did the transmission flush!! They simply topped off the fluid and changed the filter! The report also states there's a transmission leak. So my question to the people here is, when they do finally complete the actual flush will it even help? Or is my transmission completely shot now?? Do I have the ability to hire an attorney for their neglecting to do their job? Oh and another issue is a representative at the shop told me ""my insurance didn't pay for the flush, they did it to be nice"" I told him ""would you like me to forward you the invoice from my insurance showing it was paid?"" From that point on I spoke directly to his boss the supervisor of the service department. I've also been using their ""loaner"" vehicle since my vehicle has been there. I don't feel like I should have to pay for that knowing what I know now. Any advice would be greatly appreciated "

93 Ford Ranger 2.3L Intermittent Power Loss and Stalling, and Trouble Starting
Hi,

I am looking for some help in diagnosing some issues with my Ranger.

I have experienced intermittent stalling and power loss (driving and idling), the rpm's will dip (2-3,000 to \~ 1,000 rpm's) and I lose power while driving or the vehicle with stall if rpm's are low. Occasionally, it will not start (it cranks), but after resting for a while (1-2 hours) it will. This happens intermittently and has progressively gotten worse (and more frequent) since it first happened a month ago.

For example, this morning I drove to my mechanic (distance of 60km), started fine and occasionally lost power and idled rough, met my mechanic for lunch and drove to get parts (started fine, idled rough and power dipped once). Ran tests, one error code for the IAC (which was fixed) and then took it for a test drive and it had no issues. We then replaced the fuel pump and the 2nd test drive the vehicle stalled twice and had intermittent power failure but started without issue. The mechanic performed the 3rd test drive and the vehicle had no issues and then I drove home without any issues. I waited 2.5 hours and took it on another test drive at home, this time the vehicle stalled twice and had intermittent power issues but started fine every time. When I got home I let it idle to see if it would stall again, it did (after 1 minute) and would not start. I tried running a test with the key turned to see if any error codes showed, but I got nothing and I could not get it to run to finish the rest of the testing.

Since having these issues we have:

\- Changed the Fuel Pump Relay and EEC Relay (Old ones felt ""hot"")

\- New Fuel Pump

\- Cleaned IAC

\- Adjusted Idle throttle

Fuel Filter has 18,000 Km (we checked plastic fuel tank for sediment and found nothing). This truck was went through less than a year ago by my mechanics, not sure what has and hasn't been replaced but it was running without issue until a month ago.

Thanks,

Joshua"

CVT is faulty
Hello, so I have a Nissan Bluebird Sylphy 2006. Now my CVT is having issues, so the car happens to be stuck in a gear, as a result, when i give throttle, it doesn’t move, but once it gains speed it revs upto 6000 but doesn’t shift, and gives a top speed of 60kmph.

I got it checked and they said I have to replace the entire gearbox, I asked them shouldn’t just replacing the belt help me, they said no.

I live in NZ, and its gonna cost me around 4.5k - 5k NZD, which is infact more expensive than the car itself. Can y’all help me what I should do? Any quick fixes or something.

High speed problem with RPM
I've had a 2013 E220 CDI for over a year now and had very little issues with it even on 220k km.

I just noticed recently an issue that I never had before. When accelerating above around 180kmh the RPM will drop slightly and feel sluggish before rissing again a little higher, then a smaller drop again and then higher. It will feel like it can't exceed 210kmh which is unusual as it never used to have any problem cruising up to 240ish kmh. 

I don't often drive that fast but on long journeys I can't hit it once or twice. I had issues with the DPF which was replaced a couple of months ago but that seems to be working fine now. I also had a mechanic look at it a few months ago who claimed the injectors may need cleaning and ordered the cleaning kit for that and proceeded to do the work. 

Any idea what could be causing this?"

2010 Dodge Charger 02 Heater Core Bad
So let me explain, in a normal case. An 02 sensor replacement should be easy with no issues.... and it isn't currently.

  
I have a 2010 Charger with the 3.5 L V6 engine. I've done a lot of work on this motor and replaced the driver's side head (replacing seals and timing belt, lot of maintaince work that previous owners neglected). Part of that process I replaced Driver's Side upstream sensor. (KEEP THIS IN MIND, this was a bosch from Autozone). I worked on the car for a couple of months with battery disconnected. When we were all done, it ran really well and no issues. 

Almost year later (now) I had the passenger side run lean / rich and shutter. Through some trouble shooting I found out that the EGR was carboned up and replaced it. Well during the time that the EGR was malfunctioning (which was a week or two, my daily driver), i had a new code that was P0052 which is the O2 sensor heater core in Bank 2 / 1, the passenger upstream. EGR got fixed and code continued, but car ran better. 

So I replaced the 02 with a Bosch from RockAuto.... didn't fix issue, warranty exchanged it... still didn't work. I figured that maybe it was getting mis-handled in shipping and was more fragile. Plan B? Maybe wiring is bad? So I take the sensor from Bank 1, and swap it with Bank 2...... Bank 2 now works, while Bank 1 doesn't (P0032 code now. Bank 1 / 1 upstream). Go to Advance to get a new one (NTP 02 sensor).... didn't work. Warranty Exchange... still didn't work.

  
So 4 sensors later. I have a problem that doesnt stick to either side of the car. It doesnt matter where I put these new sensors in at, they follow. Plus (per Haynes) the Upstream and Downstream sensors are separate codes, with both sensors being the exact same (4 of the same sensor). YET the sensor I had replaced when I did all the work, still functions regardless of where I install it!?!?!? I've cleared codes, ran the car to see if the 02 learns / adapts, I've unhooked the battery for 10-20 mins (then another time, 2 hrs) to reset the PCM. But still the same issue persists. Even before I start the motor, this code shows. So then the car keeps running rich / lean where the newest sensor is located and shutters. 

  
Any ideas or advice would be helpful. I've done what research and ideas I could, but nothing seems to work. Am I just extremely unlucky with all the different 02 sensors I'm getting? Hard to believe 4 bad sensors. "

Pickup and Dropoff
I have a shop, with a lift, at my farm. I am looking to start a small pickup and drop off mechanic business as a mobile mechanic where I fetch customer vehicles and then drop them back off the same day. I understand the insurance side of what would be required and I very conveniently have a large event center about 15 mins from my farm where lots of people come and stay from 7am to 5pm for events and I could pickup cars there. Is there a reason why more people don’t do this? I have no intentions of opening a mechanic shop where customers can come to my farm for pickup and drop off and I plan to do simple work in the parking lots like a traditional mobile mechanic. I don’t see how it is any different than other mobile guys using a storage unit or renting a small space. Also, I’m in a rural area so no issue with my neighbors."

2006 sienna with a traction control system problem… maybe
Hey there-

I have an issue that doesn’t generate any codes. First started several years ago, very intermittently. First time I had the problem I was in the Rockies heading up the hill on the freeway and the car made some loud and rapid beep-beep-beep alarm and the left front slammed on the breaks. Scary as shit.

Kept it in town mostly after that, but I could make it do it on one specific road with a slight incline, and a slight turn to the right. See the crappy video I made of this back then:

https://youtube.com/shorts/t6HKrJ6ZhgM?si=sPj7x1tvZII0r2wr

My local mechanic couldn’t replicate it, and it eventually needed tires, and magically the problem went away.

Until now. I was driving it today and on a slight uphill and a slight turn to the right, it felt like the brakes were holding me up. No rapid beeping.

Any thoughts?"

High Performance Car Tire Wear / Alignment Issue - Need Expert Advice
I drive a high-performance car that I occasionally take to the track (very rarely). I am not a mechanic, just someone who values safety at high speeds.

**Issue:** My 19"" Michelin Pilot Sport 4S tires wore out after only 5K miles (normally last 10-12K). One tire even showed exposed cables.

**Tire Pressure History:**

* Tire Shop Set: 38F/33R PSI (cold)  (155 mph max speed)
* I recently changed to: 45F/39R PSI (cold)  (180 mph max speed) after checking my gas cap recommendations for ""top speed/normal load"" (please see the attached gas cap table)

**Questions:**

1. My alignment report shows Right Rear in RED zone - is this acceptable? (please see the alignment report). If not, should I take it back to the shop so that they can fix it or is there a possibility that there's something wrong with the suspension and I need to fix an issue for the alignment to be correctable ?
2. Could my previous alignment measurements have caused premature wear?
3. Does higher tire pressure significantly accelerate wear during spirited/high-speed driving? Could this have worn out the tires so much quicker than usual ?
4. What would you recommend for a very spirited driving as far as for my car specifically. I love turns and speed but I don't often exceed 155mph, very rarely so I thought that the higher inflation is safer just in case because max speed on it is up to 180mph.

Advice Needed Regarding Clutch Issues – Opel Astra
Dear Reddit superheroes

My wife drives an Opel Astra, and over the past few weeks, the clutch pedal had become increasingly stiff. Last Monday, the pedal stopped returning to its original position. To be able to drive the car, we had to start it in neutral and manually pull the clutch pedal back up. After doing so, we could drive by forcefully shifting gears without using the clutch.

Due to this issue, we took the car to the nearest garage. It is a Peugeot dealership that recently became an Opel dealer as well. However, we are not regular customers there.

They have now informed us that the hydraulic release bearing is broken and have also recommended replacing the flywheel and clutch.

We are not very knowledgeable about cars, but after researching flywheel issues, we have not noticed many of the typical symptoms associated with a failing flywheel.

Since we are not familiar with this garage and have limited knowledge about car mechanics, we want to ensure that we are not being advised to replace unnecessary parts.

Any advice would be greatly appreciated, even if our description might be somewhat vague.

Thank you!"

2005 Chevy Malibu gear shift issue
Here's the issue. I backed my 2005 Chevy Malibu into a parking space put it in park came back out from inside the store and turn the key nothing happened. Thought it was the battery then realized that even though the gear shift was all the way forward and Park it was only in reverse according to the dash display. Turn the key on shift it down to neutral and drive and low it just felt like it was moving too loose and not actually shifting into gears. I was finally able to push the gear shift forward into park and then take my hand and basically it forward to get the gear shift to actually pop into park. Got it started had to shift all the way down into low to get it into drive just to get it home. Parked it same thing again had to put it in park and Force the gear shift forward to get it to move from reverse into park. 

It was too dark to tell much. I can see that the shifter cable is attached. I had the same year make and model a few years back and that one had an issue with the shifter cable popping off until I got that fixed. But I don't know if this is a linkage issue or not. What's the likelihood of somebody with maybe beginner to intermediate skills being able to fix this."

Wheel bearing hum no play. Asking for next course of action.
Alright so I have a hum coming from the drivers front wheel. Likely to be a wheel bearing issue. There is no play in the wheel when it's jacked up. Nor any other wheels. (Which does not mean the wheel bearing is fine) I have a warranty on my car with 4 days left. (2013 Infinity G37x just hit 60k miles)

I took my car to an ""in network"" mechanic to have this checked out. The closest in network mechanic is 100 miles away at a Midas shop. The in network deductible for a fix is $100. Out of network is $350.

Anyways I took my car to Midas and the mechanic swore up and down it's just road noise and it's fine. I even rode in the car with him as he test drove it and he did not hear anything but it was a GLARINGLY obvious hum.... I hear this hum anywhere from 5mph and up. Martha Focker a car does not generate a hum noise in a specific location at 5pm due to road noise. It is a mechanical problem.

So my question is. Do I take a day off work which will be a loss of roughly $300 income, and take it to an out of network more reputable shop nearby for a cost of $350 deductible. Or do I let my warranty expire and eventually pay full cost of a wheel bearing replacement on a day off which I do not know the cost of. Parts are roughly $80....unsure of labor cost."

Swapping Batteries 04 Saturn Vue 4 Cyl to ‘12 Subaru Outback?
So my I ended up getting my grandmas 2012 Outback with only 60k miles on it. Always garage kept. Heated and cooled garage. I’m in NY. The underneath looks like a new car. Which is shocking for a car even 13 years old. She used to not drive in rain or snow. The paint looks new. Since basically it’s barely been in the sun. Sucks I don’t have a garage to keep it from the elements as well. 

But only a few months ago I got a new battery for my Saturn. Btw the best vehicle I’ve ever owned. Had it like 11 years and never had a single issue. Paid $1800 for it. Best deal ever. Hope this Saturn is as good to me. And it’s worth almost 5 times what I paid for the Saturn.

So can these batteries be swapped? The only number that looks the same is the cold cranking amps. The Outbacks battery is a Subaru battery so guessing it’s 13 years old. Shocking was when I replaced my Vue’s battery it was the original battery from the factory. The guy at auto parts did like a quadruple take reading the date on it. He couldn’t believe it was a 20 year old battery that just quit. "

3rd repair of engine mounts?
I’m sorry to bother the Technicians seeing I am a non-technician or mechanic, but so many non-mechanics give misleading info.  I figured you all would be the best to ask:

I have a 2018 Ford Fusion:  2.5L 4 Cyl.  130,000 miles.  I’ve Owned since 2021:  Never had any mechanical issues with the vehicle with the exception of broken engine mounts in August of 2023.  

Engine mounts broke again January of 2024:  Had them fixed again.  

Broke again June 2024:  The car has now been sitting since June of 2024:  I drive carefully and cautiously:  I only drive to the store, pharmacy and church on Sundays.  

First repair was done by a shop my extended warranty sent me to.  

Second shop (2nd repair) said first repair shop did a horrible job and said their fix was only temporary because they noticed a bolt was broken off in the frame that 1st repair never fixed…therefore they said their repair would only be temporary:

I preceded to have it fixed anyway and sure enough.  The fix was only temporary.  

Should I take to a Ford Dealership and have it fixed, or should I not even bother with getting engine mounts fixed a 3rd time.  Sorry for the length but I wanted to provide as much detail as possible.

Toyota Camry 2014 SE rusted front struts
Hey guys, so I have a small issues I'm looking at. I've did a visual inspection on my tires and came across a rusted front strut. What do you guys think? Is it bad enough or just clean it and spray fluid film on it. I've sprayed a layer last spring and now I guess the elements due to the winter here in MD stripped it off. Should it replace them or just treat it? Thanks guys, any input on it would be great.

What would be a good long term car 10-15k

I used to be a decent shade tree mechanic, but I really want something that will be reliable and last long term enough I can will it to my grandson. It would have to be an automatic unfortunately, because I may end up having difficulty with a clutch.

Steering issue
Not sure where to ask but i’ve been having this weird issue on the left front wheel when i turn hard left backing out or doing a uturn/donut it feels like the car is crab walking kind of bouncing almost as if the wheel is loose or turning to far out & the farther into it you go it becomes very noticeable but normal driving & turning ranges it’s unnoticeable. I grabbed the control arm with the 
wheel turned so I could access it on the ground no movement, grabbed the cv axle no movement

grabbed the sway bar from up top & it noticeably shakes & is pretty loose i checked the other side it doesn’t move. I’ve never worked on suspension components am i in the right ball park of thinking? when I google this it suggests a cv axle joint but no clunking is heard when driving and the boot wasn’t ripped. for some reason also this wheel has no weights on it."

Car in park & parking brake rolling
Had a really weird circumstance happen yesterday so I was hoping to ask the pros for some guidance.

Have a 2024 Mazda CX-90. We have a short driveway that is on about a 35-38 degree slope down to the street. Came home yesterday (it was snowing, very wet snow) and backed in per usual, put the car in park, engaged the parking brake, and turned off. Did the usual sit in the car for 5 minutes before heading back into the chaos, but all of a sudden the car just started rolling forward. Pressed on the brake which worked fine and did the entire process again. No issues, parking brake, etc. As soon as I got out of the car, starts rolling.

Parked it on the street to be safe, no issues. I’m currently in the car, backed into the drive way per usual, and there have been no issues for the past 15 minutes. It couldn’t have just been the snow, right? The brakes worked when I pressed them, no sliding. 

I’m at a loss for what it could have been. I don’t see any issues reported from other Mazda owners. Any advice/ideas would help!"

Mercedes GL550 (MY09) X164 - Any insights on a mixture issue?
Backstory: Recently driving our GL I started to notice some oddities in the performance and sound. Shortly thereafter and, fortunately, close to home, the battery light came on and I lost power steering suddenly. Sure enough, after limping home, I found the upper right engine pulley and serpentine belt had failed. There were pieces of belt and bits of black plastic from the pulley around the engine bay, but not a huge amount.  
  
I replaced the pulley and belt, along with both air filters. However, upon the first start of the car, post belt/pulley replacement, the CEL was now on. The performance (normal driving) seems fine. However, the idle is occasionally rough. The CEL codes are P0172 and P0175, ""running too rich"" on both banks. Whereas this issue was seemingly a result of the belt/pulley problem, I'm confused about what could be causing this mixture issue. Are these related? I've cleaned the MAF, changed the air filters, and visually inspected the intakes (plastic), which seem undamaged from the belt/pully failure. I can't find any evidence of damage from the incident, but it's too coincidental that it could be unrelated. I tinkered with my diagnostic tool, which allows me to adjust the lean/rich mixture levels, but it didn't seem to change the idle roughness or resolve the CEL.  
  
Does anyone have any thoughts on what to try next? I've read elsewhere that I could try replacing the purge valve, but haven't done that yet. Any insight, tips, or troubleshooting is so greatly appreciated. I'm currently frustrated and at a loss of where to look next for a culprit."

My Pontiac G6 is experiencing an issue. The drivers side door latch will fall back down into the ""closed"" position once the door is opened. 

I've been needing to take a screwdriver and manually reset the latch to the ""open"" position before closing the door. It seems like the latch is loose, or a spring may not be working inside, I'm not familiar with the internals of the mechanism.

Steering noise. But it never happens at the shop.
Hey y’all,

So, I have a 2015 Chevrolet Malibu, which has been an amazing car for me. This month will make 7 years without any major issues.

That being said, I’ve noticed a strange noise (video for reference) when steering, but it used to only happen only in heavy rain, and when parked. 

I live in the Chicago area, so we get some pretty cold winters. This year has been mild, but I’ve noticed the noise has begun to get even louder and happens every day regardless of temperature or rain. 

I’ve taken it in to a couple shops over the past two years, and when I get there, the sound goes away. They can’t diagnose it, and they didn’t find anything when looking. Of course, right?

I guess I’m just looking for someone to point me in the right direction as to what this mystery could be."

Possible fuel contamination??
I own a 1995 dodge caravan automatic. One day I filled up on gas and ever since the vehicle has had an issue with stalling randomly mostly while slowing down but sometimes when speeding up. There is no warning before the stall, it just happens. The stalling stops for the most part when the gas tank reaches half full, but starts stalling again when filled up. It also sometimes struggles to start when the tank is full. I initially thought it was water in the gas so used a fuel additive, but have since filled up once since then at a different gas station. Could the fuel I put in my tank be contaminated? What other things could it be?"

Any help with this noise? Cv axle? Or worse?
Help, I'm trying to figure this out. This is my son's car that my wife has been using while he's off at college. Anyway she called one day and said it won't drive home from her work. Upon looking and driving slightly i heard the same rumbling that sounds like bearings bouncing around and then the wheels seemingly locked up. Tow home and started playing with it


I have already replaced the cv axle and wheel bearing on the passenger side which is where the noise seemed to be coming from. I did check the trans fluid which was low but did not smell burnt.

Anyway could it be driver side axle as well? Or sounding like transmission? The noise goes for a moment then the wheel seems to lock up. The car does drive fine in reverse, yet fwd and turning left seemed to be an issue.

Transmission issue ? 2000 TJ Jeep

I have a manual 2000 TJ Wrangler with a 2.5L 4-cylinder engine. On January 4, I replaced the alternator with an Ultima 117 Amp (R111073B). The next day, I installed a new battery (EverStart Size 34, 12 Volt, 700 CCA). Afterward, the Jeep ran fine, but there was a squeaking sound.

While replacing the alternator, I noticed the serpentine belt was slightly frayed along the edges, so I decided to replace it with a Duralast Belt 923K6. The squeak is now gone, but I’ve noticed a new issue. When I downshift from 5th gear at around 60 mph and take my foot off the gas, the Jeep jerks a bit to the left.

To troubleshoot, I loosened the tensioner so there’s about ¼ to ½ inch of depression on the longest stretch of the serpentine belt. This seemed to help a little, but the jerking is still there.

It didn’t feel like this right after replacing the alternator or battery. Is it transmission issue, and if so, why would it start after replacing the serpentine belt? "

2018 Silverado sensor issue
Hey y’all, I’m looking to pick some brains on a problem I’m having with my 2018 Silverado. A while ago my dash was popping the “stabilitrack” “abs” and “traction control” messages. The lights on the dash and the notifications would pop up sporadically on and off. With that, my dash was also showing that my front driver side wheel would lose traction even though it was in a 2 wheel (rear wheel) setting. So I changed the wheel sensor, and after starting the vehicle the lights and warnings are no longer sporadic they are permanently on. I’ve tried 3 different wheel sensors, and replaced the harness side adaptor as well. I’ve checked the hub bearing, by raising it off the ground and pulling and pushing and I have no movement of any kind so I don’t think that’s the issue. I’ve checked fuses, and back tracked the wiring and see no rips or splits. Does anyone have any other ideas?

Can anyone diagnose this horrible sound?
Yesterday, as I was driving on a long uphill stretch of hwy, my truck (2003 ford ranger) started making a loud rattling/clanking noise out of the engine bay, and threw a cylinder1 misfire code.  Sound gets faster when accelerating.

Upon arriving at home, when I checked the oil level it was very low.

I added oil, started it up, got a rattling noise upon start up, then it went away.  Short test drive with no issue.  The check engine light also has not turned back on.

---

Today, upon start up same noise, then smooth sailing.  On my way back home after work, the rattling/clanking noise came back twice as bad, and now I am afraid to drive it to the mechanic.

Can anyone help me diagnose the issue/ tell me if it is ok to drive to the mechanic (my mechanic is about 25 min away)

2016 Ford Focus SE Hatchback Coolant issue
For a while I was running into a problem where I would top off my coolant and in no time the car began running hot. Fast forward to last week and my car started to overheat while driving, quickly resulting in the inability to accelerate (I'm assuming as a fail-safe so that I can't damage the engine). I let the car cool down, added coolant, and went to work. I was able to drive home after work. By the next morning, the amount of coolant I added was on the ground under my car (appearing to have come from the top left corner where the reservoir is). The past few days has been a cycle of waking up, adding coolant, going to work (the car does not leak while driving and there is a minimal amount leaking while I am parked at work for a  12-14 hour shift), I go home, and the coolant is on the ground the next morning. 

  
Ultimately I will go to a mechanic for a diagnosis, but I do have to wait for payday. I have read it could be a crack in the reservoir, a faulty hose, or a damaged water pump. I was recommended K-Seal by a coworker and while I read a multitude of success stories I am a little worried to try it because of the clogging risks I've also read. Any ideas on what the issue could be or a temporary solution to make it to payday (besides buying a gallon of coolant a day)?"

Aftermarket Power Outlet Issue on 1989 Ford Ranger XLT 2.9L V6
I have a 1989 Ford Ranger XLT 2.9L V6 with an aftermarket power outlet that includes two USB ports and a power socket. It’s tapped into a 10 amp fuse but recently stopped working I went and bought another one and it’s not working either. I checked the fuse slot with a multimeter, and it has power. I also tested the power outlet directly on the car battery, and it works fine. However, when I tried sticking the positive and negative wires of the outlet directly into the fuse slot, it only powered the truck speakers (which share the fuse) but not the outlet itself. I’m not sure what’s going on—could it be an issue with the wiring, grounding, or the fuse amperage? Any advice or suggestions would be greatly appreciated!

I feel awful. Am I at fault. 
Just a little bit of background. I am an Ase certified technician with 20+ years of experience. I have never had an engineer fail after a repair. Here is what happened. I replace a coolant expansion tank on a 2018 Mercedes gls450. After the repair I test drove the vehicle to make sure the heat worked properly and the temperature did not go above normal operating temperature. The customer came back the next day with the vehicle overheating. She drove the vehicle in and did not use a tow service. During my inspection I noticed one of the hoses had blown off with the clamp still installed on the hose. I filled the coolant and installed a new clamp. After a good warm up cycle while monitoring the coolant temp with a scan tool I took the vehicle for a long test drive. No issues. I cleared any codes and double checked the coolant level. All good. The customer returned within 20 minutes with white smoke bellowing from the exhaust and a flashing CEL. Cylinder 5 and 6 are misfiring. The coolant temp is in range and the reservoir is full. Pulled plugs 5 and 6 and found coolant. The head and gasket are obviously compromised. I feel like I did my due diligence but I know the responsibility is mine. I just wish the customer had pulled over and called for a tow truck for the initial overheating concern. What could I have done differently?"

Dodge Dart Battery Dying 
We recently got a 2014 Dodge Dart for our 16 year old. We bought it from my mom's boss.  He warned us initially that the battery would die frequently,  but it should not be an issue if it's started every couple days.  Ultimately, he put in a new battery before we bought it. They also brought it in and checked out several things and said the alternator was fine.  

The car sat for a month before my daughter got her license. The battery was dead when we went to start it, but that made sense since it hadn't been started. We jumped it and had no issues for a couple of weeks. Fast forward to Friday. My husband drove it to work, to pick our son up from school and back home, and then ultimately to our storage unit. So it was driven close to 2 hours on Friday. When he went to leave the storage unit, it was dead. It did take a charge and he made it home.  He turned it off and tried it again and it was dead. It was already scheduled to be looked at tomorrow, so we tried jumping it tonight.  It eventually started, but died (while started) after he removed the cables. There is an aftermarket radio installed.  Could this be our pain point? Why else would a brand new battery not hold a charge if the alternator is truly ""fine""?"

1995 Vw Cabrio Speedo help
Someone please help I cannot get my speedo and tac to work at all on my 1995 Volkswagen cabrio (2.0L) | have spent upwards of 16+ hours trying to fix this stupid issue to pass inspection and so I can read my speed without gps... So to start, I have tried 3 different speed sensors all of which do nothing. They all give a power reading so the sensors themselves aren't bad.. Now onto the sensor plug, it gives a reading of 00.1-00.2 ohms on one contact out of 3, the other opposite contact gives 00.0 ohms and the middle I believe is simply a ground. If you try to read 12v out of the plug it reads nothing at all no numbers. Now for my cluster itself, everything but my speed and rpm reads..so I have temp and gas which works fine, odometer turns on but does not count up, clock works as well, can switch to trip but like odometer doesn't count up. I have not tested power from the cluster itself as I'm trying to avoid ripping my dash apart if possible. I know nothing about electrical but what all this is telling me is the wires to my sensor plug are bad and need replaced or at worst it's the cluster going bad....

2016 Vauxhall Movano - Engine Starts but Stalls, No Revs - Video
Hi everyone,  
I've been having some trouble with my 2016 Vauxhall Movano (2.3 CDTI, 125ps, 35 L3 FWD H1 Chassis Cab, Curtainsider). Here's what's happening:

* Symptoms:
   * The van would initially run but not give high revs when accelerating.
   * It starts but then shuts off after a few seconds.
   * Yesterday it was 4 degrees outside and it manage to idle but still not a lot of revs

I've tried a few things but wanted to share a video to see if anyone has insights or can spot something I might have missed.

What I've Noticed:

* The problem seemed to worsen in freezing conditions.
* Voltage reading is 12.95V, so I don't think it's the battery.
* I've considered issues like:
   * Throttle body might need cleaning (it's not giving revs, and I've heard of this being a common issue).
   * EGR valve possibly stuck or dirty.
   * Idle Air Control Valve or fuel system issues.

Questions:

* Has anyone dealt with a similar problem on this model?
* What would you recommend checking first based on the video?
* Any tips on cleaning the throttle body or checking the EGR valve for this specific model?

I appreciate any advice or if there are any known issues with this year's Movano. I've got a mechanic appointment in 1.5 weeks, but I'm curious if there's something I can try in the meantime.  
Thanks for your time!

Desperate for help.  Electric door lock stuck.  2010 Toyota Minivan.
I will be as descriptive as I can.  I’m like a monkey looking at a math problem when it comes to cars.

We bought the van used, knowing it had been totaled and has issues.  All we can afford.  This problem did not exist when we bought it, but could still be related obviously.

The passenger side door lock started not allowing the door to open from the inside.  It could be opened from the outside for about a day, and now the lock will not release no matter what we try.

When the van starts the doors lock automatically, the lock in question will click 3 or 5 times in quick succession, pause, then do it again.  This does not change anything however.

I am hoping this is something I might be able to do myself so any help would be amazing!

My curious ass fucked up. 2018 Lexus NX300 Software Update
So I intended to get my sister in law an adapter for apple carplay in her newly purchased 2018 NX300. In researching that, I found that the integrated infotainment system could be updated to have Carplay natively with a software update. 

I first tried the software update 17LDL1NA-EB02 from lexus.com to see if that would contain the Carplay update but it did not. However, I had no issues with the system functioning on this software. 

I then tried the process [HERE](https://www.toyotanation.com/threads/apple-carplay-update-files-18-camry-sienna-18-19-lexus-models.1652876/?nested_view=1&sortby=oldest). I formatted my 8gb flash drive to FAT32, extracted the 2018 NX300 compressed download to the freshly formatted flash drive, put that in the vehicle, turned it on, went to ""software update"" in the vehicle settings menu, and got this issue during the install. For reference, the contents of the flash drive looked [like this](https://imgur.com/a/OsV4qHu)

[""No new software or the media is not inserted""](https://imgur.com/a/QxI1eNw) appeared after downloading 1-4 of 4.

After turning off the car and disconnecting the battery for an hour, I got [""Unable to update the software. Please try again later.""](https://imgur.com/a/QxI1eNw)

I attempted to set it back to the software provided by Lexus that had worked before the update (you know, the insurance I thought I had to try something with a car I don't own) and it says ""software is incompatible"".

The car starts, runs and drives fine. HVAC works as expected. But the infotainment screen just sticks at ""there is no new software or the media is not inserted"" and won't go to the home screen. So no radio, no nothing on the screen. 

I will personally send $20 to anyone who can get me out of this mess. Thank you in advance."

2016 Ford Expedition Wrench 🔧 Symbol 
Long story short, I had the AC,worked on at a major tire companies retail tire store.  Withen 20 minutes of leaving the store I get the wrench 🔧 Symbol on my dash a complete loss of power (safe mode).  I pull over, turn off the car and back on, and then the car seemef fine.  Later that day the same thing happened.  Now it is happening frequently.  The mechanic said it needed an oil change which we did.  They checked the codes and did not see anything.  After leaving for the second time within a few miles it happened again. I went back, they checked the codes and said that they see a throttle body code and I need to yake it to the dealer.  I called a few dealerships in the area and they are all booked up until after Christmas.  

I have a few questions.  Is it possible that the first shop caused this issue when working on the AC?  With the fact that te dealership are booked for the next week, should I try a non dealer?  Any thoughts about the cause/solution?  

By the way, I am located in Cape Coral Florida on vacation and will need to drive 1,000 miles North in 2 weeks.

Thank you for any recommendations..."

Help with car AC!
Ok I need help! I have an ‘08 Scion. I am wondering where the heck to start with diagnosing an issue with my car’s AC. A few months ago, I changed the motor fan as this same issue happened recently. The motor fan is only a few months old so I’m figuring now it’s something else —

A week or so ago my AC started to turn off and on while in use. It was randomly cut out like it short-circuited or something. Now, I just went to turn on my AC & it doesn’t turn on at all. No hot air or cold air! When I turn the temp, that doesn’t change anything and neither does changing the speed level from Low to High. 

I’m just a 28 year old girl who doesn’t know a thing about cars. Please SOS! Don’t wanna take it to a mechanic bc it’ll be an arm and a leg!

A note that may or may not be important is that I live in a warm to hot climate year-round (75-85 degrees ish). Not sure if that affects auto systems at all.

2107 GMC Terrain SLE V6 AWD
For the last two weeks or so my car has been acting strange. Not all the time but occasionally when I try to start it, it wil click maybe 5 or 6 time and start. When that happens the light with the car and lock comes on until I shut it down and start it again. This behavior does not happen all the time. Today I drove 45 miles, stopped for maybe 5 minutes and when I tried to start it it acted up again. It always starts after a few clicks. When I got home I turned it of and it started right  up without any issues and the car with lock light was off. I am going to get my battery tested this weekend but since it actually start after a few clicks, and since it only does that maybe once or twice a week I am not sure if that is the problem. Did anybody else experience this and what was the fix.

Green purple camera 
We bought our Hyundai Santa Fe Sport new back in 2016. When we got it the backup camera would sometimes show this screen. Sales guy said they weren’t sure why but we could bring it back (my husband really wanted to take it home that day) and they’d figure it out/replace it if necessary if we brought it back another day. It didn’t display every time just intermittently. I took it back and they guy said since it wasn’t displaying when they saw it, and they tried multiple times and ran various diagnostics, he said he didn’t know what else to do (although I really think they might have  done a system update or reinstall or something but it was 8 years ago and I had a 6 month old I was distracted by). It also never did it again…. Until last year when it had to get some work done due to a fender bender. When I picked it up from the shop the backup screen showed like this again. A few weeks later I took it to the dealership to have some recalls taken care of (nothing camera related) and when I left the camera was fine again. We have since gotten a new car and the Santa Fe just sat in our driveway for almost a year waiting to be sold. The battery died and once we replaced it, this screen was back. I’m fairly positive the repair shop said they had removed the battery so my thinking is that that reset something in the system maybe…..? We are finally getting around to selling it and I called the Hyundai dealership and they said they don’t have records from when they looked at it back in 2017 and the records from last year don’t say they did anything with the camera that would explain it being fixed and they don’t see any system updates or anything. They are also saying for them to do anything now they want a $185 diagnostic fee… I really don’t want to be sinking money in this car especially when that’s just a diagnostic fee and there’s no telling what the issue is. 
Does anyone here have any ideas or insight?"

I was also charged additional fees since the field inspector didn’t show up when he was supposed to and told about additional daily storage fees that would apply 30 minutes before it would take effect. I called the police for a civil standby which ended up useless since it’s a civil matter and pissed them off even further, resulting in even higher payments. At this point I’m too tired and don’t have the energy to fight this anymore. I only care if my car is safe to drive. Can anyone please advise if the airbag message indicates that it’s a faulty sensor or something mechanical? And if all the warning indicators are related to the same problem (as a car enthusiast friend had advised me)? I know I need to take it to the dealership now, which is what I was trying to avoid in the first place since the preowned car dealership only gave me 1 set of keys that ended up breaking and I paid around $700 just for one new key fob at the dealership. I feel completely stupid and regretful for dragging my mom into this mess—lesson learned for next time. I don’t know much about cars and would appreciate any insight into this report.

How to avoid a diagnostics fee when I am 99.9999% sure I know what's wrong with the car
Have a 2019 Toyota RAV4 and the past couple of months have had a ""Engine Maintenance Required Visit Dealer"" notification. This is different than an oil change notification because I know how to clear those out after an oil change. I've never had issues with the car, works fine, notification goes away when the AC is off then immediately comes back when I turn AC on.

After doing research and this seems to be a problem with that year range of RAV4's, turns out it's the coolant bypass value and it's not apart of a recall or anything. 

Want to get this fixed but don't want to go to the mechanic and have them run a diagnostics test and charge me an additional $100-$200 when I know what the problem is. What is the best way to go about this? "

What’s correct and fair practice in this? 
Mechanics and Toyota Yaris owners,
So I have a 2007 yaris hatchback.
The AC was not blowing cold air a couple of months ago, and I finally took it into a repair shop. After diagnosis, they tell me I need a new condenser and compressor. Thorough system clean out. Recharge, etc.. They have it all done in a day and I was driving home in 90° temperatures and what was a 45 minute drive, only to discover that at the end of the day, even after that long on the road, the interior temperature blowing out of the vents was only reaching the mid to high 60s inside the vent. Life was busy, and it was about a month before I could leave it with them again, so I just had to suffer. I take it back, already having explained the problem. They have it another day or two and this time when I pick it up, they tell me they were only charging me for the part. This time they say it was an expansion valve.

This is a Friday afternoon right before close. But it’s still pretty warm and on the way home I realize that it’s actually blowing hot now.  If I leave the vent fan on and the AC off, I was retrieving cool evening air. But with the air conditioning on, The temperature was actually going up reaching the high 80s when the outside temperature was 72.
So once again, back to it. This time when I arrive, the head mechanic comes out while a vehicle is still running to see the air-conditioning thermometer in the vent, measuring once again, a higher temperature than the outdoor temperature.  Mind you last time it was “repaired” it wasn’t cooling enough. Not to keep up with any kind of warm temperature. But it was still cooler than the outside temperature. After this expansion valve install suddenly everything is hot.

Now after they have had it a week and a half I called them to find out what is up since I haven’t heard anything. Now I’m told I need an evaporator coil.  And that repair is going to cost me $1100. The part being under $300.00. Mostly labor cost.
On the 2007 Yaris hatchback, how hard to access is this thing and how many hours is it likely actually going to take?

And is it even reasonable for them to ask me to pony up so much money on what should already have been considered a warranty repair? I didn’t go in there telling them what I wanted them to replace. I stated the problem that the AC did not work. It was only blowing at outside temperature.

Even if all of the things they say need to be done, shouldn’t all the work they had done already have assess this problem and missed it in this case, why am I having to eat the cost of the labor instead of the shop? If I had never picked it up to begin with. They did the repairs they thought were necessary, over their own work, found the problem continued. Would it not be protocol in most cases to call me and let me know that there is additional work needed? 
I am pretty certain that it probably would have been a lot less labor since some of the parts they have interacted with in the process have had to be worked through multiple times. 
Now all this back-and-forth and each time there’s a new solution. In all of these cases, I don’t see how they could’ve actually demoed their own work to check for quality control. They say it’s fixed and it seems like I must be the first one to drive it to that it’s not blowing anything like it should. And it’s especially ridiculous that the first return visit actually visit it was worse than before.
So what should I do in this scenario?  Is everything I am being told fair and balanced?
Or do these people not know what they’re doing to begin with and having me eat the cost of their not being thorough?
Trying to gain a consensus as I’ve talked to some other local mechanics without stating what business I’m dealing with currently. They are frustrated that it ever left without the fact that the AC was still not working properly being diagnosed. Even if there was additional work to be done, they think that should’ve been discovered by their diagnostic process after the repairs they had completed to firm everything was proper.

The last local mechanic, I spoke to was a bit concerned that they replaced the condenser and the compressor and did a system flush, but apparently, after the fact needed to put in an expansion valve. This recent mechanic, I spoke to also said he’s a bit concerned that they never dealt with the evaporator to begin with as it is often part of the process for making sure that everything is clear and blockage free.

There’s some suggestions being made of implied warranties, possibly also trumping whatever existing written warranty they may have since supposedly there is an expectation that if you bring something for repair and you are told it is repaired, it should be repaired and functioning to a reasonable degree."

2017 Hyundai Tucson AC issues
Since I bought the car brand new in 2017, I've had nothing but AC problems. In June 2018 (just a year after I bought it), the vehicle started blowing warm when AC was on. Took it to the dealer, and they replace a temp sensor and inhibitor switch. Still had the issue and a week later, they replaced the compressor assembly. So it's been almost 6 years to the day (and 50,000 miles later), and now I have the issue again of it blowing hot when AC is on, but now only on drivers side. They are telling me it needs a new control head, which is almost $600 for the part, plus almost $300 labor. With diagnostic fees, total repair bill comes out to $973.37.

I'm pissed that it's not covered under warranty. It's obviously been a documented issue from the start with the AC system. Does the cost to repair seem reasonable? I know nothing about cars, and not sure if the dealer is charging too much for the part/labor. Thanks in advance!"

2000 Mercedes C230 and I Can't Open the Trunk
Hello. It seems the battery is dead. I tried to start the car and the steering wheel and ignition were both locked. Jiggling/wiggling didn't unlock them. I tried new batteries in the fob. Nothing. So I guess it's the car battery. Problem is I can't get the trunk (where the battery is) to open, even with the metal key. I have a charger, but the charging port in the engine compartment looks like it is all positive. Am I correct? I tried connecting the ground clamp to a metal piece, but couldn't find anything that wasn't aluminum or painted metal.

Is there something I'm missing? Any ideas I haven't tried yet? Or am I going to have to have the car towed to my mechanic?"

Recall at dealership
Hello, I had a quick question about what the best option would be involving a recall. The shifter bushing on my dodge dart evaporated. After a month I was able to get the car into a dealership. I used the engine-side shifter to get it up there and after getting in the bay I had trouble getting it back in park. The tech told me to leave it there and that it was fine. Got a call back today that they weren’t able to replace the bushing cause the battery died and they couldn’t recharge it. They want to charge me for a new one. My issue is I had no problem starting it up the month I waited and I feel like they just screwed me. I’m leaning towards refusing the battery replacement, towing it back to my house and doing it myself like I should have. I don’t want to pay them for something they caused. Any opinion is appreciated, let me know if you need me to clarify anything. Thanks."

Is Dealerships supplying non-dealership batteries normal practice?
My wife drove her jeep to work on June 8th and when she tried to leave that evening her car wouldn't start. Her starter was replaced earlier in the year, but when we had her Jeep toe to dealership they said they couldn't perform diagnostics because suddenly the batteries were testing bad too. They charged us $800 for to replace my batteries and didn't actually end up fixing the root cause of the problem. We had another independent mechanic look at the car yesterday and today and fixed what the dealership did not fix in 2 months of back and forth. While he was fixing what he believed to be the problem (thought it was the alternator, turned out just to be a loose connection the whole time) he discovered that the batteries in her Jeep now were sure start( O'Reilly's brand) batteries. I absolutely want to light a fire under their ass because they dicked us around for too long, so I'm wondering is it normal for dealerships to not supply dealership batteries? I'm not a car person but I am pissed off so any help would be much appreciated."

Dispute with mechanic over cooling problem — Am I being unreasonable?
I'm in the middle of a dispute with a mechanic I've used a couple of times, and before I escalate it, I'd like your read about whether I'm being unreasonable. Slightly long post—sorry, but I want to give you as much info as I can. TL;DR, my mechanic charged me $1,800 to replace my thermostat and water pump, then charged me a second inspection fee and quoted me $1,200 to replace my cooling fan when my car still had the same problem after I brought it home. I think they screwed up the first time and refuse to admit it and, maybe more importantly, have discovered that they may have \*wildly\* overcharged me for the work they did do.

Early last month, I realized my 2018 Nissan Sport Rogue SV was overheating while i was in a drive-thru line -- not redlining, but close. I turned the heat on full blast and managed to get the engine heat down to normal, then took it to a shop I'd used a couple of times. They charged me a $100 inspection fee and then said that my thermostat wasn't opening and my water pump needed to be replaced. They quoted me me $1,813.16 for those jobs. The breakdown according to the repair order was $787.78 for the water pump—$680 for labor, $107.78 for parts—and $693.45 for the thermostat—that’s $98.45 for parts, $595 for labor—plus another $120 for labor to replace the coolant and test-drive the car, $100 for the initial diagnostic, $93.88 in fees, and $18.05 in taxes. (For reference, I'm in the metro area of a fairly major US city—smaller than Chicago, but larger than Portland.) That seemed like a lot, but I paid it—cars are expensive I guess. They do the work and I get my car back.

The second time I drive it—and, importantly, the first time I let it idle—it overheats in the exact same way, except this time I don't notice in time and it's coolant smoking from under the hood, check engine light on, etc. I had had my car back for less than a week at this point. I have it towed back to the shop and tell them what happened. They look at it and send me a new quote: $1,200 to replace the cooling fan, plus \*another\* $100 inspection fee.

I'm a little surprised by this. I ask the manager if her position is that the previous work they did was necessary, and she says yes. I tell her I have a hard time believing that—that would mean that my thermostat, water pump, AND fan all went kaput at same time. She sticks to her guns. I also tell her that I feel I shouldn't have to pay them a second inspection fee when I paid them one a week ago and they failed to find the problem with my car.

She says, essentially ""it's not our fault we didn't catch it, because the fan was working fine when we looked at it."" I responded that I had a very, very hard time believing that -- they're telling me that my broken thermostat and water pump were making my car overheat, and then coincidentally, immediately after I got the vehicle back, the fan went out and and made my car overheat in exactly the same way. I tell her that I think it's much more likely their techs didn't test my car properly—if I had to guess, they drove it around the block and never let it idle—and that I'm having my car towed to another shop.

When I drop my car off at the other shop (a location of a regional chain of auto shops—I basically just picked the closest shop to them with decent reviews), I ask them to do me a favor and give me a written quote for replacing the thermostat and water pump. Their quote: Just under $800. It broke down to a $60 inspection fee, $180.02 for the thermostat, $552.94 for the water pump, parts, labor, and tax included.

My jaw dropped when I saw that — I understand prices vary, but this was less than half of what I paid. I went in and went over my invoice from the first shop line by line with the person at the front desk. They said that while the first shop had charged me pretty standard prices for parts, the labor costs were, and here I quote, ""crazy."" In particular, they charged me \*triple\* just in labor costs for the thermostat what the other shop would have charged for parts, labor, and tax.

I thought I had missed something, especially since the first shop's quote for the fan was pretty close to what the second shop quoted me for the same job—maybe $150 or $200 higher, but not that different. Maybe I had just happened to walk into the world's most affordable mechanic. So to double-check, I called the local Nissan dealership's service department and asked them to give me a quote to replace the thermostat and water pump. Going by their service manual, they quoted me $1,043 before tax; while they said they couldn't guarantee that would be exactly what I would pay, it should be within $100 of it.

I'm kind of at a loss here, but I also consider myself to be a pretty reasonable person—I'm not the kind of customer who complains a lot—and before I go complain publicly about this shop, I want to do everything I can to make sure I'm in the right. I'd like to get a few actual mechanics' takes on this. My questions:

1. **Does their explanation of my problem—that my thermostat and water pump broke pretty much simultaneously, and that my cooling fan was working when they looked at it and crapped out days afterward to cause the same problem, ring true for you?** I understand none of you have looked at my car, but I'd like your gut opinion. Is this the kind of simultaneous failure something you see a lot? (I didn't ask for the parts they pulled back or I would test them myself.)
2. **Regarding what they billed me, is there a reasonable explanation that you can see for why they charged me so much?** I considered the possibility that maybe something was stuck—they had to drill out a bolt or something like that, and the second shop quoted me so much less because they didn't see that—but they didn't mention anything out of the ordinary and either way, I can't see that doubling or nearly doubling the price.
3. **I'm asking them to refund the second inspection fee and match the price that the dealership quoted me. Is that a reasonable ask, from your perspective?** I'm very, very skeptical that they'll actually give me any of my money back, but this shop has been professional and, I think, honest with the jobs I've had them do before—though from what I've gathered, they may have been under different management back then—and I want to offer a resolution before I go on Yelp or Google or wherever and tell my neighbors I wouldn't trust them to fix my lawnmower. Obviously they have the right to set the prices they see fit, but I've never used an independent shop that charged me more, or that much more at least, than a dealership."

2008 BMW 328i won’t start
Hello, I bought a 2008 bmw 328i from a guy 6
months ago and have had non stop problems ever
since. A week after I bought it, it just died out of no
where. We looked at the fuse box and every fuse
was horribly corroded, so we replace the fuse box
and cord and have it all new fuses. Changed the
fuel sensors as well And that fixed the problem.
Fast forward to a month later it started to idle
horribly at stop lights, so bad that it felt like
someone was shaking and pushing the car.
The next day it was fine, idle was fine so I took it to
the car wash and drove it home just fine. I go to
start it to leave and it starts shaking and so I turn it
off. I try to turn it on again to do tests and it won't
start. The lights come on but it won't turn over or
make a sound.. I try to turn it on the next day and
not even the lights will come on. Sol go to the
store and buy a new battery, once the battery got
replaced the lights come on but it won't turn over or
make a sound or anything.
Now a month later am trying to charge the battery
with a battery charger and it won't even try to
charge? I thought maybe the charger was bad but it
works on my 4Runner.
Any suggestions would be appreciated!!!"

Drive belt failure help
Hey there Reddit auto mechanics! Hoping someone can give me a little insight here. I have (had) a 2016 manual Kia Soul (~50k miles) that was having an issue with stalling while idling (red lights, stop signs, in a parking spot). No check engine light. In December I took it to a local Kia dealer/service center. They told me it was a timing issue. Took the engine apart and *supposedly* fixed this *supposed* timing issue (to the tune of $3k+) . Stalling kept happening and after a whoooole debacle of bringing it in and picking it up multiple times, they finally seemed to solve the problem by replacing a sensor. Pretty frustrating, and a total fiasco (one of the times I attempted to pick it up I couldn’t even drive it home because somehow a spark plug(s) went bad while in their care). 

Now, less than 3 months later, my car breaks down while I’m driving it, total engine shut down. We tow it back to the dealership and they tell me the drive belt failed and has cracked the timing cover. They are trying to charge me for diagnostics which involve opening the engine up again, maintaining that the drive belt failure has nothing to do with the work they did to the engine. The thing is that they looked at the drive belt as part of their initial service back in December and said it looked fine but that I should bring it in “in the next year or so” to check it as part of regularly scheduled maintenance. 

I know basically nothing about cars, but this whole things feels really fishy. I guess I have two questions-  
1. Is it possible that anything they would have done while addressing the timing could have resulted in the drive belt failure? 
2. Do they bear any responsibility for letting me drive away with a drive belt that was 3 months from failure? 

Would really appreciate any insight. Not sure what to do now, but I want to be armed with a better idea of what may have happened before I make any decisions, and feeling like I can’t/don’t trust them at this point. Thanks in advance!"

125 miles after repair, dead van from overheating
I took my 2006 Toyota Sienna minivan with 106k miles to the mechanic shop for A/C work.  I had been driving it 10 miles to and from work and was planning on giving it to a family member.  I asked the mechanic to check the brakes, change the oil, etc and make it ready to be presented as a gift.

He recharged the A/C, fixed a few other minor issues and then told me it was overheating.  He changed the thermostat, problem remained.  He quoted the price for a water pump & timing belt.  We got the money.  He replaced the water pump and timing belt, ran it a bit and said it was ready.  He told me the part that actually moved the water had broken off and was missing, so the water pump had not actually been moving water.  I drove it about 10 miles home.  Then, I transferred the title and insurance to my family member who drove her Christmas present 125 miles into a blown head gasket from overheating.  She had it for 2 hours of driving.  Got it towed and the other shop/tow company confirmed the head was deformed/cracked.  Radiator had coolant, no hoses showed leaks. That company charged $600 for all that (yikes!)

I declined the $500 offered as a 'compensation' from then first mechanic.  He went up on a Saturday and brought back the van.  He then checked the things he changed and found that his previous work was good (he's been trusted by my parents for 20+ years): timing belt is correct and pulled the water pump to make sure it pumped water.  He stated we can never know for sure what went wrong, but all he can think of is that maybe the head gasket was slightly leaking and just happened to go during a long drive 2 hours into the trip.

My questions are:  does it make sense?  Is there a reasonable chance that an engine overheating after getting a new thermostat and water pump is both not related to them and not something that should have been noticed (I don't know about such things)?  Are there other possibilities?  Could the missing part of the water pump have caused a blockage?  Maybe something else entirely?

Is it reasonable to want the mechanic to replace the value of the vehicle?  Is this something that should go to court, or is this a ""vehicles drop dead every day, it just happens.""

I'm frustrated that I put nearly $2000 into a vehicle repair that made the vehicle worth $3000 to $3500 and it died the next time it was driven."

Bald front tire rotation
I had a real problem today with a local dealership and I desperately need to know. I'll keep a long story short by first sharing the crux of the issue.

Dealership needed me to come back in after $2200 of work last week. They forgot to take pictures of a recall fix campaign they had done during the repair and asked if ""I'd bring the car back so they can take pics""? On my own time.

During the original repair they noticed my badly balding front tires and asked if I wanted them rotated (for $24 originally) and I agreed. They forgot and didnt rotate the tires and I didn't make a stink when I found out. When they called me to ask to bring the car back I asked if they would do the rotation and they offered to do it for no charge. Basic reciprocity at least.

Today I bring my car in for them, they take the pictures they need. Afterwards one of the sales guys is tasked with informing me the mechanic refuses to rotate my tires. He claims rotating the balding tires to the back is actually worse than having bald front tires and refuses to honor their agreement. 

Question: Do you think they actually believe its more dangerous to rotate bald tires to the back or do you think I was blown off because they didn't feel like rotating my tires and they weren't being paid?"

finicky transmission
question for the group; really appreciate the time and brain power you donate.  I own a genesis g80 AWD v6.   it has 90k miles. for the last year, it has 'jerked' in moving between gears. mostly 1st gear and 2nd.  however, it hasn't been consistent.  mostly recently it hasn't done it hardly at all.  other times its obvious.  i thought originally it was a warm/cold weather thing, but more recently i've started to doubt that.  i took it to the dealership and they drove it and told me i need a new transmission but they didn't do any diagnostics and it seemed like they were just trying to get rid of me.  And since then, the problem has greatly subsided.  They did charge me $200 for the diagnosis.  An acquaintance did plug in a system tester and it said i had no codes for engine or transmission- this and the fact that its a very inconsistent phenomenon has me 2nd guessing that a replacement tranny is what is needed.

my worry is changing the transmission with a local mechanic and than not actually fixing this 'lurching' thing i've been experiencing.  Any advice is appreciated.

\*\*UPDATE - i purchased a used transmission from a parts store (34k miles) and had a local mechanic install.  The issue is gone and the car runs smooth as butter."

Charging system problem.
Hi. I need help identifying this issue. I had the ""battery"" warning light come up yesterday. The battery rated at 12.6v with the car off, and 13.8v with the car on.

Today the car didn't want to turn on and did not make any type of noise when I turned over the key. I installed a new battery and the ""battery"" warning light went off and everything turned on fine.

However, when I turn on the AC, I noticed the ac fan blows harder under acceleration and slower when I let go of the gas pedal.

Correct me if I'm wrong, but does it sound like a bad alternator?"

Dealer Service Hustle and Shakedown
Went to dealer because my engine light came on. Was told it was a pas code for a misfire, to wipe code off. Ran me back $180. While doing that, they suggested I buy new tires and brake pads. If I get that, the $180 goes away. But the tires and brakes were extremely expensive. 

Few days later (less than a week), car doesn’t start up. Engine light on, car barely starts. I tow it to the same dealer, am told “the car is flooded” and they discovered a rodents nest. Takes them 4-5 hours to “retrace wires” (nothing damaged) to see if it was anything else and clean out the nest. Replaced thermostat and put coolant. $625. 

5 days later, engine light back on. Of course I’m a little confused because it’s the same code from the original issue…they saying they’d have to look at it again… but want to charge me claiming the engine is huge and they can’t determine the problem. I call BS. But would love feedback. Will probably call corporate, but want to make sure I’m not over exaggerating. I brought it in initially for diagnostic because of the engine light, and they said not to worry about it nothing was found. But once I didn’t do the tires — so many things are now “wrong”. & I think they decided to focus on the more expensive easy fix (cosmetic) part of the car and not the internal issues.

Recap: car was taken into service on 3 occasions in the span of 2 weeks and each time charged to locate problem at the official Dealer Service department.

anything to watch for,
2 months ago had chev dealership put on both sepertine  belt and stretch belt for ac on 09 tahoe when the airbag recall was being finally being done.
Last night when home for the day and heard a engine noise that  came from engine .
When looking  as car was running you could see the stretch  belt had started to fay and you could see a flap on a edge.

Called dealership  ship and told them and that a 2 month old belt  had gone bad and needed to be changed at no charge  to me.

Fine just bring it here they said.

Headed out to dealer ship and 5 minutes later main serpentine  belt as best as a i can tell was pulled off its pulleys its not broke or frayed that I can see but also found a small pencil lead piece of stretch belt that had ripped off that one.
So no alternater no power steering  no water  pump working.
I was on a road that has no shoulders to pull off and had to limp 2-3 miles to a wide spot that I could get car off the road.
By that time car was saying overheating. And all sorts of warnings and had gone into limp mode.
Called dealership  ship but they don't have tow truck 
I was mad as hell and said your 2 month old belts break and you want me to pay to bring it to you?
They finally agreed that if they feel the belt caused the issue issue they would pay tow.
So now tahoe is at dealership  and they gave me  loner to use but won't be able to work on until Monday.
I did notice that passenger front wheel inner  area was soaking in antifreeze  from over  heating is my quess. 

Main questions  being that it got hot. And drove for 2 -3 miles  could it have done major damage  to engine?

 could there be problems  that could or should be looked at now or that I should watch closely?

Is there anything i should do proactively  now Oil change or ? Ect ect

And if so what should I watch out for 

My thoughts are that they should be responsible  for any issue that could have happened due to overheating and fix all issues.
Do you feel that the dealership  ship should take responsibility  on it?

Update.
Got tahoe  back today. Being change oil light was on they changed the oil and filter (last oil change was 3 weeks ago) and replaced stretch  belt 
All sounds  good now so will watch for any noises  or change in engine performance. 
Want to thank everyone who took the time to reply

Thanks !"

Starter or battery
I have a 2015 Silverado, and a couple nights ago it wouldn’t start, didn’t even try to crank or anything just a click and that was it, then I went out a couple hours later and it started right up. The next day it started, I made it to work fine and when I left it wouldn’t start again. I tried jumping it and nothing. I check the charge of the battery and it was 12.5. I sat around waiting for AAA trying to start it a few times and nothing for like an hour and a half and then all of the sudden it started right up again. I made it home fine but I’m trying to avoid taking it to work again till I figure what the problem is"

What could cause an ‘08 Honda Civic Hybrid to not turn over?
A couple of months ago, I bought this Civic Hybrid and I should’ve smelled trouble when the price was a bit lower than what the car should’ve gone for. My dad and I, who knows a hell of a lot of about cars just not the hybrid/electrics, test drove it with the owner.

During that test drive, we didn’t see any major red flags at the time. These older was honest about the hybrid battery not being perfect, we actually ended up buying a charger that’s supposed to help extend the life of the battery, but he wasn’t honest about other things.

He told us the car had a problem with a coolant leak, that he didn’t have the ability to fix as he didn’t have a place to properly work on the car. He claimed he had to top of the coolant level at least once a week. That wasn’t much of a problem, as my dad was confident that was something he could fix.

A week later when my dad was able to work on the car, he found out that the radiator had been damaged. Looked like some had hit the car head on, because the steel part of the bumper looked like it caused the damage to the radiator. So we replace that.

A couple weeks go by and the car starts having an overheating problem. We found out the radiator fans weren’t coming on, because of the two radiator sensors seemed to be malfunctioning. When he removed it, the fans ran but the coolant wasn’t circulating correctly. So in an effort to mitigate it, my dad removed the thermostat to allow it too continuously circulate. He wasn’t worried about a big problem since with it being 80°+ degreees everyday it wouldn’t do much harm. But we’d also need to replace the thermostat because it was bad.

Work for a couple weeks, and then started overheating like crazy again. My dad found out the water pump needed to be replaced. And he was surprised it lasted as long as it did, because the cracks on it looked like they’d been there for a long while. For a while it started working fine, and then it had an overheating problem yet again.

After taking the whole hood compartment apart, my dad found the head gaskets needed replacing. Did that, and when he put everything back together the car refused to turn over. He thought it might’ve been either/both the batteries so we charged both, but nada.

More work down the line, he discovered three of the four ignition coils were bad. Hell, the car started up fine with just the one good coil. Although, I wasn’t stupid enough to drive it like that, lol.

Fast forward, three new ignition coils were installed and the car started up without a hitch. Yesterday I drove the car, and had no issues with it at first. However, after about an hour after I turned the vehicle off it wouldn’t successfully turn over anymore, but it trying to start.

I’d started the car up twice before, once when I started and the second after I test drove it for thirty minutes to see if any problems showed up. Nothing seemed wrong, and the car ran almost perfectly and better than it had since I’ve owned it. Our CReader isn’t showing any fault codes, but I did notice there was a weird gasoline-like smell when I tried to start the car after it started acting up.

If anyone has any insight, I do appreciate anything you have to offer. Thank you."

Weird electrical problems cant tell if battery..fuse..wiring or alternator
94 dakota sport.
Car has been sitting over a month now..
Sometimes I'll go out there and open the door and the dome light comes on out of nowhere. I try to turn the key it cuts off.

We jumped it off not too long ago...

And strange things were happening .. the rpm ..gas and other gauges were fluctuating or fluttering.
My brother knows a good bit about mechanicing our dad has been a mechanic for over 50 years. 
My brother seems to think it's the alternator..
My dad said dont rule out a dead battery just yet... 

During the time we jumped it I let it run for 30 mins and shut it off. And ebeyrvtubt was totally dead again so I'm leaning towards the alternator or some other electrical problem as well..

I had bought a aftermarket radio from a sketchy yard sale and we tried to install it to find out it was bad.. had nothing to but back in it place as the factory one had just basically deteriorated...

Just looking for any advice I can.. I'm sick of walking and sick of not being able to just get away from the house. Only time I get to leave the house is work and its driving me crazy but I'm not sure what the problem is.

I do HVAC work..well right not I'm apprenticing to be a service tech so I have a meter and stuff..

Problem is money is tight rn cause its florida ""winter"" one day cold af one day warm one day nothing business has been slow so I cant afford to go out and buy a battery charger to charge the battery and get it tested. 

Can get an alternator from junk yard for 25 bucks but it's been hell to get someone to take me there . I live I  jacksonville which is the largest city in the u.s. land wise everything is spread out so far apart. 

Anyways any pro opinions would be greatly appreciated.

These older trucks are wired funky as hell as is so I kinda feel like it's a needle in the haystack kinda thing.. also just fyi the belt on the alternator is fine."

Plz help before I set my car on fire!
So I have a 2000 mustang, 6 cyl 3.8ltr (I know believe me I wish it was a V8 too, yet it is not)  so the car was running well until it sat for 9 months and developed some issues. I had to put new exhaust manifolds, breaks and roters, AC clutch and compressor, repair the starter, and I thought alternator and battery. So here is my current issue, after I changed the battery and put a used alternator on it the car is still acting like it has a power distribution issue. Spuddering, and no dash lights or gauges; But it still idols weakly. However if I turn on the headlights or fan or put a load of any type on the engine it dies immediately. Leading me to believe the used alternator I got was bad, so I went and bought a brand new one fully expecting it to fix the problem but had no progress what so ever.By this point the car will only run with jumper cables attached, the brand new alternator is providing 0 Entergy to the car and 0 charge to the brand new battery. So I began to look at the positive lead from the alternator to the post on the side of the fuse box where the battery, engine, and alternator leads all 3 meet.  So I inspected the Alternators output wire and found it had been poorly spliced together, and with it being the only thing between the alternator and the 2 things not receiving it's output, naturally I replaced the shitty wire with a new high quality battery wire expecting it to allow a healthy flow of energy. But no, again the symptoms remain the same. I am at a loss I thought maybe a fuse or relay but there are no fuses on the path it is all straight wiring. Does anyone know what could possibly be causing this power distribution issue?"

Do you need a new 12v car battery?
I have a 2007 Toyota Yaris sedan. My Duralast Gold battery is a little over 5 years old. I just took it to autozone and had it all tested. The service guy said it had ""96%"" charge and that I should replace it with in two weeks. I have not had any sort of electric issues such as starting problems and my battery service light on dashboard has never lit up. he said my alternator was good though and passed OBD2 scan with no errors. Do I really need to replace my battery? Can I use one of those trickle chargers to bring up to 100%? Would filling the cells with water help extend its life? The price of the same battery model is almost $200. I think the gold may be over kill for my car but some of the more cheaper one were in $140 range. i remember I got it for like $120ish. How much more life/time do you think I can get with my battery.  If you think I do need a new battery would Costco be a better alternative? They have Interstate batteries and they seem much more affordable then autozones."

Hi automotive professionals.

My question is I know they are reliable but are there any common issues I should watch for? I have no mechanic experience. I can check oil and stuff but other than that I'm just listening and guessing. They have the same 1.5L engine and are both automatic.

My needs are simple. Reliable and can fit me my girl and my German shepherd. I drive at most 9k miles a year maybe less. I need it to last a couple weeks with no issues or I won't have money to fix it. I need the car overall to last about 3 years without calling it quits for good.

Has Hyundai's Hybrid Engine's gotten better since 2022?
Was looking to switch from my 2022 Rav4 Hybrid LE (families been Toyota forever) mostly because the unbearable road noise and outdated interior. So I started looking around and pretty much every compact SUV has the same interior and conveniences when I look at the Honda CR-V, Rav4, or 2025 Mazda CX50 (which now has a Toyota Engine). 

For the most part I value reliability, ease of maintenance, and fuel efficiency. So I went around test driving a few, and I came across the 2024 Hyundai Tuscon Hybrid Limited, and man it checks all the boxes I wish my Rav4 had checked when I bought it (and for the same damn price too) 

But everything I've ever been told is that Hyundai is up there when it comes to recalls (though the service manager there said a lot of it is software updates), or mechanics always list them in their list of least reliable brands, or that the engines were failing all the time. Just hoping for someone to shed some light on if newer Hyundai Hybrids are more reliable then they used to be or if I should just stick with my ol reliable, Rav4. Thanks. "

Car Inspection 
Does anyone know a good reliable and not a thief when it comes to car inspections in the Philadelphia area, Bucks County area? 

Reason I ask is I have gone to the same guys who I use to golf with and they were just starting out and they were very decent, plus my car was only a year an old. So instead of going to the dealer where it’s free ( but they always find something) I went to my golfing buddies new business. Well that was 6 years ago and after the first two years it was every inspection I needed brakes or rotors or both. No problem I’ll deal with it, but lately it’s like 500, 1000, 1500 or more. Then the last time I went he tried to tell me it’s going to cost like 3 k or more I might need a new engine because my car was burning oil. Well let’s just say that was pure BS. He must have forgotten I worked on cars myself for 10-15 years while being a plumber which is a mechanic but different field obviously. Long story short they were once honest and now they’re picking and choosing who they are going to fuck over! Car never leaked or burned 1 oz of oil just a flat out lie. So I’m just looking for an honest car mechanic who I will give all my family business to which is a rather large family. No problem paying for actual car issues, but not paying for made up just want to generate cash because you’re a thief. 

So if anyone is out there that can recommend. Greatly appreciated. And let me tell you, when I was younger and raising my 5 children I did a bunch of side work. Never once did I screw any customers. In fact I knew they were getting a deal when they hiring me to install or repair any plumbing. When you are billing 1/4-1/3 of what I made at my job for side work I know I wasn’t F’ing anyone. Just not the way I was raised. Karma is a bitch for some!

Mechanic Opinions on Subaru vs Volvo
TLDR: I’m looking for the inside scoop on  common issues with Volvo (mainly new XC40) from people who actually work with the cars since all the content online seems to just be noise.

—

My investigation into this was primarily sparked by helping someone shop for a new car. Volvo XC40 looks very attractive for their needs. The other contenders are Subaru Crosstrek and Outback.

I’ve always heard that Subaru are very very reliable, but I don’t know much about Volvo and everything I’ve been able to find on the internet seems to just be unhelpful noise and be all over the place.

With a Volvo what are the most common issues? Are they well made? Is the extra cost of repair too big of a risk? How does it compare to Subaru?"

2013 Hyundai Elantra GT - Replacement AC Compressor
Hello Hello, So I’m planning on replacing the AC Compressor in my car. I’ve looked up tutorial videos on how it’s done and it seems relatively easy.

The air coming out when the AC is on is hot. I purchased one of those “recharge bottles” but the valve said it was full (needle was in the green) so I didn’t add any. The AC went from cold to hot probably within a week (maybe more or less time. It’s been a while since it started blowing hot air. This happened last fall so I haven’t needed AC until now.)

Couple questions. (I’m going to research everything I’m going to ask, but I’d like opinions and facts from actual peoples.)

When removing the old AC compressor, how do I check if it’s “full”? I know the recharge bottle said it’s full, but what’s a good gauge to invest in to get a true reading?

If I remove the AC compressor will the refrigerant spill out of the compressor or lines? Do I need to drain anything prior to removing the old AC Compressor? (I use the words “spill out” loosely because I know refrigerant can take either a gaseous or liquid state.)

If the car is off, and the AC is off, are any of the lines under pressure?

What’s a good store/website to get a reliable AC Compressor?

When purchasing an AC Compressor, what are some things to be aware of?

Do new AC compressors come filled, or do you need to fill them/get them filled? Can I simply fill the new one with the “recharge bottle”? (I figured the new one is empty, but just wanted to check.)

Aside from the compressor going bad, what are things to check that could be the culprit for it blowing hot air? Possibly a nicked line? Bad gasket that’s leaking refrigerant?

Lastly, Do you know of any nuances to make the job easier or anything to keep an eye out for? I’m an industrial mechanic by trade, so running a machine is one thing but when I train operators/maintenace I always give heads up on nuances to be aware of to make everyone’s life easier.

If I’ve missed a valuable question, please enlighten me on your wisdom ole wise Reddit peeps.

I appreciate your time! Enjoy the weekend!

Help - Tried everything unable to figure out the issue - Hyundai Elantra 2018
Hello everyone,

I am writing to seek assistance in addressing a persistent issue with my vehicle. Despite having replaced several key components, including the battery, alternator, fuel pump assembly, spark plugs, and crank sensor, and having undergone carbon cleaning and an engine oil change performed by a qualified mechanic, the problem remains unresolved.

Specifically, the vehicle fails to start reliably, encountering difficulties approximately 60% of the time. 

It is important to note that once the vehicle is successfully turned on, it operates without any issues. The problem solely occurs during the ignition process.

I would greatly appreciate your expertise and guidance in rectifying this matter. 

Any insights or recommendations you may have would be invaluable in resolving this ongoing concern."

2016 Chevy equinox 2.4 liter 4 cylinder weird engine noise 
I noticed my car making this noise a couple days ago. Happens between 600-2000 rpm. Today in a parking felt and sounded to me like  it wanted to stall.  I know these cars are not known for reliability but I need it to last atleast another year. Any suggestions for diagnosis. No warning lights and 140k miles with regular oil changes. "

Engine Review
Preface - I'm not a mechanic, just someone who likes cars. 

I wanna know more about the F136 Ferrari V8. 

I have a stupid idea, I wanna engine swap a 120 Toyota Landcrusier and thought about this after seeing that impressive Ferrari swapped Subaru WRX. 

Talk to me about reliability, if it'll fit, possible bushings and suspension changes to account for the extra power.

Edit - Costs would be preferable, located in Australia

Edit 2 - Yes it is definitely a thought exercise.

Edit 3 - Slightly more serious, what engines would you recommend (cost effective of course unlike my funny idea above) "

1998 honda accord
I have a 1998 honda accord with the 4cyl. It has been a reliable car dor the past 5 years but recently i drove it to work and it wont start anymore. 
It drove to work that day perfectly fine no issues when i pulled into the parking lot I noticed the instrument cluster lights were kind of pulsing brighter and dimmer. Anyway when i got off work i tried to start the car and the entire instrument cluster not has no lights at all and it just cranks but no start. I have replaced the fuel pump relay and also i have changed the Ignition control module and still not running. I checked all of the fuses in the car and none of them are blown. I do not know what else to check and i cant afford any mechanic at the moment any information would be greatly appreciated"

DIY auto mechanic. Sometime flipper. Bought an Autel MX808, but can’t justify the $125/year subscription. What’s a great no-subscription OBDII reader I can get?
Used to have a $30 Innova 3030 and it was dead simple and reliable. Get the P-codes, Google them, and fix the issue. I thought the Autel would open a new world of troubleshooting for me, but I don’t use it nearly enough to justify the yearly subscription price. I’d use it 1-2 times a year generally. Looking for a good quality tool I can replace my Autel with for the next few years."

Is there another transmission I can put in an 06 Acura TL?
I posted a similar question in the Acura forum, so I hope I'm not breaking the rules here.  

I  bought my parents an 06 TL because they needed some reliable  transportation.  As a Honda product I expected it to be more reliable,  but yeah ...  So that was my mistake.

Anyway,  the transmission seems to be shot.  (I haven't had it to a mechanic yet  because I'll have to go get it and trailer it, but my dad got the code read and tried to fix the  ""little"" stuff and it's still not shifting.)  I'm going to get it looked  at but want to be prepared with a plan in case the transmission does  have to be replaced since it's a known issue in this car.

The mechanic  who works on my Honda told me that local transmission shops don't rebuild those transmissions, so getting it rebuilt may not be possible.  I can find some used ones, but they're really expensive, and worse, since it's a known issue, I'd be headed down the same road again in a few months to a couple of years, which doesn't really seem worth it.

Are  there transmissions that can go in that car other than the one it came  with?  I've seen some guys suggest in Acura forums that there's a Honda  Accord transmission that is compatible.  Is that true?  Are there others?  Is that something a normal transmission shop can do? "

08 Honda Ody mystery clank
I have tried submitting a video several times but it isn't working. If this posts, I will reply with the video of the sound.
I have a 2008 Honda Odyssey with a clank or double click sound when I turn the wheel. It is most frequent when I am turning from a stop sign. Sometimes it happens when I am stationary. Yesterday I could replicate it somewhat reliably by driving in a slow tight circle repeatedly then stopping and turning the wheel the other direction.
It only happens when the weather is warmer or hot. This has been happening for 2 summers and no one can figure it out.
I just had control arms replaced yesterday and it is still clanking.
If it was just a sound, but safe to drive-in can live with that. I am a single mom and this is what I drive daily with my son.

Recommendations for a full-size truck that is the most reliable
Hello all.  I recently bought a 2022 F150 hybrid with the 3.5L power boost engine.  That thing has had nonstop problems from auxiliary transmission pump failure to shifting issues that needed reprogrammed to my most recent which is some fault with the hybrid system that’s being looked at now.  I drive probably 35-40k miles a year and want something reliable.  I was planning to trade it in as I just don’t trust it at this point.  In the newer F150 trucks, is the V8 a more reliable build than the turbo V6?  Also, are there other trucks such as a Chevy Silverado or Ram that may have a better build quality?  I was hoping somebody may have had some experience and could speak to this.  Maybe I was just unlucky and the Ford is a good machine, I’m just not certain at this point.  Thanks for any insight you can give!"

Powertstop carbon fiber ceramic blend brakes vs Anything/all Akebono pads
I think Scotty Kilmore said that carbon fibers the only material that as it heats up it, it's performs better. That's why it's only used on airplanes because they're expensive and I'm assuming solid carbon fiber.

Rock Auto lists them as a premium option but I haven't seen anything I'd consider reliable or better than akebonos reputation.

From some reviews on paper as great of an idea the CarbonCeramic blend might be.
I've come across a few reviews relating to quality control. Which can always be just corporate Sabotage.

Anyone have experience with Carbonfiber Ceramic brake pads and compare them to Akebonos or anything crucially relevant to braking?"

Most repairable cars
Hey everyone,

I'm curious to hear your thoughts on which cars are most repairable by the DIYer. Some of the things that I think help are: 1. Easy access to engine bay, 2. Plenty of space to work, everything's not crammed in so tight, 3. Manual vs. electronic systems are generally easier to work on (e.g. an actual throttle cable vs. electronic throttle system), 4. Infotainment systems have the potential for expensive failures.

So far, 1997 Buick LeSabre has been very easy to work on, and also very reliable, with not much going wrong. Here are a few questions for you:

* What is the newest model year you can buy without getting too many difficult to repair or expensive to repair electronics?
* Are there any makes/models that are particularly challenging to work on, or particularly easy to work on?
* Do you find the computers in cars to be generally reliable? I'm thinking systems like blind spot monitoring, forward collision braking, adaptive cruise control, rear parking sensors, infotainment screens, etc? I look at the average new car and as an electrical engineer, I think to myself, ""That's a bunch of cheap electronics just waiting to break and cause endless headaches/money pits down the road. Just give it 100,000 miles or so...but what do you see out in the field?

Thanks!"

Diagnostic Fee for 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis
Is $222.82 pretty high for a diagnostic fee on a 2003 Mercury Grand Marquis? They wanted $1200 to repair it but decided to get a used car with less miles since my husband has a long commute and needed something reliable. This auto place (small, family owned) wants $222.82 before they'll release the car to the salvage yard! I expected to pay a fee but not that high! My brother in law recommended this place.

2010 F150 died while towing, no codes
I'm trying to sleuth what went wrong with my 2010 F150 yesterday. 5.4 litre engine + towing package. Rated for 11k pounds of towing capacity.

We were driving back from a few days of camping at the beach, towing a 29' trailer weighing about 8,500 pounds. We'd been on the road for about 40 minutes without any difficulties at all. All gauges were normal. I saw a slight incline in the road ahead so I gave it some gas, nothing happened. I tried giving it gas a few times and it clearly revved up, but still lost power so I pulled off onto the shoulder and the motor died without me turning off the key. Tried turning the key a few times, over the next thirty minutes or so but it would not turn over. Check engine light came on so I pulled out my ODB2 reader and there were no new codes. I thought it was seized and motor was toast. 

We ended up having the truck towed a couple of hours away to my mechanic. When they got to it a few hours later, it started up no problem and seems to run just fine.

Can you please help me figure out what went wrong? I really need to get to the bottom of this once and for all. I spoke with the mechanic today and he seemed pretty stumped by the whole thing. 

Recent mechanical history is as follows:

1.  Truck has 173k km on it, never had a single problem with it until this winter when exhaust manifold cracked. 100% reliable, never a single code. 

2. Mechanic had truck in for 5 weeks as they had to pull the motor to drill out the bolts to replace the exhaust manifold. 

3.  After getting truck back it ran very rough when warmed up, triggered codes P0012 and P0022 so we replaced both the VVT solenoids which seemed to solve the problem beautifully.

4. Had the oil changed and the air conditioning compressor replaced while it was in for the solenoid replacement.

5.  Had never pulled the trailer with the truck until a week ago. 

5. Truck towed the trailer to the beach on Tuesday with no problem, all gauges were normal and it handled the fully loaded trailer excellently. We unhitched the truck and used it several times to run around over the course of the week."

Tips for finding a mechanic?
I'm a female in my late twenties and dont know a whole lot about cars.

Some of my coworkers mentioned how they have a side mechanic who does work for them on the side but they are super secretive about giving me their info or recommending one to me.

1.2 TSI (CBZ) runs perfect cold, revs at 90°C, won’t start when warm – no fault codes
Hi all,
I’ve been trying to diagnose a frustrating issue on my 2011 Seat Leon Mk2 1.2 TSI (engine code CBZ) for the past two months. Hoping someone here can help or has seen this before.

The problem:
	•	Car runs perfect from cold, no issues up to 89°C
	•	As soon as it hits 90°C, the revs surge or become erratic
	•	If I switch it off at 90°C, it cranks but won’t restart
	•	After letting it cool down (20–30 mins), it starts again like nothing happened
	•	No check engine light, and no stored fault codes (even after the issue)

What’s been done so far:
	•	O2 sensor replaced
	•	Crankshaft sensor replaced
	•	Coolant temperature sensor (CTS) replaced
	•	Throttle body cleaned
	•	Cooling fans work properly
	•	Timing belt and water pump recently replaced

Other symptoms:
	•	Once it hits 90°C and the issue starts, it may crank and fire weakly but dies after a few seconds
	•	One time it restarted but had no throttle response (like limp mode)
	•	Happens consistently, no matter how gently I drive it

Suspected camshaft sensor — seems like a classic heat-related failure, but I’d like a second opinion before I replace it.

Anyone seen this on the 1.2 TSI (CBZ engine) before?
Is there anything else I should check first?"

Need help with a stripped tie rod bolt
It won’t let me upload a video for some reason. 

What are my options? Thinking of getting an angle grinder and cutting through it at this point. Put a jack underneath, but that didn’t help, ball joint still kept spinning. Put a 10mm on the top and that worked until that eventually stripped too. Nut splitter was trash. It sat in PB Blaster for a whole day before I even started, and still the nut barely wants to spin. Must be some serious thread locker or something. And recommendations? If I go the angle grinder route, any brands that’s well made to cut through this? I would assume it’s hardened metal, at least the ball joint part of it. 

The Nylock nut is not stripped although it looks like it.

2.0 L Turbo 5 speed manual transmission as a repossessed vehicle from a loan center. it didn’t start when i purchased it but it would turn on not to mention the key they gave us wasn’t the original key. while it was turned on, what i would assume to be the immobilizer light illuminated and wouldn’t go off. it doesn’t crank over, matter of fact it doesn’t make any sound when you try to turn it over for that matter. i took it to a volkswagen dealership and they wasted 3 months of my time $400 of my money just to  “diagnose” it (which they failed to do). told me they couldn’t figure out why it won’t turn on but SOMEHOW magically were able to program the key. which they lied about wasting another 2 weeks and $300😐 so at this point im pretty lost on what to do. do i need to take out the ECU and find someone to disengage the immobilizer. another thing whoever owned the car previously ripped out the stereo leaving all this nasty looking wires, could that have messed something up? if someone knows what to do and maybe where i should start please offer advice. i just wanna get this car 100% so i can make it nice "

Battery just replaced now engine won’t start
Had a bad battery and wrongfully drove it until the engine just quit. Tried to make it home but failed. I just got a new battery in
it and tried starting it first time but just
made clunking noises and maybe one
or two cylinders fired. Second time it
turns over freely but doesn’t even fire. 
Tried this 5-6 times but nothing fires. 
No bad noises but doesn’t fire on any
cylinders. Before putting the new 
battery in I drained the charge in the
system by removing the battery cables
and turning on the headlights with 
the old battery disconnected. I left it
overnight that way. So I put in the new 
battery and it doesn’t start as stated
above. Question is how can I get it
started? What’s wrong? Did I mess up 
the timing or something else? 
Anyone have some ideas? 
Thanks a million for any insight!! "

Hide a key problem
I have a 2020 Ford T250 with normal start, not remote start, and four key fobs. I’d like to have a key hidden outside my vehicle in case I lock myself out. I have not been able to find a hide-a- key box wide enough to store the entire fob. I’m wondering if there is an easy way to disassemble one of the key fobs and just remove the metallic key to put inside a key box. I’ve opened the back of one fob to expose the battery, and there is a small Alan bolt at one end and the silver part at the other end of the fob does seem like it can be  manipulated with the screwdriver but it won’t completely come off. I prefer not to destroy the key fob if possible so I’m a bit hesitant to proceed. Does anyone know how to disassemble the key fob and remove the key or have other ideas for hiding a key on my van in this situation?"

I’ve got a problem with my car that I don’t know how to fix, please help!
as the title says- I’m rather new to this whole car thing as I’ve only recently got my drivers license. I drive a Peel P50 which has randomly broken down whilst i was driving it in the middle of the highway. when I try to start my car (with my keys) it won’t start, and it makes a harsh whirring noise instead. I tried kicking it but it doesnt fix the car- only makes it worse. If someone could tell me what’s wrong, that would be great help! Thanks."

Looking for Help 🙏🏻
Hi all. I’ve recently started a new business, and funds are tight right now. They won’t be for long but I’ve got an issue with one of my cars. I’ve always owned trucks. I have a 2016 Ram 1500. I love this truck, will keep it forever. Took it to a new mechanic and he said ALL FOUR control arms and ball joints need to be replaced to pass inspection. What are the chances of this? especially considering I’ve never had an issue with this truck, and have always passed state inspection no problem (last year!). I have a small amount of knowledge from working on cars with my dad as a kid. Replacing drum breaks, radiators, brake pads, etc. but I need help…are these guys trying to clobber me or what? Replacing control arms and ball joints is a rare thing. All 4?Truck has 90k miles. Any information/insight greatly appreciated 🙏🏻"

Car won’t start. Brake system
I just replaced the pads on my 2016 Honda Accord. Now the dash is flashing and the car won’t start. It flashes with various patterns from slow flash to quick pulsating. Including the Brake System light. 

The caliper piston was very difficult to push back in. Even though the reservoir cap was removed and there was room for the fluid to expand.

Some reading says I need to bleed the lines or replace the master cylinder.

How can I check if the master cylinder or some other component has an issue."

2008 BMW 328i won’t start
Hello, I bought a 2008 bmw 328i from a guy 6
months ago and have had non stop problems ever
since. A week after I bought it, it just died out of no
where. We looked at the fuse box and every fuse
was horribly corroded, so we replace the fuse box
and cord and have it all new fuses. Changed the
fuel sensors as well And that fixed the problem.
Fast forward to a month later it started to idle
horribly at stop lights, so bad that it felt like
someone was shaking and pushing the car.
The next day it was fine, idle was fine so I took it to
the car wash and drove it home just fine. I go to
start it to leave and it starts shaking and so I turn it
off. I try to turn it on again to do tests and it won't
start. The lights come on but it won't turn over or
make a sound.. I try to turn it on the next day and
not even the lights will come on. Sol go to the
store and buy a new battery, once the battery got
replaced the lights come on but it won't turn over or
make a sound or anything.
Now a month later am trying to charge the battery
with a battery charger and it won't even try to
charge? I thought maybe the charger was bad but it
works on my 4Runner.
Any suggestions would be appreciated!!!"

Need help
I’m an auto tech student and we got a 2005 ford freestyle and before EGR and spark plugs were replaced there was pressure in the fuel gadge but now there is spark but no pressure! I tried bypassing the fuel pump driver module and smell oil (it has clean new oil also) but still no pressure and the car won’t start! Any ideas ?"

Car Battery Low When Car Is Turned Off
Hey all, hope someone can help me. My car battery works well when car is turn on (14.5), so, obviously, alternator is fine. However, it drains to 10 v when I turn the car off (and this is instantaneous).
Car is a 2015 Equinox. Just bought a new battery 2 weeks ago and noticed this on Saturday when car won’t start. Please help!"

Not repair related but technician life related at a dealership. Need collective input.
This isn’t anything to do with help on a repair, however more a collective question because I see on here many skilled individuals and seek to get a insight due to a certain individual I work with.
I have a lube tech at my job, and he followed me to the new place I work at. Mind you I wasn’t thrilled but, I cannot control that in the slightest.
He’s been a lube tech for four years now. Pretty long time. 
He’s lazy. Doesn’t clean up after himself. Doesn’t take trash out. Clean up tires…he basically thinks he can do nothing but touch a car and dump and pump oil all day long. But he constantly complains about not getting paid enough and wants his own tools. (To the point he’s going in peoples boxes to borrow theirs and not ask. He’s lost a pair of pliers of mine already so when I step away from my box I have to lock it)
My question is, even if one has a shop helper how many of you started off as a lube tech? Was it apart of your learning experience to help out in the shop maintain cleanliness, help others around you and maintain good habits?
If so please can you tell me in detail what it is that you did during your time? Because I want to use this as a point of reference the next time he picks fights. 
I’m sure he won’t last long but I want there to be a point that this profession you don’t get something for nothing, try and respect the people and place you work in and being a lube tech is a stepping stone. You work harder than sometimes necessary to garner opportunities to advance."

Setting the timing on an 86 Nissan d21 3.0L
As stated above I have a d21 when I shine a timing light down there the marks that should line up with the arrow on the engine are way off like if they are supposed to be at 12 o clock they are at 9 o’clock. Is the pulley bad or wrong? I know that when you install a crankshaft pulley there’s a key way in it so it can only go in one way and the truck starts and runs smooth but it won’t pass smog inspection with because apparently it’s a visual test and it failed. I’ve heard to actually check and set the timing there maybe be something that has to be plugged in or disconnected like the throttle position sensor or something of the sort. But was hoping to get a little bit more specific information on it. Anything helps guys thanks"

2007 Nissan Titan no crank or start.
So I’m cooking my girlfriend cheeseburgers right now but. I’ve been working with a Nissan Titan all day. I replaced the battery and it started all nice and dandy than I went to Walmart didn’t start at all, fucked around with it multiple times till I started it. Went home slept and decided to replace the negative terminal after that tho clicks when ignition is turned. Sometimes even turning off completely. 
I’ve been told multiple ways that include tapping the starter when my girl turns ignition to ecm relay replacement. To fuel pressure not working and to put a knife or file in between gap in positive terminal 
anyone have ideas or opinions on how I would be able to start it. 
Oh yeah also when I use my jumper pack it won’t turn over or even do anything."

2011 MB C300 4matic Sport
My check engine light came on a few weeks ago and it looks like a solenoid needs to be replaced. I wanted to learn how to replace it myself, since I’ve been wanting to learn how to do some of the maintenance on the car myself as I am an engineer by trade and I find it interesting. I bought an OBDII scanner and have tried to run it about a dozen different times. I’ve read the entire manual now cover to cover and can’t understand why it won’t connect. I keep getting “link error” from the OBDII scanner. I did try it on my boyfriend’s VW golf and it worked perfect. 

This morning, however, my radio presets started being jumbled (i.e. if I press 9 it brings it to the 6 preset and if I press 0 it brings it to the 5 preset, etc.). I’ve done some research, but couldn’t find this same issue online. Could this be a blown fuse? I’ve read that a reason the OBDII scanner can get the link error if there’s a blown fuse. 

Thanks for any help!"

Help - My manual transmission doesn’t want to stay in fifth gear!
I drive a 2012 Scion xB now at 174k miles. A few weeks ago it started very occasionally popping out of third gear, usually while going up hill. Today it won’t stay in fifth… I should add that I had the clutch replaced back in May.

Any suggestions what might be causing this and what I might expect when I bring it in to the transmission shop?"

Car won’t start, no click, ignition switch/cylinder?
Toyota Corolla 2010 ignition switch/cylinder

So after getting home from the store with no previous issues, my car was dead.

Battery giving 12.4v and is fine. 

Once ignition to spot III, power goes dead, no audible click, interior power fades, car doesn’t start. 

After changing out the ignition switch, same problem! Place meter on red and black wiring, once in position III 12.4 volts drop to ZERO. 

Could this be an issue with the ignition cylinder also??? 

All steps I’ve done and everything I read was looking to be the switch... Now I’m at a loss and have the slightest idea of the problem. 

I’m thinking it could also or primarily be the cylinder now but am not entirely sure.

Any mechanics here or someone that has been through this issue?"

Idle problems 2001 GMC Sierra
I have an 01 Sierra, about 120,000 miles on it. I’ve had this truck since 2013, it’s been a great truck so far. Today I noticed while idling the truck just slightly shakes, it’s very faint, but maybe like it wants to shut off. About 15 minutes later the check engine light came on, and flashed a few times, then at one point the check engine light turned off, but then a minute later it came back on. I started googling things and saw that if the check engine light flashes then that means it is serious and needs to be taken to the shop ASAP.  I’m of course worried about the cost, since times are rough right now, and I don’t have the money to throw at it. I am due for my inspection and registration, so I was planning to get it inspected at the shop tomorrow, but I know it won’t pass the emissions test with the check engine light on. 

Any suggestions on what may be the cause, and costs to fix?  

I’m a chick who loves trucks, but don’t know Jack about them! (Not that women are incompetent, it’s just me, I’m incompetent!)"

04 Chevy Tahoe electrical and/or tune issues?
I have a 04 Tahoe 180k miles, cammed, tunned also has a prestige after market alarm.
it’s going nuts. 
It started with my ac only blowing cold when driving, then my battery started dying (changed alternator and battery), then when I’d try to turn it on it’ll click like a dead battery but then will start after few tries. But would die when I was pulling out or into a parking spot (low RPS) now I just got in it and it clicked a few times then after the third attempt it started. Cam is sounding grogging running like shit. Then all of the sudden my alarm starts going crazy. Security system won’t lock because it says passenger door is open, which it isn’t. Windows start rolling down and won’t come up, seat is moving on its own, radio shorting out, then truck battery dies and starts right back up but keeps geeking out. Any advice?"

2016 Mustang. Fluffy fungi like mass on positive battery terminal.
That above and car won’t start. Whenever I tried starting ing all the electronics will go haywire and it would sound like a dead battery. I took a brush and brushed those Debree off and cleared up the terminal. Then the car steered few mins later. 

So what should I do now ? Clean up the terminal with baking soda? Anything else I should look for ? Why does something like that happen ?"

Ford Ranger Transmission
I just completed a clutch installation in a 2008 ford ranger, manual 2.3L. As well as the clutch kit, I replaced the rear main seal, flywheel, and master and slave cylinders. Today I finished putting everything back together, filling trans fluid, etc. I bled the system and started the truck, and it won’t go in gear. It almost is like it’s stuck in neutral, but has a limited range of motion. Once the truck is started, emergency brake disengaged, and what seems to be neutral with the clutch pedal all the way in, to the floor, the truck starts driving in reverse. It wouldn’t go into any gear at all, just stuck in reverse even though shifter appears to be in neutral. The only way to stop it was to apply full pressure to the brakes and turn the truck off. Anyone have any idea as to what i could’ve done wrong? There is a small acces/viewing port on the bottom of the trans and the whole clutch assembly seems to be perfectly fine, all torqued to spec. I never opened up the transmission or anything of that sorts. "

02 Buick Rendezvous won’t start
Hello! I’ll try to give as much info as I can, but I’m not super familiar with cars. Our car started having issues about 2 months ago. It would randomly not start. It sounds like it wants to turn over, but won’t. 

We’ve taken it to the mechanic twice. The first time, they replace the fuel filter and fuel pump. It worked for 2 days, then wouldn’t start again. We took it back, and they replaced some wires, a fuel injector, and some relays. It worked for a day. 

It’s been about a month, and it’s still not starting. My husband check all the fuses and they looked good. Honestly, we don’t have the money to take it back for a third time and it not work. If you guys have any advice I would really really appreciate it. Thank you so much. "
